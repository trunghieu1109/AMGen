        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

        "n": "abstract_workflow_1",
        "response": "To calculate the total time for walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h including t minutes in the coffee shop, we first need to determine the time taken to walk 9 kilometers at that speed. Given s = 1.5, the speed s + 0.5 is 2.0 km/h. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at 2.0 km/h is 9 / 2.0 = 4.5 hours, which is 270 minutes. We then add the time spent in the coffee shop, t = 120 minutes, to this walking time. Therefore, the total time is 270 + 120 = 390 minutes. However, the calculations involve multiple steps and may require careful algebraic manipulation.\n\nAnswer:390\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Please confirm the values of s and t or provide additional constraints to simplify the problem.",

        "response": "To finalize the calculated time, we need to ensure that the time spent walking at the speed of s + 1/2 km/h is correctly calculated and that the time spent in the coffee shop is appropriately included. The walking speed was found to be 2 km/h, leading to a walking time of 4.5 hours. After adding the time spent in the coffee shop, we arrive at a total of 390 minutes. However, the interpretation of whether the coffee shop time should be added to the walking time or considered separately can affect the final answer.\n\nAnswer:390\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Please clarify if the coffee shop time should be added to the walking time or considered separately.",
