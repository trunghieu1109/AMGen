Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_56_157
proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor typically results in the mutant protein interfering with the function of the wild-type protein. This interference often occurs through the formation of non-functional dimers, where the mutant protein binds to the wild-type protein and prevents it from functioning properly. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype in the presence of mutation Y would be 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype'. This is because the mutant protein aggregates with the wild-type protein, preventing proper dimerization and function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in the presence of a wild-type allele. This aligns with the understanding that dominant-negative mutations can lead to more severe phenotypic effects due to their interference with the normal function of the wild-type protein.
