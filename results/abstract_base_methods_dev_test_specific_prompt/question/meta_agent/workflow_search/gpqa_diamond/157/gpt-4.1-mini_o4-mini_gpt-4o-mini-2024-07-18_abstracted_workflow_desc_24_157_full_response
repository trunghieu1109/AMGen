In contrast, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain (mutation Y) allows mutant subunits to bind wild-type subunits, forming defective dimers that cannot properly dimerize/nuclear‐translocate or bind DNA. These mixed oligomers often misfold or aggregate, sequestering wild-type protein and leading to a loss‐of‐function phenotype even when one wild-type allele is present. This molecular phenotype best matches protein aggregation and loss-of-function (choice B).; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent lggL, distinguishing mutation types, thinking: Recessive loss‐of‐function mutations abolish function only of the mutant protein; in heterozygotes the wild‐type subunit still dimerizes correctly and activates transcription (no phenotype). Dominant‐negative mutations in a dimerization domain, however, allow the mutant subunit to bind the wild‐type subunit and form nonfunctional or aggregated complexes, thereby inactivating the wild‐type allele’s function and producing a loss‐of‐function phenotype even in heterozygotes.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent jR5l, distinguishing mutation types, thinking: Recessive loss‐of‐function mutations simply inactivate only the mutant allele without affecting the wild‐type protein—they require homozygosity to see a phenotype. In contrast, a dominant‐negative mutation in the dimerization domain allows the mutant subunit to bind wild‐type subunits, forming nonfunctional heterodimers (or higher‐order aggregates) that sequester and inactivate the wild‐type protein.

These aberrant complexes can aggregate, sequester the wild-type protein, and prevent formation of functional dimers. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype even though one allele is normal. Therefore, the heterozygous dominant-negative mutation Y leads to protein aggregation and overall loss of transcription factor activity.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 0YKd, providing feedback, thinking: While the analysis correctly notes that a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain can form nonfunctional heterodimers with wild-type subunits—sequestering them and causing a loss-of-function phenotype—it overemphasizes protein aggregation without direct experimental evidence. Not all dominant-negative mutants visibly aggregate; some simply disrupt dimerization or nuclear import. The discussion also omits considerations of protein stability, degradation pathways, dosage effects, and interactions with other partners. Experimental validation (e.g., co-immunoprecipitation, imaging studies) is needed to confirm aggregation and exclude alternative mechanisms.; answer: protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 2k1j, refining analysis of dominant-negative mutation effects, thinking: A heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain produces mutant subunits that still bind wild-type subunits, forming nonfunctional heterodimers (or higher-order complexes) that sequester the wild-type protein.
