Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_176
proposed answer: The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, indicating they have the same temperature. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since the temperatures are the same, the luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities do not affect the intrinsic luminosity calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is A) ~2.25.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and both stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating the same temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the luminosity of a star is proportional to the square of its radius and the fourth power of its temperature. Since the temperatures are the same, the luminosity ratio depends solely on the square of the radius ratio. Therefore, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities do not affect this calculation as they pertain to the Doppler effect, which is already accounted for in the peak wavelength determination. All agents agree that the correct luminosity ratio is 2.25, which matches choice A.
