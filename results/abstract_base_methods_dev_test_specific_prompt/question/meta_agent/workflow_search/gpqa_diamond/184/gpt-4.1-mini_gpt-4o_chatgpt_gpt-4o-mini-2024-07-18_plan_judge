proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the operator σ · n are known to be ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H are obtained by multiplying these eigenvalues by the constant ε, resulting in eigenvalues ±ε. Comparing these results with the given multiple-choice options, choice A) '+ ε, -ε' matches the calculated eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian.
