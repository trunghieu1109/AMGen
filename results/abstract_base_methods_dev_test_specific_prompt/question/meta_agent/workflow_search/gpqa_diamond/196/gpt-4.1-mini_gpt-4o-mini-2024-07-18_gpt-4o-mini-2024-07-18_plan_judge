proposed answer: The reaction of Compound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, with red phosphorus and HI leads to the reduction of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. This reduction typically converts the carboxylic acid into an alkyl group, while the aromatic ring remains intact. The IR data supports the presence of a carboxylic acid due to the strong peak at 1720 cm-1 and the broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1. After the reduction, the carboxylic acid is removed, resulting in the formation of 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This product retains the sec-butyl group and the methyl group on the aromatic ring, which is consistent with the expected outcome of such a reaction. Therefore, the final product structure after the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
