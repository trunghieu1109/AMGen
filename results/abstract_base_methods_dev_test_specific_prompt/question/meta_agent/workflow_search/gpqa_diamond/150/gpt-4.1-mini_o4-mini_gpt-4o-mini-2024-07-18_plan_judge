Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: First, normalize the state ψ=(−1,2,1)ᵀ: ψ̂=(−1/√6,2/√6,1/√6). The operator P has a zero‐eigenvector φ corresponding to eigenvalue 0, which from Sub-task 3 is φ=(1,0,−1)/√2. Compute the overlap amplitude ⟨φ|ψ̂⟩ = (1/√2)(−1/√6)+(−1/√2)(1/√6) = −2/√12 = −1/√3. The probability is |⟨φ|ψ̂⟩|² = (1/√3)² = 1/3, matching choice A).
