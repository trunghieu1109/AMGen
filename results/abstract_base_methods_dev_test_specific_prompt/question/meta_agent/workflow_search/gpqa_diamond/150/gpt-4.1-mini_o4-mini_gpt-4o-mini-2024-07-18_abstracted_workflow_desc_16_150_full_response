The matrix P has off-diagonal entries a=1/√2 in positions (1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2). The equations are: a\u2009y=0 ⇒ y=0; a\u2009x + a\u2009z=0 ⇒ x+z=0 ⇒ z=−x. Thus the zero‐eigenvalue subspace is one‐dimensional, spanned by (1,0,−1)^T. One may normalize it to (1/√2,0,−1/√2)^T.; answer: Eigenvector for λ=0: any scalar multiple of (1,0,−1)^T (normalized as (1/√2,0,−1/√2)^T).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent byh9, providing feedback, thinking: The vector (1,0,−1)^T (or normalized to (1/√2,0,−1/√2)^T) indeed spans the zero‐eigenvalue subspace of P, so the identification is algebraically correct. However, because the nullspace is one‐dimensional, this eigenvector is only determined up to an arbitrary nonzero scalar multiple (and, in a complex Hilbert space, an overall phase). To use it in a physical context requiring an orthonormal basis, one must explicitly normalize it, and its global sign or phase remains undetermined. No other independent eigenvectors exist for λ=0 since its multiplicity is one.; answer: Eigenvector for λ=0: any scalar multiple of (1,0,−1)^T (normalized as (1/√2,0,−1/√2)^T). Limitation: unique only up to an overall scalar (or phase) with no further independent vectors due to one‐dimensional degeneracy.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Dt07, refining eigenvectors, thinking: To find the eigenvector(s) v=(x,y,z)^T satisfying P\u2009v=0, write out the equations using P’s nonzero entries a=1/√2 in positions (1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2):\n1) (Pv)_1 = a·y = 0 ⇒ y=0\n2) (Pv)_2 = a·x + a·z = 0 ⇒ x+z=0 ⇒ z=−x\n3) (Pv)_3 = a·y = 0 ⇒ y=0 (redundant)\nThus the nullspace is one–dimensional, spanned by (1,0,−1)^T.
