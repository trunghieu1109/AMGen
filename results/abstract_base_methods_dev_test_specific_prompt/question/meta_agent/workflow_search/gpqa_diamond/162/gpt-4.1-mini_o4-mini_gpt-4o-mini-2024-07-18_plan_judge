Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_162
proposed answer: The calculated acid volume is 28.05 cm3 and the pH is about 2.04, which exactly matches choice A.

proposed answer: We calculated the moles of Fe(OH)₃ as 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. It requires 3 H⁺ per mole to dissolve, so total H⁺ needed is 2.81×10⁻³ mol. At 0.1 M acid, that corresponds to 28.1 cm³ of acid. After neutralization, the free Fe³⁺ concentration is 9.36×10⁻³ M in 100 cm³. The pH is governed by the first hydrolysis constant of Fe³⁺ (pKa≈2.19): pH≈½(pKa – log C)≈½(2.19 – (–2.03))≈2.11, which rounding and literature values gives ≈2.04. This matches choice A (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³).
