Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_187
proposed answer: The calculated interplanar spacing d₁₁₁≈9.54 Å exactly matches choice A’s value of 9.54 Å. The other options (8.95 Å, 9.08 Å, 10.05 Å) differ more significantly, so A) is clearly the closest match.
