Using G_ij = a^2 (δ_ij + cosα (1−δ_ij)), its determinant and adjugate yield the reciprocal metric G*_ij. The general result is 1/d_hkl^2 = [ (1+cosα)(h^2+k^2+l^2) + 2(cosα−1)(hk+hl+kl ) ] ⁄ [ a^2 (1−cosα)^2 (1+2cosα) ]. This formula directly follows from G*ij h_i h_j.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 7H12, understand crystal system and formula, thinking: In a rhombohedral lattice with lattice constant a and equal angles α=β=γ, the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) planes is given by:\n\n1/d_{hkl}^2 = (1/a^2) * [h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)cosα] / [1 + 2cosα]^2 * sin^2α\n\nHere α=30°, so cosα=√3/2 and sinα=1/2.

The metric tensor G has diagonal entries g_{ii}=a²=100 Å² and off‐diagonals g_{ij}=a²cosα≈86.60 Å². Its determinant is det(G)=a^6(1+2cos^3α−3cos^2α)≈49000 Å^6.
