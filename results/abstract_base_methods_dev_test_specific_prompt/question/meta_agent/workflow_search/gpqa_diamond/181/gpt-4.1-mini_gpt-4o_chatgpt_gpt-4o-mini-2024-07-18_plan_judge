proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free, single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. This is because the equation describes space-charge-limited current, which assumes no traps, a single type of charge carrier, and no barrier to carrier injection (Ohmic contact). The diffusion current must be negligible for the equation to hold. Choice 1 correctly describes these conditions, stating that the device is trap-free, single-carrier, has no carrier injection barrier (implying an Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current. Other choices either introduce incorrect conditions, such as two-carrier systems, Schottky contacts, or incorrect current considerations. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
