Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_197
proposed answer: The computed concentration of Co(SCN)₂ was 1.692×10⁻³ M out of a total Co concentration of 1.00×10⁻² M, giving (1.692×10⁻³/1.00×10⁻²)×100% ≈16.9%. Among the provided options (16.9%, 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%), the value 16.9% corresponds to option A).
