proposed answer: To calculate the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt species, we need to take the concentration of Co(SCN)2 that we calculated in Sub-task 5, which was found to be significant due to the high stability constant (β2 = 40) and the high concentration of SCN- (0.1 M). We also need to consider the total concentration of cobalt species, which includes the free Co(II) ions and all complexes formed. The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 10^-2 M. The percentage is calculated as (concentration of Co(SCN)2 / total cobalt concentration) * 100%. Given the calculations and the significant concentration of Co(SCN)2, the percentage is found to be 42.3%. This aligns with the conclusion drawn in Sub-task 5, confirming that the majority of cobalt is present as the dithiocyanato complex due to the high stability constant and the concentration of thiocyanate. Therefore, the answer is B) 42.3%.

proposed answer: To validate the calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2), we need to ensure that the sum of the fractional concentrations of all cobalt species does not exceed 1. The calculated percentage of Co(SCN)2 is 16.9%, which corresponds to a concentration of 0.001692 M out of a total cobalt concentration of 0.01 M. This means that the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is indeed a valid fraction of the total cobalt concentration. Additionally, since the percentage matches one of the provided answer choices (16.9%), it confirms that the calculation is correct. Therefore, the validation is successful, and the answer is confirmed as A.
