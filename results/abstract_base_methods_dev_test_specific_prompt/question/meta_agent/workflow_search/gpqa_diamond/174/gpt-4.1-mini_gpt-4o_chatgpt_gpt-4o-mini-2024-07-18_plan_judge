Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_174
proposed answer: All agents have consistently determined that the fraction of maximum power radiated at an angle of 30 degrees is 1/4, and the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is lambda^(-4). These findings match choice C, which specifies both the fraction 1/4 and the wavelength dependence lambda^(-4). Therefore, the correct choice that aligns with the calculated fraction and wavelength dependence is C.
