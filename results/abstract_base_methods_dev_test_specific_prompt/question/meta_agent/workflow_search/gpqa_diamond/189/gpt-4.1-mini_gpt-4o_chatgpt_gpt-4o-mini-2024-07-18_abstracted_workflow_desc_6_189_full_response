Charge: Negatively charged nucleophiles are generally more reactive than neutral ones because they have a higher electron density available to donate.\n2. Electronegativity: Less electronegative atoms tend to be better nucleophiles because they are more willing to share their electrons.\n3. Solvation effects: In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophiles are solvated by hydrogen bonding. Smaller ions are more heavily solvated, which reduces their nucleophilicity. Larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles.\n4. Steric hindrance: Bulky nucleophiles are less reactive because steric hindrance makes it harder for them to approach the electrophile.\n\nBased on these factors, ethanethiolate (5) is likely the most reactive because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen and thus less solvated, making it a strong nucleophile.

Larger ions are less solvated, making them better nucleophiles in such solvents. \n\n4. Steric hindrance: Bulky nucleophiles are less reactive due to steric hindrance, which makes it difficult for them to approach the electrophile. \n\nIn the context of the given nucleophiles, ethanethiolate (5) is a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge and the fact that sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, making it less solvated and more nucleophilic in water.
