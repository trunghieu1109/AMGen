Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene proceeds via a suprafacial [3,3]-sigmatropic shift of the 1,5-diene comprising the vinyl substituent at C2 and the C5–C6 alkene. In this concerted process, the N–C2 and C5–C6 bonds break and new C2–C3 and N–C6 bonds form, converting the bicyclic norbornene framework into a cyclopenta[c]pyridine skeleton. Bridgehead stereochemistry is retained, and the resulting heterocycle is saturated specifically at positions 4, 4a, 7, and 7a. Among the given options, only 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine matches this pattern of saturation and ring connectivity. Therefore, the correct product is choice A).
