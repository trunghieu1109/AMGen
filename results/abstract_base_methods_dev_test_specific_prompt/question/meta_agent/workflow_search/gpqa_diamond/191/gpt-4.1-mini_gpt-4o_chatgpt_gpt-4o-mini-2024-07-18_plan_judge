Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. Due to the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. This is because the conductor redistributes its surface charges to cancel the internal field, resulting in an external field that depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center of the conductor. The distances l, s, and angle θ do not affect the external field due to the symmetry and shielding properties of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is given by E = (1/4πϵ₀) * (q/L²), which corresponds to choice D).
