proposed answer: The electric field at point P, which is outside the spherical conductor, is determined by the behavior of the charge +q placed inside the cavity. The spherical conductor shields the interior charge, and the external electric field can be treated as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. The formula for the electric field due to a point charge at a distance L from the center of the conductor is given by E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²). This is independent of the distance from the cavity center and the angle theta due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Therefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is found in choice 3, which states E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / l²). Hence, the answer is C.

proposed answer: The derived expression for the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor is E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²). This indicates that the electric field depends on the distance L from the center of the spherical conductor to point P. Upon reviewing the options: 1) E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / (l - s cos(θ))²) does not match as it depends on l, not L. 2) E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / (l + s cos(θ))²) also depends on l, making it incorrect. 3) E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / l²) is again dependent on l, not L, so it is not valid. 4) E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²) directly matches the derived expression, as it depends on L, which is the correct distance for the electric field outside the conductor. Therefore, the consistent and correct choice is D.
