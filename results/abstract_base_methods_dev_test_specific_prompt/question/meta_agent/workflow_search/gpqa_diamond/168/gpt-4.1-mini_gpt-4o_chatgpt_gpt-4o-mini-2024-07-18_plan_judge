Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous because the two neutrinos (V) can carry away varying amounts of energy, allowing the E particles to have a range of energies up to the endpoint Q. In the variant decay, where the two neutrinos are replaced by one massless particle M, the spectrum remains continuous because M can also carry away varying amounts of energy. However, since there is only one massless particle instead of two, the E particles can potentially have more energy, leading to an increase in the endpoint energy. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. This reasoning aligns with the consensus among the debate agents, who all concluded that the correct choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
