Three-body decays always produce a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles because the available Q-value can be shared in a continuum among the products. Since M is massless, there is less rest-mass energy carried away, allowing more kinetic energy for the E particles and thus raising the maximum possible energy above the original endpoint Q.

Because energy and momentum can be partitioned continuously among the four outgoing particles, the observed kinetic energy of the two E’s can take on any value from zero up to the maximum when the V’s carry away minimal kinetic energy.

Because there are four final‐state particles sharing energy and momentum, conservation laws allow the summed kinetic energy of the two E’s to vary continuously from near zero (when the V’s carry off most energy) up to a maximum Q (when the V’s carry negligible kinetic energy). Thus the V’s introduce a continuous degree of freedom in how energy is partitioned and set the continuous shape and endpoint Q of the E spectrum.; answer: The two V particles share varying amounts of the decay energy with the E’s, making the E spectrum continuous with endpoint Q.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent tuxD, examining role of V particles, thinking: In the original 2A→2B+2E+2V decay, the two light V particles share variable amounts of momentum and energy with the two E’s. Because there are four bodies in the final state, energy and momentum partition continuously among them, producing a continuous summed E spectrum that extends to the full Q value when both V’s carry essentially zero kinetic energy. The V’s ability to have arbitrarily small kinetic energy (they can be at rest if they are massive or very low‐energy if nearly massless) ensures the endpoint for E stays at Q. Thus, their presence is what broadens the spectrum into a continuum and fixes the endpoint at Q.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent KiaF, examining role of V particles, thinking: In the original decay 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, the two very light V particles can each carry off any fraction of the available energy and momentum. Because there are multiple final‐state particles, energy conservation alone does not fix the energies of the E particles uniquely. Instead the energy can be partitioned continuously among the four outgoing particles. As a result, the summed kinetic energy of the two E’s varies smoothly from zero up to the maximum Q (which occurs when the V’s carry away negligible kinetic energy).

Replacing the two V’s by a single massless M still allows continuous energy sharing between M and the two E’s (three‐body decay → continuous spectrum). Energy conservation gives the same total Q (neglecting tiny V masses), but replacing two light particles by one massless one slightly increases the available kinetic energy for the electrons (since V’s had small mass). Thus the E spectrum remains continuous with a modified shape and a slightly higher endpoint than Q.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent kbiE, providing feedback, thinking: The chain‐of‐thought correctly identifies that replacing two light neutrals V by one massless M preserves a continuous spectrum and shifts the endpoint, but it oversimplifies several kinematic and physical details.; answer: Limitations of the analysis:\n1. Assumes V masses are negligible and treats M as truly massless, ignoring small mass corrections from V and any nonzero M mass.\n2. Neglects nuclear recoil energy, which slightly alters the available Q and endpoint.\n3.

In any three-body decay, energy and momentum can vary continuously among the products, so the summed E spectrum remains continuous. Since M has zero rest mass whereas the two V’s had nonzero mass (even if small), slightly more kinetic energy becomes available to the E’s. Thus the spectral shape shifts but stays continuous, and the endpoint moves upward relative to Q.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 7wCg, determining spectrum changes with M particle, thinking: In replacing the two V particles (each carrying some rest mass) by one massless M, the decay remains a multi–body process (now three bodies: 2B, 2E, M) so energy and momentum can still be shared continuously among the products. The removal of the V rest masses frees up extra kinetic energy for the E particles, shifting the spectrum upward. Thus the E spectrum stays continuous but its maximum (endpoint) rises above the original Q.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent B28x, determining spectrum changes with M particle, thinking: In the original four-body decay (2A→2B+2E+2V), the two emitted V particles, if massive, carry away some rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, leaving a continuous energy distribution for the two E particles up to endpoint Q. Replacing the two V’s by a single massless M reduces the total rest‐mass burden of the decay products. Momentum conservation in a three‐body decay (2A→2B+2E+M) still allows continuous sharing of kinetic energy among the two E’s and M, so the E spectrum remains continuous. Because M is massless, less energy is ‘locked’ in rest mass, leaving more available kinetic energy for the E’s. Thus the maximum possible summed energy of the E particles (the spectral endpoint) increases above the original Q.
