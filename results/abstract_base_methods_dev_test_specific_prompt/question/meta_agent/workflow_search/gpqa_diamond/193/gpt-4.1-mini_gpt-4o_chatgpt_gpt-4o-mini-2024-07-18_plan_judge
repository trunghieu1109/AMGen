Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The computed partition function Z from the sub-task is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). We need to compare this with the given choices: 

Choice 1: Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) - This choice matches exactly with the computed partition function, both in terms of the coefficients and the exponents.

Choice 2: Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ) - This choice has different exponents and does not match the computed partition function.

Choice 3: Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ) - This choice also has different exponents and coefficients, and does not match the computed partition function.

Choice 4: Z = 2 e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ) - This choice has inverted signs in the exponents and does not match the computed partition function.

Therefore, the only choice that matches the computed partition function is choice 1. Hence, the correct answer is A).
