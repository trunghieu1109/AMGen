Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks='Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetries occur when the ground state of a system does not exhibit the symmetry of the underlying laws. This leads to the emergence of Goldstone bosons, which are massless excitations associated with the broken symmetry. Internal symmetries relate to transformations that do not change the spatial configuration, while spatial symmetries involve transformations in space. In the context of the original question, we need to identify which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with such symmetries, while phonons arise from lattice vibrations and do not correspond to a broken symmetry in the same way. Therefore, the answer is D) Phonon.; answer - D\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Goldstone bosons arise from spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries. For instance, pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Magnons are associated with the broken rotational symmetry in ferromagnets. Skyrmions can be viewed as solitons in models that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, particularly in the context of non-linear sigma models. Phonons, however, are related to lattice vibrations and arise from the quantization of normal modes in a solid, which does not directly correspond to a spontaneously-broken continuous symmetry.

Skyrmions arise in models with spontaneously-broken chiral symmetry and can be viewed as topological solitons rather than traditional Goldstone bosons, as they are stable configurations in a field theory that do not correspond to a simple excitation mode. Pions are Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is a fundamental internal symmetry. Phonons, on the other hand, arise from lattice vibrations and do not correspond to a spontaneously-broken symmetry, thus they are not Goldstone bosons. Therefore, the specific symmetries broken are: Magnon - rotational symmetry (Goldstone boson), Skyrmion - chiral symmetry (topological excitation), Pion - chiral symmetry (Goldstone boson), Phonon - no broken symmetry (not a Goldstone boson).; answer - Magnon: Rotational symmetry (Goldstone boson), Skyrmion: Chiral symmetry (topological excitation), Pion: Chiral symmetry (Goldstone boson), Phonon: No broken symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Upon cross-checking the classification of each particle, we find that Magnons and Pions are indeed associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries and are classified as Goldstone bosons.

For instance, pions are Goldstone bosons related to the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Magnons are associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets. Skyrmions can be seen as solitonic solutions that emerge from the breaking of certain symmetries in field theories, particularly in the context of nuclear physics. Phonons, however, are not Goldstone bosons in the same sense; they represent quantized vibrational modes in a lattice and are associated with translational symmetry rather than a spontaneously broken symmetry. Therefore, while pions, magnons, and skyrmions are all examples of Goldstone bosons tied to broken symmetries, phonons do not fit this category.
