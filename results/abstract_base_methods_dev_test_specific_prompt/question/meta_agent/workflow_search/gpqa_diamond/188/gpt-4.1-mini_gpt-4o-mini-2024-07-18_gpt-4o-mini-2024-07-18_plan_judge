proposed answer: Phonons are quantized sound waves that arise from the collective motion of particles in a lattice structure. Their existence does not depend on spontaneously-broken symmetry, unlike Magnons, Skyrmions, and Pions, which are all associated with such symmetries in their respective physical contexts. Magnons are linked to broken rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, Skyrmions to broken chiral symmetry in certain magnetic materials, and Pions to the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Therefore, Phonons are the only effective particles listed that are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

proposed answer: After analyzing the classifications of the particles, it is clear that Magnons and Pions are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries and are categorized as Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions, while related to chiral symmetry, are classified as topological excitations and do not fit the standard definition of Goldstone bosons. Phonons, however, do not arise from spontaneously-broken symmetries and therefore do not qualify as Goldstone bosons. This leads us to conclude that Phonons are the only particle listed that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
