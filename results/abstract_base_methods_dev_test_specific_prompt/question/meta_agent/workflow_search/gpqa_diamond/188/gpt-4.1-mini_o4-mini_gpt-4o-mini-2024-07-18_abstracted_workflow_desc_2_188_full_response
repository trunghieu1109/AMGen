Magnon (A): In a ferromagnet spin-rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken; the low-energy spin waves (magnons) are gapless Goldstone modes.  \n2. Phonon (D): The formation of a crystal lattice breaks continuous translation symmetry; acoustic phonons are gapless Goldstone modes.  \n3. Pion (C): Chiral symmetry in QCD is spontaneously broken, producing (nearly) massless pions as pseudo-Goldstone bosons.  \n4. Skyrmion (B): A Skyrmion is a topological soliton—an extended, gapped field configuration stabilized by topology. It is not a small fluctuation around a vacuum or tied to a broken continuous generator.  \n\nThus, only the Skyrmion fails the criteria for a Goldstone mode. It is not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent bDWR:\nFrom Sub-task 3, we found that magnons (A), phonons (D), and pions (C) all arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin-rotation for magnons, translation for phonons, chiral for pions). A Skyrmion (B), by contrast, is a topological soliton—a finite-energy, gapped configuration stabilized by a nontrivial winding number in the pion field. It is not a small, gapless fluctuation of the order parameter corresponding to any broken continuous generator. Therefore the only effective particle not tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent PbgT:\nFrom Sub-task 3, magnons (A), phonons (D), and pions (C) all arise as Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) bosons from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries and are gapless modes corresponding to broken generators. By contrast, the skyrmion (B) is a topological soliton—an extended, gapped object stabilized by topology rather than a small fluctuation around an ordered vacuum. It does not meet the criteria for a Goldstone mode and thus is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YlY6:\nAmong the four, magnons (A), phonons (D), and pions (C) all arise as (pseudo‐)Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotation, translation, chiral symmetry). Skyrmions (B), by contrast, are topological solitons—gapped, localized configurations stabilized by topology rather than small fluctuations of an order parameter.

Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks='Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously‐broken symmetry occurs when the lowest‐energy state (the vacuum or ordered phase) of a system fails to share a continuous symmetry of the underlying laws (Hamiltonian or Lagrangian). In such cases, the system chooses a particular orientation in the order‐parameter space, breaking the symmetry in the ground state. According to Goldstone’s theorem, each broken continuous generator gives rise to a massless (gapless) excitation—an effective particle called a Nambu–Goldstone boson. \n\nEffective particles arise as low‐energy collective excitations or topological configurations of the order parameter field. To determine whether an effective particle is tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking, we check:\n1) Does the particle correspond to fluctuations of the order parameter around one of its degenerate minima?  \n2) Is it gapless, reflecting the broken continuous symmetry?  \n3) Does its existence require the vacuum to pick a direction in the broken symmetry group?  \n\nIf an excitation is a local fluctuation mode around a chosen vacuum and is gapless, it is a Goldstone mode from a spontaneously broken symmetry. If instead it’s a topological soliton or bound state whose stability stems from topology rather than a broken continuous generator, it is not directly a Goldstone excitation.; answer - A spontaneously‐broken symmetry arises when the ground state does not share a continuous symmetry of the system’s laws, leading to degenerate vacua.

Underlying Heisenberg Hamiltonian has continuous spin‐rotation symmetry, but the ordered ferromagnetic ground state chooses a spin direction, breaking SU(2)→U(1). The low‐energy gapless magnon is the associated Goldstone mode.\n\nSkyrmion: topologically stable soliton in a field with nontrivial π2 homotopy (e.g. magnetic textures or non‐linear sigma models). Its stability comes from topology (winding number) rather than small fluctuations around a degenerate vacuum of a broken continuous symmetry. There is no gapless mode tied to creating a Skyrmion; it is not itself a Goldstone boson.\n\nPion: in QCD, approximate Nambu–Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous breaking of SU(2)L×SU(2)R chiral symmetry down to SU(2)V. They are light (pseudo)‐Goldstone modes associated with broken axial generators.\n\nPhonon: crystal lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry to discrete translations. The gapless acoustic phonons are the Nambu–Goldstone modes of that broken symmetry.\n\nOnly the skyrmion is not a Goldstone excitation of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent eBuF, describing effective particles and their origin, thinking: Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, the continuous spin‐rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state choosing a magnetization direction. Small transverse fluctuations of the order parameter (spin waves) are gapless Nambu–Goldstone modes, hence magnons are Goldstone bosons of broken spin symmetry.\n\nSkyrmion: A topological soliton solution in certain field theories or magnetic textures. Its stability arises from nontrivial mapping (winding number) of space into order-parameter space rather than fluctuation around a vacuum. It is not gapless nor tied to a broken continuous generator but is a localized, finite-energy topological excitation.\n\nPion: In quantum chromodynamics, the approximate chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_V. The pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons associated with this broken chiral symmetry; they are light and correspond to fluctuations in the chiral order parameter.\n\nPhonon: In a crystalline solid, continuous translational symmetry of the underlying laws is spontaneously broken when the lattice forms. Small displacements of atoms correspond to gapless phonon modes, the Goldstone bosons of broken translation symmetry.\n\nThus, magnons, pions, and phonons are gapless Nambu–Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons not associated with a broken continuous generator.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent v1Tx, describing effective particles and their origin, thinking: Magnon: in a ferromagnet the underlying spin‐rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken (the spins pick a direction), so low‐energy spin waves (magnons) are gapless Nambu–Goldstone modes.\n\nPhonon: in a crystal the continuous translational symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken by the formation of a periodic lattice, yielding gapless lattice vibrations (phonons) as Goldstone bosons.\n\nPion: in low‐energy QCD the approximate chiral SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry of massless up and down quarks is spontaneously broken to the vector subgroup, giving nearly massless pions as (pseudo) Nambu–Goldstone bosons.\n\nSkyrmion: a topological soliton solution in a non‐linear sigma model or effective pion field, stabilized by a nontrivial winding number; it is a localized topological object, not a gapless fluctuation around a chosen vacuum direction, and thus not a Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent BNoO, evaluating association with spontaneously-broken symmetry, thinking: Evaluate each excitation using the criteria: (1) Is there a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry? (2) Does it correspond to gapless fluctuations about the chosen vacuum? (3) Is it a Goldstone mode rather than a topological soliton?\n\nMagnon (A): In a ferromagnet, spin‐rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and spin waves are gapless Goldstone modes. Meets all criteria.\n\nPhonon (D): In a crystal, continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken, and lattice vibrations are gapless Goldstone bosons. Meets all criteria.\n\nPion (C): In QCD with approximate chiral symmetry, chiral SU(2)×SU(2) breaks to SU(2), yielding (pseudo)‐Goldstone pions. They are (nearly) gapless and arise from broken generators.\n\nSkyrmion (B): A topological soliton in the pion field, stabilized by a nontrivial winding number. It is a localized, gapped configuration and not a Goldstone fluctuation around a chosen vacuum direction. It does not arise from a broken continuous generator.\n\nTherefore, the only effective particle not associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry is the Skyrmion.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 4swB, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly applies the three Goldstone‐mode criteria—identifying magnons, phonons, and pions as gapless fluctuations of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries and singling out skyrmions as topological solitons rather than Goldstone bosons. However, it omits several caveats: it treats chiral symmetry in QCD as exact (where pions are truly gapless) even though it is only approximate and pions are pseudo‐Goldstone with a small mass; it assumes infinite systems and neglects finite‐size gaps or boundary conditions; it does not address explicit symmetry breaking (e.g., spin‐orbit coupling in magnets or lattice pinning in crystals) that can gap would‐be Goldstone modes; and it overlooks that skyrmions require a nontrivial field topology and boundary conditions for stability. Incorporating these effects can modify both the gaplessness and classification of excitations.; answer: Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent BNoO, refining evaluation, thinking: We apply the three criteria for a Goldstone mode: (1) arises from fluctuations of an order parameter around a chosen vacuum, (2) is gapless, (3) corresponds to a broken continuous generator. \n\nMagnon (A): In a ferromagnet spin‐rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and spin waves are gapless Goldstone modes.
