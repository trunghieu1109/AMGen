When treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic HCl, the ketone group at the 1-position reacts with the hydrazide to form a hydrazone. The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the hydrazide nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon, followed by elimination of water, forming a hydrazone linkage. The p-toluenesulfonyl group is attached to the nitrogen of the hydrazone, resulting in a tosylhydrazone. The benzyloxymethyl and prop-1-en-2-yl groups remain unchanged.

When subjected to hydrogenation with Pd/C, the benzene ring is typically resistant to hydrogenation under mild conditions, while other unsaturated groups could be reduced. However, in this case, there are no other unsaturated groups present in product 3 that are susceptible to hydrogenation.

Hydrogenation with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere typically reduces double bonds and, in some cases, certain functional groups. However, the benzyl group is a common protecting group that is stable under hydrogenation conditions unless there is a specific catalyst or condition to remove it.
