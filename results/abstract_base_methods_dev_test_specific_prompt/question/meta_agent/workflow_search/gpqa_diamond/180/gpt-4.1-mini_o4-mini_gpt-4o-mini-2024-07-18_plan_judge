Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_180
proposed answer: With the pp-III branch turned off, the monoenergetic 862 keV line vanishes, leaving only the low-level continuum flux (~1×10^7 cm⁻2 s⁻1) in both the 700–800 keV and 800–900 keV bands. Since both bands now have essentially the same continuum flux, their ratio is unity.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_180
proposed answer: Stopping the pp-III branch eliminates all 8B continuum neutrinos. The 700–800 keV window only contains 8B neutrinos, so its flux drops to zero. The 800–900 keV window still receives the monoenergetic 7Be neutrinos at 862 keV (from pp-II), so its flux remains finite. Thus Flux(700–800)/Flux(800–900)=0. Since zero isn’t offered, the closest choice is the smallest nonzero option, 10⁻².
