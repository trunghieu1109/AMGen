For the pseudosphere of radius r = 2, we can analyze the area by considering the boundary defined by the circle x^2 + y^2 < 4. As we approach this boundary, the metric diverges, suggesting that the area becomes infinite.

The domain constraint 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 defines a circular region in the xy-plane, which is valid for the pseudosphere. The area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2 can be interpreted in the context of the given metric.

The pseudosphere is characterized by such behavior, where the area diverges as we approach the edge of the defined region. For a radius r=2, the area diverges, confirming that the correct choice is +∞.
