Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the reasoning from the previous sub-tasks, it is clear that the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 has been determined to be approximately 0.9. However, since this value does not directly match any of the provided options, the closest available option is ~ 0.6. This choice has been consistently supported by multiple agents as the best representation of the mass ratio. Therefore, I conclude that the most accurate answer based on the provided choices is ~ 0.6, which corresponds to option C.

proposed answer: The validated mass ratio factor of approximately 0.75 indicates that system_1 is less massive than system_2. Among the provided choices, ~0.7 is the closest to 0.75, making it the most reasonable option based on the calculations and validation of the mass ratio. This aligns with the observed data that suggests system_2 has more massive stars due to its higher radial velocity amplitudes.
