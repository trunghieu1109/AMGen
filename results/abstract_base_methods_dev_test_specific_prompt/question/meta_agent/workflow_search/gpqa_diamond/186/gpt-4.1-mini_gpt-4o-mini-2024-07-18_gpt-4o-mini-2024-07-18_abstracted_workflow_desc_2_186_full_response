Polaris, with an apparent magnitude of about 1.97, also achieves a sufficient S/N for detectability. The star located at 5 pc with an apparent magnitude of 10 is within the detectable range as well. However, the star at 10 pc with an apparent magnitude of 15 is at the limit of detectability and may not consistently achieve the required S/N. The star at 50 pc has an apparent magnitude of 20, which is too faint for a good S/N, and the star at 200 pc has an apparent magnitude of 25, which is not detectable.

Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc, totaling 3 detectable stars.; answer: B\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent kZAB, calculating apparent magnitudes, thinking: To determine the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, we can use the formula: Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 * (log10(distance in parsecs) - 1). For Canopus and Polaris, we can use their known apparent magnitudes. For the star at 5 pc with an absolute V magnitude of 15, the apparent magnitude would be 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) which calculates to about 10, making it detectable. At 10 pc, it would be 15, at 50 pc, it would be 20, and at 200 pc, it would be 25.

Canopus has an apparent magnitude of about -5.5, and Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.97, both of which are detectable. The other stars have an absolute V magnitude of 15. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the formula: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. For the star at 5 pc, m = 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) ≈ 10, which is detectable. At 10 pc, m = 15, which is at the limit of detectability. At 50 pc, m = 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) ≈ 20, which is not detectable. At 200 pc, m ≈ 25, also not detectable.
