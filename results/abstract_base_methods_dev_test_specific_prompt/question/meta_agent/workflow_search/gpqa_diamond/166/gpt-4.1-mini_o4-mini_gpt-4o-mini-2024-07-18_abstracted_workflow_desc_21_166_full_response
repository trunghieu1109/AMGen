While algebraically correct, this construction assumes coherent states |±α⟩ are orthogonal (they’re not) and ignores contributions from their nonzero overlap ⟨α|−α⟩=e^{−2α^2}. It also treats an infinite‐dimensional oscillator Hilbert space without truncation, so numerical evaluation requires a cutoff.
