proposed answer: The calculated non-Gaussianity value del_b is 2.48, which is the highest among the provided choices (2.48, 0, 1.38, 0.25). This indicates a significant measure of non-Gaussianity, as it reflects the complexity of the non-Gaussian state compared to the Gaussian reference state. Therefore, the correct choice corresponding to this value is A.

proposed answer: In sub-task 6, we need to compare the calculated non-Gaussianity value del_b, which is 2.48, with the provided choices: 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25. The value 2.48 matches exactly with one of the provided choices, which is choice A). Therefore, the correct alphabet choice corresponding to the closest value is A).
