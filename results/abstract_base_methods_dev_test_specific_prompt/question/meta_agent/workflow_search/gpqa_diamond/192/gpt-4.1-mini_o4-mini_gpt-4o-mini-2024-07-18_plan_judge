Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_192
proposed answer: The observed number of stars varies as N(plx)∝1/plx^5 and parallax plx∝1/r. Substituting gives N(r)∝(r)^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval scales as r^5, matching option D.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_192
proposed answer: We have N(p)∝p⁻⁵ and p=1/r. So N(p(r))∝(1/r)⁻⁵=r⁵. To convert from per unit parallax to per unit distance we multiply by |dp/dr|. Since dp/dr=−1/r², |dp/dr|=1/r². Thus N(r)=N(p(r))·|dp/dr|∝r⁵·(1/r²)=r³. Among the choices (~r², ~r⁴, ~r³, ~r⁵), the correct power‐law dependence is ∼r³, which corresponds to choice C).
