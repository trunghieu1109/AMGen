This was derived by considering that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5 and since plx = 1/r, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5. For the number of stars per unit range of distance, we account for the volume of a spherical shell at distance r, which is proportional to r^2, leading to r^5/r^2 = r^3.

This is a fundamental concept in astronomy where the parallax angle decreases as the distance to the star increases. Therefore, if the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx = 1/r into this expression. This gives us the number of stars varying as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which is typically related to the volume of space at that distance.
