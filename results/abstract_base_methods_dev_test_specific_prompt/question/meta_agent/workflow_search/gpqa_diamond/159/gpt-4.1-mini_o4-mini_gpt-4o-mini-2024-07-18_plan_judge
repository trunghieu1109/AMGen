Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: For a circular aperture (N→∞), the far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. Its first two minima occur where the Bessel function J₁(x) zeros at x₁≈3.8317 and x₂≈7.0156. Using the small‐angle approximation θ_m≈x_mλ/(2πa) gives θ₁≈3.8317λ/(2πa)≈0.610λ/a and θ₂≈7.0156λ/(2πa)≈1.115λ/a. The angular separation is θ₂−θ₁≈(1.115−0.610)λ/a≈0.506λ/a, matching choice D).
