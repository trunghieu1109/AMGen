proposed answer: The calculated angular distance between the first two minima for an infinitely large N-sided polygon, which approximates a circle, is 0.610 * λ / a. This matches the choice B) 0.610 \lambda / a. The reasoning is based on the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, where the first minimum occurs at an angle given by θ_min = 1.22 * λ / D, with D being the diameter of the aperture. Since the apothem a is the radius of the circle, the diameter D = 2a, leading to θ_min = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a. Therefore, the correct option is B).

proposed answer: The problem involves an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with N being infinitely large, which effectively makes it a circular aperture. For a circular aperture, the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern is a well-known result: 1.220 * λ / a. This is derived from the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, where the first minimum occurs at an angle θ such that J_1(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0, where J_1 is the Bessel function of the first kind. The first zero of J_1 is approximately 3.832, leading to the first minimum at 1.220 * λ / a. The calculated Δθ in the sub-task was 3.184 * λ / (π * 2a), but this was incorrect for a circular aperture. The correct standard result for a circular aperture is 1.220 * λ / a, which matches choice A. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 1.220 \lambda /a.
