According to the kinetic theory of gases, the mean free path is calculated using the formula λ = kT / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is the pressure.

According to kinetic theory, the mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is the pressure. In an ultra-high vacuum with pressure < 10^-9 Torr, the mean free path is very long due to the low pressure. Mike would have used this relation to calculate λ1 based on the known pressure, temperature, and an assumed or measured value for the molecular diameter. This calculation assumes that the gas behaves ideally and that the collisions are only between gas molecules. When the electron beam is introduced, additional scattering events occur between electrons and gas molecules, which changes the effective mean free path to λ2.; answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined using the relation λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is the pressure.

In an ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is extremely low, which results in a longer mean free path. Mike used these parameters to determine λ1 accurately. The presence of the electron beam changes the situation, as it introduces additional interactions between the electrons and the gas molecules, which can alter the effective mean free path to λ2.; answer: The mean free path λ1 is calculated based on the static vacuum conditions using the formula λ = kT / (√2 * π * d^2 * P), considering the gas molecule properties and vacuum parameters.
