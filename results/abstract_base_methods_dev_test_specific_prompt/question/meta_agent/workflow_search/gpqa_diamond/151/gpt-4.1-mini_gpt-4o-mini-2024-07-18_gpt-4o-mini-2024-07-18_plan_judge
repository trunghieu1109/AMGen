Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: In the context of the mating response in yeast, the formation of the shmoo indicates active transcriptional processes. The pre-initiation complex is crucial for the transcription of mating genes and would be enriched in the active chromatin of the shmoo. The enhancer protein complex also plays a role in enhancing transcription and is likely to be present. The nucleosome histone complex, while important for maintaining chromatin structure, does not specifically indicate active transcription and may not show significant enrichment in this context. The pre-replication complex, on the other hand, is primarily associated with DNA replication and is not directly involved in transcriptional activation. Therefore, it is the least expected to be present in the active chromatin during the mating response, making it the least observed in the chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry assay targeting active chromatin in the shmoo.
