Therefore vmax/c=√[1−1/γ^2]=√[1−1/(1+½kA^2/(mc^2))^2]. This matches exactly choice 2. Choice A has an incorrect sign and form, choice C is dimensionally inconsistent (missing c^2 in the denominator), and choice D is the classical result ignoring relativistic effects. Thus the correct expression is B).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent oHO1:\nFrom the energy at the turning point we have E = mc² + ½kA², so γ = E/(mc²) = 1 + kA²/(2mc²). Hence v_max/c = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √[1 - 1/(1 + kA²/(2mc²))²]. Comparing this with the choices: A) has a plus sign under the root and incorrect denominator, C) misplaces c² in the denominator, D) is the nonrelativistic limit. Only B) matches exactly v_max = c√(1 - 1/(1 + kA²/(2mc²))²).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent KNDF:\nWe start from energy conservation: at the turning points x=±A the kinetic energy is zero and the total energy is E=mc²+½kA². Thus the Lorentz factor at maximum speed is γ=E/(mc²)=1+½(kA²)/(mc²). The corresponding v_max follows from γ=1/√(1−(v_max/c)²) ⇒ (v_max/c)²=1−1/γ² = 1−1/[1+½(kA²)/(mc²)]². This exactly matches choice 2. Examining the other options: A) has the wrong sign inside the square root and does not simplify to our expression; C) has no factors of c² in the denominator and a wrong dependence; D) is the classical result v_max=√(kA²/m) neglecting relativity. Therefore, the only expression consistent with the relativistic derivation is choice B).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent PqsM:\nWe derived v_max/c = √[1 – 1/γ²] with γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Solving γ=1+½kA^2/(mc^2) and using v/c=√(1–1/γ^2) yields v_max=c√[1–1/(1+½kA^2/(mc^2))^2], which matches choice 2. However, it assumes an ideal Hookean spring with instantaneous force transmission (no retardation), neglects the spring’s field energy and any radiation damping, and treats the motion purely classically (no quantum effects). At very large amplitudes (kA^2∼mc^2) the spring constant would in reality change and signal delays in the elastic medium become important, so the simple relativistic point‐mass oscillator model breaks down.; answer: v_max = c √[1 – 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2], valid only for a one‐dimensional ideal Hookean oscillator without radiation or retardation effects and for amplitudes where the spring remains linear and instantaneous.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent X5c8, refining v_max relation, thinking: Using energy conservation: at the turning point x=A, v=0 so E_tot=mc²+½kA².
