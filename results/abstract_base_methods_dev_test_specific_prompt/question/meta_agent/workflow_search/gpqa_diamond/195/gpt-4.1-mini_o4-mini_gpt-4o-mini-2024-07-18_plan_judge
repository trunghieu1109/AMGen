Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: At the turning points the total energy is E=mc²+½kA², so γ=E/(mc²)=1+½(kA²)/(mc²). The maximum speed satisfies (v_max/c)²=1−1/γ²=1−1/[1+½(kA²)/(mc²)]², which exactly matches choice 2. Choices A and C have incorrect signs or units, and D is the nonrelativistic limit. Therefore the correct expression is B).
