As a result the absolute para-isomer fractions are only rough estimates and can differ substantially when reaction parameters change.; answer: This data set is limited because it mixes results from non-uniform experimental conditions, uses weight rather than molar yields, omits details on reagent purity or catalysts, ignores effects of temperature, solvent and bromine concentration on selectivity, and offers no error analysis—therefore the para-isomer percentages should be treated as approximate trends, not precise values.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent YaoA, refining quantitative data compilation, thinking: Compiled para-isomer weight fractions for bromination under typical conditions (solvent: CH2Cl2 or CCl4, room temperature, Br2/FeBr3 catalyst) from standard sources (March’s Advanced Organic Chemistry, Organic Reactions series, J.
