proposed answer: From Sub-task 4 we obtained the increasing para‐isomer yield order 4<6<2<3<1<5. Comparing to the given choices, none match exactly. Option B) is the only one that starts with 4 and ends with the correct relative order 3<1<5, differing only by swapping 2 and 6. It is clearly the closest and therefore the best available match.

Answer:B)
