Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_39_155
proposed answer: After analyzing the outcomes from both subtask 4 and subtask 5, it is clear that the reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene yield a total of 4 distinct diastereomers. In a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, these diastereomers will be separated and observed as 4 distinct peaks. Similarly, a chiral HPLC column can also differentiate between these diastereomers, resulting in 4 distinct peaks as well. Therefore, both chromatograms will show 4 peaks, which corresponds to choice 1: '4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC'. This conclusion is supported by the consistent reasoning across multiple analyses.

proposed answer: After reviewing the outcomes from subtasks 6 and 7, I confirm that the standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column shows 2 distinct peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic mixture of enantiomers. The chiral HPLC column shows 3 distinct peaks: one for the meso compound and two for the separated enantiomers. This aligns with the original question's choice 3, which states '2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC'. Therefore, the final answer choice is B).
