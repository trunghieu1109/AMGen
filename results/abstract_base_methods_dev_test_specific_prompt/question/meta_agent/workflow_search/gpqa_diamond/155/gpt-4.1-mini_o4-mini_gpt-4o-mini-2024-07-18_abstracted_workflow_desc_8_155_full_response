Acid opening proceeds with trans (anti) addition to give only the meso-4,5-octanediol (R,S configuration, but overall meso). No enantiomers are formed.; answer - Only one stereoisomer: the meso-4,5-octanediol (anti diol).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The epoxidation of a (Z)-alkene (cis arrangement of substituents) by syn addition with mCPBA gives the cis‐disubstituted epoxide, which in the case of nonidentical substituents is meso (it has an internal mirror plane). Acid‐catalyzed ring opening of that meso epoxide proceeds by anti addition of water to give the anti diol, but since the starting epoxide was meso there is only one diastereomer (the meso diol).

Acid‐catalyzed anti opening of each enantiomer gives the corresponding trans diol enantiomers (a racemate). From (Z)-oct-4-ene: syn epoxidation of a cis alkene gives a cis epoxide, which is meso (internal mirror plane); anti opening gives the same meso diol. Thus the combined mixture contains three stereoisomers: two enantiomers from the E‐alkene and one meso diol from the Z‐alkene.

On a standard (achiral) HPLC column the two enantiomers cannot be distinguished and coelute, while the meso diol elutes separately, giving two peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, all three stereoisomers are resolved, yielding three distinct peaks.
