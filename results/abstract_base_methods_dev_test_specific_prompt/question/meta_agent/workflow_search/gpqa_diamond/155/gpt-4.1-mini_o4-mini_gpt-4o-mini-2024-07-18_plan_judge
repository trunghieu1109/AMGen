Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene followed by acid‐catalyzed opening yields a racemic trans-diol (two enantiomers), while the (Z)-alkene gives a single meso diol. In an achiral RP‐HPLC column, enantiomers coelute, so the racemate appears as one peak and the meso compound as a second peak (2 peaks total). On a chiral column, the enantiomers are resolved into two separate peaks and the meso diol remains a single third peak (3 peaks total). This corresponds to choice C).
