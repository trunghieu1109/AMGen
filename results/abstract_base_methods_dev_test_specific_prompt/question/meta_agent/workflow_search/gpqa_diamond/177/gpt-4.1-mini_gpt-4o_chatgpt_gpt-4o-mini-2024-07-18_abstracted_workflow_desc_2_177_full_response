In quantum field theory, a theory is considered renormalizable if the coupling constants in the Lagrangian have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because interactions with non-negative mass dimensions do not introduce new divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Since the mass dimension of \\( \\kappa \\) is negative, it indicates that the interaction introduces divergences that cannot be renormalized by a finite number of terms, making the theory non-renormalizable.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent IZe1, round 0, assessing renormalizability, thinking: The mass dimension of the coupling constant \\( \\kappa \\) was determined to be -1 in sub-task 3. According to the criterion for renormalizability, a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension indicates that the interaction is non-renormalizable.
