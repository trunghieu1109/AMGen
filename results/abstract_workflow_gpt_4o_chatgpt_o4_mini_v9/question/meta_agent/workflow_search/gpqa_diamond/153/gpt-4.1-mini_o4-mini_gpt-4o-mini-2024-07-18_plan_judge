Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_153
proposed answer: The IR broad band (3500–2700 cm⁻¹) and sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band indicate a carboxylic acid. The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak (~32%) is consistent with one Cl atom. The ¹H NMR shows a 1H singlet at 11.0 ppm (COOH) and two 2H doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm (AA’BB’ pattern), indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the data.

proposed answer: The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak ratio of ~3:1 indicates one Cl atom. IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H stretch and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O stretch characteristic of a carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR displays a 11.0 ppm singlet (COOH) and an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern (two doublets integrating to 2H each at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm), consistent with para substitution on the benzene ring. Of the given choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all spectral data.
