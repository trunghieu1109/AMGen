proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is defined as H = ε σ·n, where σ are the dimensionless Pauli matrices with eigenvalues ±1. The factor ħ/2 appears only when defining the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ, not in H. Therefore the eigenvalues of H are simply ±ε with no explicit ħ/2 factor.

Answer:The ħ/2 factor should not appear explicitly in the eigenvalues of H; they are ±ε.
