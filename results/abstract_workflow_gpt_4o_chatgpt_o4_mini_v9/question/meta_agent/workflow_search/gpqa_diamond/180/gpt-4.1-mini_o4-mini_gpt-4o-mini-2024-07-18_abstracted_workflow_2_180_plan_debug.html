    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on Sub-task 4 output, compute the approximate ratio of fluxes Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) under the condition that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, using flux values before and after stoppage, and interpret the result in context of the provided multiple-choice answers. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent N0ab:
Band 1 flux goes to zero (pp-III exclusively), band 2 remains almost unchanged. So flux1/flux2 ≃ 0/(nonzero) ≃ 0. The closest offered nonzero choice is 10^−2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 8Rlw:
Stopping the pp-III branch cuts the 700–800 keV band to zero flux, while the 800–900 keV band is essentially unchanged (≲0.1% loss). Thus Flux1≈0, Flux2≈original, so Flux1/Flux2≈0, which among the given options is best represented by 10^−2 (the smallest nonzero option).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent N0ab:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 8Rlw:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the approximate ratio Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) and select the best matching multiple-choice answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Stopping pp-III removes all neutrinos in the 700–800 keV range (band 1), while the 800–900 keV band (band 2) remains essentially at its original flux. Thus Flux1/Flux2 ≃ 0, and the closest nonzero option offered is 10⁻².
