    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the approximate flux ratio after pp-III branch stops. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent FtCO:
From the derived flux changes |ΔΦ₁|≈2.5×10² and |ΔΦ₂|≈3.2×10², the ratio ≈2.5/3.2≈0.78, which is closest to unity.

### answer by Final Decision Agent FtCO:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the computed flux ratio to the provided multiple-choice options (0.1, 10, 1, 0.01) and select the closest approximate value.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
