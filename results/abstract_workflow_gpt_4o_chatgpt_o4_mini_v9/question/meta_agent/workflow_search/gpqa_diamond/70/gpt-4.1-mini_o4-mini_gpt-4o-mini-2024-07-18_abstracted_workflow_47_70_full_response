Assuming a base unit where Planet_1’s period is 1, the others follow directly from the ratio.; answer: Orbital periods in relative units:\nPlanet_1 = 1\nPlanet_2 = 2\nPlanet_3 = 2.5\nPlanet_4 = 3.5\nPlanet_5 = 5\nCoT agent OTuo, restating assumptions, thinking: The user requests a restatement of the assumption regarding albedo and orbital shape and its implication via Kepler's law. This is straightforward to articulate, so no additional information is needed.; answer: We assume all five planets have the same albedo and travel on circular orbits, so their equilibrium temperatures depend only on their distances from the star. By Kepler’s third law (P² ∝ a³), the orbital period P relates to semi-major axis a, implying T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/² ∝ P⁻¹/³.\nCoT agent cyJp, calculating orbital radii, thinking: By Kepler’s third law for circular orbits, a ∝ P^(2/3). With P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5, we compute a2 ∝ 2^(2/3) and a4 ∝ 3.5^(2/3). Numerically 2^(2/3) ≈ 1.587 and 3.5^(2/3) ≈ 2.305.; answer: Planet_2: a2 ∝ (2)^(2/3) ≈ 1.59; Planet_4: a4 ∝ (3.5)^(2/3) ≈ 2.30\nCoT agent gNtM, deriving temperature formula and calculating ratio, thinking: The equilibrium temperature for a planet with equal albedo and same stellar luminosity scales as Teq ∝ r⁻¹ᐟ². Thus T4/T2 = (a4/a2)⁻¹ᐟ² = sqrt(a2/a4). From sub-task 3 a2≈1.587 and a4≈2.305, so T4/T2 = sqrt(1.587/2.305) ≈ sqrt(0.6885) ≈ 0.83, matching choice B).; answer: B)\nDebate agent lgwZ, round 0, comparing temperature ratio and choices, thinking: The calculated ratio T4/T2 ≈0.83 directly matches the provided option ~0.83, which corresponds to choice B).; answer: B)\nDebate agent cu6J, round 0, comparing temperature ratio and choices, thinking: The equilibrium temperature scales as T∝r⁻¹ᐟ².
