    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~0.75&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~0.83&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~0.69&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~0.57&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated equilibrium temperature ratio from Sub-task 5 with the provided multiple-choice options (~0.75, ~0.83, ~0.69, ~0.57) and select the closest matching value. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ESmc:
From Sub-task 5 the computed ratio T4/T2 ≈0.83, which directly matches option B) (~0.83).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1w2M:
The ratio T4/T2 was found to be ≈0.83, which directly matches choice2 (~0.83).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent K2sx:
From Sub-task 5, we found T4/T2≈0.83. Comparing to the options (~0.75, ~0.83, ~0.69, ~0.57), the closest match is ~0.83, corresponding to choice B).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 04W4:
The ratio T4/T2≈1/√1.45≈0.83, which matches option ~0.83.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ESmc:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 1w2M:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent K2sx:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 04W4:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the closest equilibrium temperature ratio.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
