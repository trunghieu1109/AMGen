I will explain that same albedo removes reflectivity differences, so Teq depends only on orbital distance via the inverse-square law and blackbody balance, yielding Teq ∝ r⁻¹ᐟ².; answer: Assuming all planets share the same albedo A means each planet reflects the same fraction of incoming starlight. Thus, the only factor changing their equilibrium temperature T_eq is the incident flux, which falls off as 1/r^2 with orbital radius r. In thermal equilibrium, the absorbed power (∝(1–A)/r^2) equals the emitted blackbody power (∝T_eq^4), giving T_eq = [L(1–A)/(16πσr^2)]^1/4 ∝ r^(-1/2). Therefore, under equal albedo, T_eq scales as the inverse square root of the orbital radius.\nCoT agent 3fzq, computed relative orbital radii, thinking: Apply Kepler’s third law: for circular orbits around the same star, orbital radius a ∝ (P^2)^(1/3)=P^(2/3). We know P2=2 and P4=3.5 so we can compute a2 and a4 and their ratio directly.; answer: Using P2=2 and P4=3.5: a2 ∝ 2^(2/3) ≈ 1.59; a4 ∝ 3.5^(2/3) ≈ 2.30. Thus the relative orbital radii are a2:a4 ≈ 1.59:2.30 (or a4/a2 ≈ 1.45).\nCoT agent MYQZ, derived equilibrium temperature formula, thinking: To derive the equilibrium temperature for a planet with the same albedo in a circular orbit, we set the absorbed stellar power equal to the emitted blackbody power. Absorbed power ∝ (1–A)L/(4πr^2), emitted power ∝ 4πr_p^2σT_eq^4. Solving gives T_eq = [L(1–A)/(16πσr^2)]^(1/4), which shows T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2).; answer: T_eq = [L (1 – A) / (16 π σ r^2)]^(1/4), hence T_eq ∝ r^(–1/2).\nCoT agent b14c, calculated equilibrium temperature ratio, thinking: From Sub-task 3: a2∝2^(2/3)≈1.59, a4∝3.5^(2/3)≈2.30 ⇒ r4/r2≈2.30/1.59≈1.45. From Sub-task 4: Teq∝r^(−1/2) ⇒ T4/T2=(r4/r2)^(−1/2)=1/√1.45≈0.83.; answer: B)\nDebate agent ESmc, round 0, selecting closest temperature ratio, thinking: From Sub-task 5 the computed ratio T4/T2 ≈0.83, which directly matches option B) (~0.83).; answer: B)\nDebate agent 1w2M, round 0, selecting closest temperature ratio, thinking: The ratio T4/T2 was found to be ≈0.83, which directly matches choice2 (~0.83).; answer: B)\nDebate agent K2sx, round 0, selecting closest temperature ratio, thinking: From Sub-task 5, we found T4/T2≈0.83.
