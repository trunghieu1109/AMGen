        "response": "To validate \u03b3=54, apply the lab-frame decay law f=exp(\u2212R/(\u03b3c\u03c4)). From the original data (\u03b3\u224820 gives f\u22481/3 at R=30\u2009m) we infer a decay length \u03b3c\u03c4\u224830/|ln(1/3)|\u224827\u2009m, so c\u03c4\u22481.37\u2009m. To achieve f\u22482/3 we solve \u03b3\u2032c\u03c4=30/|ln(2/3)|\u224874\u2009m, giving \u03b3\u2032\u224874/1.37\u224854. This matches the chosen value. Physically, boosting \u03b3 increases the time dilation and thus survival probability in an exponential fashion. Limitations include the assumption of a single proper lifetime (\u03c4), neglect of energy/velocity spread, angular divergence, detector acceptance, and potential interactions with material before decay. Experimental uncertainties in \u03c4 and non-exponential decay modes could shift the exact \u03b3 required.\n\nAnswer:The selected Lorentz factor \u03b3=54 is consistent with the exponential decay law and reproduces the desired ~2/3 survival fraction at R=30\u2009m, within the assumptions of a single lifetime and negligible other effects.",
