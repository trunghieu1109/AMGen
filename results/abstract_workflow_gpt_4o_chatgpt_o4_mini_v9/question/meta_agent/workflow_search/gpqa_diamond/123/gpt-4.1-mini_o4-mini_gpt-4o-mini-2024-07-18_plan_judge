proposed answer: To validate γ=54, apply the lab-frame decay law f=exp(−R/(γcτ)). From the original data (γ≈20 gives f≈1/3 at R=30 m) we infer a decay length γcτ≈30/|ln(1/3)|≈27 m, so cτ≈1.37 m. To achieve f≈2/3 we solve γ′cτ=30/|ln(2/3)|≈74 m, giving γ′≈74/1.37≈54. This matches the chosen value. Physically, boosting γ increases the time dilation and thus survival probability in an exponential fashion. Limitations include the assumption of a single proper lifetime (τ), neglect of energy/velocity spread, angular divergence, detector acceptance, and potential interactions with material before decay. Experimental uncertainties in τ and non-exponential decay modes could shift the exact γ required.

Answer:The selected Lorentz factor γ=54 is consistent with the exponential decay law and reproduces the desired ~2/3 survival fraction at R=30 m, within the assumptions of a single lifetime and negligible other effects.
