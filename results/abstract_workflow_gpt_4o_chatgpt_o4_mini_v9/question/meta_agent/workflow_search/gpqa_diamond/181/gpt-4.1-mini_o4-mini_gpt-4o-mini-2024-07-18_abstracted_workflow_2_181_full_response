This is a direct descriptive task, not multiple choice, so I will provide a complete answer without the [TOO_HARD] marker.; answer: The Mott–Gurney equation J = (9/8)·ε·μ·V²/L³ describes space‐charge‐limited current (SCLC) in a trap‐free, single‐carrier device. Defining parameters: ε is the material’s dielectric permittivity (ε = ε₀·ε_r), μ is the charge carrier mobility (drift velocity per electric field), V is the applied voltage across the device, and L is the active layer thickness. Physical meaning: under high injection, injected carriers outnumber thermally generated ones, build up space charge, and produce a quadratic J–V relation. Assumptions: 1) Single‐carrier transport (e.g. only holes or electrons); 2) Trap‐free material (no deep or shallow traps capturing carriers); 3) Ohmic contacts with negligible injection barrier; 4) Drift‐dominated current (diffusion current is negligible); 5) Uniform, field‐independent mobility; 6) Steady‐state, one‐dimensional transport; 7) Negligible recombination, displacement current, and image‐force effects.\nCoT agent WSRh, analyzing choice statements, thinking: We need to analyze each choice for key SCLC assumptions: trap presence, carrier type, contact injection barrier, and the role of drift vs diffusion. The Mott–Gurney law assumes a trap‐free, single‐carrier device with an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) and drift‐dominated current (negligible diffusion). Other combinations violate one or more assumptions.; answer: Choice1: trap-free single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic), negligible diffusion → matches Mott–Gurney assumptions.\nChoice2: trap-free single-carrier, Ohmic contact but negligible drift current → contradicts drift-dominated SCLC (invalid).\nChoice3: two-carrier device with Ohmic contact → violates single-carrier assumption (invalid).\nChoice4: single-carrier with Schottky contact → injection barrier present (invalid).\nReflexion CoT agent DsvQ, comparing assumptions and evaluating consistency, thinking: Sub-task 1 established that the Mott–Gurney law requires a trap-free, single‐carrier device with Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and drift‐dominated current (negligible diffusion), uniform mobility, etc. Sub-task 2 showed that Choice 1 matches all these criteria, while Choices 2–4 each violate one assumption (negligible drift, two carriers, or Schottky contact). Therefore only Choice 1 is consistent with the Mott–Gurney equation.; answer: A)\nCritic agent Msa0, providing feedback, thinking: The comparison correctly identifies that the Mott–Gurney law assumes a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion). Choice 1 is the only one consistent with all these assumptions; the others each violate at least one requirement.; answer: Choice 1\nReflexion CoT agent DsvQ, refining comparison and evaluation, thinking: Sub-task 1 and 2 identify that the Mott–Gurney equation requires a trap-free, single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion).
