Question: Example(question='Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?', choice1='Cold molecular interstellar medium.', choice2='Cold atomic interstellar medium.', choice3='Warm atomic interstellar medium.', choice4='Warm molecular interstellar medium.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_35
proposed answer: The 3.9 μeV feature corresponds to the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (H I), which in the Milky Way is predominantly absorbed by cold (T∼50–100 K), dense atomic clouds. Thus the cold atomic ISM phase is the best match.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_27_35
proposed answer: The 3.9 µeV (~0.94 GHz) feature corresponds to high-n radio-recombination lines from ionized gas at T≈6000–10000 K, characteristic of the warm phase. Among the provided options, the warm atomic interstellar medium is the closest match.
