The series of platinum fluorides PtF2–PtF6 gives five binary fluorides. A1=PtF6, A2=PtF5, A3=PtF4, A4=PtF2, A5=PtF3. PtF2 has M=195+2×19≈233\u2009g/mol, so its molecular weight falls in the 220–240 range.; answer: A) 220-240\nCoT-SC agent XDxQ, determining formulas and weights of A1, A2, A3, thinking: Sub‐task 1 identified Y as Pt and A1–A5 as PtF6–PtF2. A1 decomposes to A2 + F2, matching PtF6 → PtF5 + F2. A2’s nominal F‐content (~32%) corresponds to PtF5. A3 is formed by direct fluorination: Pt + F2 → PtF4. Using Pt =195.08 and F =19.00 g/mol gives the MWs below.; answer: A1: PtF6, M ≈ 195.08 + 6×19.00 = 309.08 g/mol; A2: PtF5, M ≈ 195.08 + 5×19.00 = 290.08 g/mol; A3: PtF4, M ≈ 195.08 + 4×19.00 = 271.08 g/mol.\nCoT-SC agent Wcnk, determining formulas and weights of A1, A2, A3, thinking: Based on sub‐task 1, Y is Pt and the known xenon‐oxidizing red fluoride is PtF₆ (A1), which decomposes to PtF₅ (A2) + F₂. Direct fluorination of Pt yields PtF₄ (A3). Using atomic weights Pt ≈195.08, F ≈19.00: M(PtF₆)=195.08+6×19.00≈309.08; M(PtF₅)=195.08+5×19.00≈290.08; M(PtF₄)=195.08+4×19.00≈271.08 g/mol.; answer: A1: PtF6, M ≈309.1 g/mol; A2: PtF5, M ≈290.1 g/mol; A3: PtF4, M ≈271.1 g/mol\nCoT-SC agent TGlI, determining formulas and weights of A1, A2, A3, thinking: Based on Sub-task 1, element Y is platinum, giving binary fluorides PtF₂–PtF₆. A1 decomposes to A2 + F₂, matching PtF₆→PtF₅+F₂. A3 is the next lower fluoride from direct fluorination: PtF₄. Using atomic weights Pt≈195.08, F≈19.00: M(PtF₆)=195.08+6×19.00≈309.08; M(PtF₅)=195.08+5×19.00≈290.08; M(PtF₄)=195.08+4×19.00≈271.08.; answer: A1: PtF6, M ≈ 309.08 g/mol; A2: PtF5, M ≈ 290.08 g/mol; A3: PtF4, M ≈ 271.08 g/mol\nReflexion CoT agent GmVi, analyzing A4 and A5 reactions, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we have Y = Pt and A1–A5 are PtF6, PtF5, PtF4, PtF2, PtF3. Reaction of PtF2 (A4) with Pt metal yields PtF3 (A5). In water PtF3 hydrolyzes to Pt(OH)3 and HF.; answer: A4 is PtF2 (platinum(II) fluoride) and A5 is PtF3 (platinum(III) fluoride).\nCritic agent nGLR, feedback on A4/A5 analysis, thinking: The proposed assignment of A4 as PtF2 and A5 as PtF3 is not sufficiently supported. The reaction PtF2 + Pt → PtF3 is neither mass‐balanced nor redox‐balanced, and the suggested hydrolysis to Pt(OH)3 overlooks known condensation and oxidation pathways. Key factors—oxidation states, fluorine transfer feasibility, and precise stoichiometry—were not properly addressed.; answer: A more consistent scenario is A4 = PtF4 and A5 = PtF5, since a 1:1 reaction YF4 + Y → 2\u2009YF5 balances both mass and electrons. In water, PtF5 hydrolyzes to oxyfluoride species (e.g. PtO2F2) and HF. Further quantitative data on fluorine content and reaction yields would confirm these assignments.\nReflexion CoT agent GmVi, refining A4/A5 analysis, thinking: Based on Sub‐task 1, Y = Pt and the only plausible A4 and A5 among known Pt fluorides are PtF2 and PtF3, respectively. However, the reported 1:1 PtF2 + Pt → PtF3 reaction is neither mass- nor redox-balanced, and the hydrolysis of PtF3 to two products is underspecified. Without detailed stoichiometry or mechanism, the assignment remains tentative.; answer: A4 is PtF2 and A5 is PtF3\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the precise redox stoichiometry and reaction mechanism for the 1:1 molar addition of Pt to PtF2 and the conditions/products of A5 hydrolysis.\nCoT agent Im4k, calculating molecular weight range of A4, thinking: Sub-task 1–3 identify Y as Pt, A1=PtF6 (MW≈309.08), A2=PtF5 (MW≈290.08), A3=PtF4 (MW≈271.08), A5=PtF3 (MW≈252.08).
