This is a straightforward data‐extraction task, so no [TOO_HARD] marker is needed.; answer: A1: Bright-red binary compound of element Y and fluorine; decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with mass fraction of F = 31.96 %) and F₂; oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\nA2: Product of A1 decomposition; contains 31.96 % fluorine by mass.\nA3: Binary fluoride of Y obtained by direct fluorination of Y; can interact with xenon.\nA4: Colorless concentrated solution (of a fluoride of Y) used as a reactant; reacts with Y in 1:1 molar ratio under hot conditions to form A5.\nA5: Binary fluoride of Y obtained by adding Y to hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio; decomposes in water to yield two products.\nCoT-SC agent jSTK, identifying element Y and oxidation states, thinking: We need to identify element Y given five binary fluorides, one bright-red compound (A1) that decomposes at 293 K into A2 + F2 and oxidizes xenon. The only known element with five binary fluorides that oxidizes xenon is platinum, whose hexafluoride PtF6 (orange-red) decomposes to PtF5 + F2 at ~293 K and famously oxidizes Xe. The five fluorides are PtF2, PtF3, PtF4, PtF5, PtF6, corresponding to oxidation states +2 through +6. Although some stoichiometric details for A3/A5 fit less perfectly, platinum is the only element matching “five binary fluorides” and xenon oxidation behavior.; answer: Element Y is platinum. Its known binary fluorides are PtF2, PtF3, PtF4, PtF5 and PtF6, corresponding to oxidation states +2, +3, +4, +5 and +6.\nCoT-SC agent PMEj, identifying element Y and oxidation states, thinking: We match the decomposition data: A1 → A2 + F₂, with w(F) in A2 = 31.96%. Solving 3·19/(M_A2)=0.3196 gives M_A2≈178.8, so Y≈121.8→Sb. A1 is thus SbF₄ (unstable red), A2=SbF₃, A3 (direct fluorination) =SbF₅ (strong Xe oxidizer), A4 is HSbF₆ (hexafluoroantimonic acid in HF), A5 a higher Sb–F species. Sb exhibits oxidation states +3, +4, +5 in these fluorides.; answer: Element Y is antimony (Sb). Its fluorides/oxidation states here are: \n• SbF₃ (Sb³⁺)\n• SbF₄ (Sb⁴⁺, A1)\n• SbF₅ (Sb⁵⁺, A3)\n• [SbF₆]⁻ in HSbF₆ (A4), and related polyfluoroantimonate in A5.\nCoT-SC agent 8tmP, identifying element Y and oxidation states, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we have A2 with 31.96% F matching IF3, A1 decomposes to IF3 + F2 matching IF5 behavior, A3 is obtained by direct fluorination (likely IF7), and both A1 and A3 oxidize xenon (strong fluorinating agents). These point to element Y being iodine, which forms known fluorides in oxidation states +1, +3, +5, +7 (and related dimeric species).; answer: Element Y is iodine. Its binary fluorides cover the oxidation states +1 (e.g. I2F2 or IF), +3 (IF3), +5 (IF5), and +7 (IF7).\nReflexion CoT agent 7KQu, determining chemical formulas, thinking: Identification of A1–A3 as PtF₆, PtF₅ and PtF₄ follows from the known Pt–F chemistry and the Xe–oxidation behavior. However, the exact nature of the “colorless concentrated solution” A4 (counter-ion, pH, solvent) and the identity of A5 after reaction with Pt (and its hydrolysis products) cannot be pinned down without more information.; answer: A1: PtF₆\nA2: PtF₅\nA3: PtF₄\nA4: likely a hexafluoroplatinate salt in solution (e.g. K₂PtF₆ or H₂PtF₆)\nA5: the 1:1 addition product of Pt to A4, presumably a lower‐valent fluoroplatinate that hydrolyzes in water\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide details on the counter‐ion or acid/base conditions of A4 and the hydrolysis products of A5 in water to confirm their exact formulas.\nCritic agent vb8F, feedback: The assignments A1 = PtF₆, A2 = PtF₅ and A3 = PtF₄ are correct and align with the fluorine mass fraction and Xe–oxidation data. The proposed formulas for A4 and A5 remain speculative because the nature of the “colorless concentrated solution” and the specific hydrolysis products are not fully defined.; correct: A1: PtF₆\nA2: PtF₅\nA3: PtF₄\nA4: hexafluoroplatinic acid H₂PtF₆ (aq) or a corresponding hexafluoroplatinate salt in a colorless solution\nA5: platinum(IV) fluoride PtF₄ (reduced from H₂PtF₆ by Pt metal), which hydrolyzes to PtO₂ + HF in water\nReflexion CoT agent 7KQu, refining formulas, thinking: Element Y is platinum, giving the known binary fluorides PtF2–PtF6. A1 must be PtF6 (bright red, oxidizes Xe, decomposes to PtF5 + F2), A2 is PtF5 (31.96% F by mass), A3 is PtF4 (obtained by direct fluorination of Pt), A4 is the “colorless concentrated solution” of a hexafluoroplatinate salt, and A5 is the 1:1 Pt addition product of that solution. However, A4’s counter-ion and A5’s exact hydrolysis products are unspecified, so we cannot determine precise formulas for those without more data.; answer: A1: PtF6\nA2: PtF5\nA3: PtF4\nA4: hexafluoroplatinate salt in solution (e.g. K2PtF6 or H2PtF6)\nA5: 1:1 addition product of Pt and hexafluoroplatinate (e.g. [Pt2F10]2– or analogous species)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the counter-ion or acid/base environment of A4 and the hydrolysis products observed for A5 to confirm their precise formulas.\nCoT agent sR5P, analyzing A1 decomposition, thinking: We know A1 is YF6 and decomposes at 293 K to A2 + F2.  Writing 2 YF6 → 2 YF5 + F2 gives A2 = YF5.  The mass fraction of F in YF5 is 5×19/(M(Y)+5×19)=0.3196, so M(YF5)=5×19/0.3196≈297 g·mol⁻¹.  Subtracting 5×19≈95 gives M(Y)≈202 g·mol⁻¹.; answer: Stoichiometry: 2 YF6 → 2 YF5 + F2 (A2 = YF5)\nMolecular weight of A2: M(YF5) = (5×19) / 0.3196 ≈ 297 g·mol⁻¹\nImplied atomic mass of Y: ≈202 g·mol⁻¹\nDebate agent Yf6I, round 0, analyzing A3 synthesis, thinking: Direct fluorination of Pt gives PtF4 (yellow-green solid) via Pt + 2 F2 → PtF4. A3’s ability to oxidize xenon (though less strongly than PtF6) and its synthesis route match Pt in the +4 oxidation state. This places A3 (PtF4, Pt(IV)) below A2 (PtF5, Pt(V)) and A1 (PtF6, Pt(VI)).; answer: A3 is PtF4 in the +4 oxidation state, related to A2 (PtF5, +5) and A1 (PtF6, +6).\nDebate agent qD2U, round 0, analyzing A3 synthesis, thinking: Element Y is platinum, and its binary fluorides are PtF2–PtF6. A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of Pt and also oxidizes xenon, so it must be PtF4, in which Pt is in the +4 oxidation state. A1 is PtF6 (Pt +6), A2 is PtF5 (Pt +5), and A3 is PtF4 (Pt +4), showing a stepwise series of oxidation states. PtF4 is less oxidizing than PtF6 but still strong enough to oxidize Xe.; answer: A3 is PtF4 with Pt in the +4 oxidation state; it is the +4 member of the series A3 (PtF4), A2 (PtF5), A1 (PtF6).\nDebate agent JW5A, round 0, analyzing A3 synthesis, thinking: Element Y is platinum, and its binary fluorides are PtF2–PtF6. A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of Pt, placing it at oxidation state +4. PtF4 can still oxidize xenon, though less strongly than PtF6. This situates A3 between A2 (PtF5, +5) and A1 (PtF6, +6) in terms of oxidation power and fluorine content.; answer: A3 is PtF4, with platinum in the +4 oxidation state, positioned between A2 (PtF5, +5) and A1 (PtF6, +6).\nDebate agent dXoP, round 0, analyzing A3 synthesis, thinking: Element Y is platinum. Direct fluorination of Pt yields PtF4, indicating Pt in the +4 oxidation state. A3 (PtF4) can oxidize xenon, consistent with a high‐oxidation‐state fluoride. A1 is PtF6 (Pt +6) which decomposes to A2 (PtF5, Pt +5) and F2. Thus A3 (PtF4) lies one oxidation level below A2 and two below A1 in the series of platinum fluorides.; answer: A3 is PtF4 with platinum in the +4 oxidation state, related to A2 (PtF5, +5) and A1 (PtF6, +6).\nFinal Decision agent, deciding on A3 formula, thinking: Element Y is platinum. Direct fluorination of Pt gives PtF4, which is known to oxidize xenon (though less strongly than PtF6). This places A3 in the +4 oxidation state and matches its synthesis route and reactivity relative to A1 (PtF6, +6) and A2 (PtF5, +5).; answer: A3 is PtF4 with platinum in the +4 oxidation state.\nReflexion CoT agent GoCx, analyzing A4 and A5, thinking: Element Y is Pt, so A4 is a hexafluoroplatinate salt in concentrated solution (e.g. H2PtF6 or K2PtF6). Reacting it 1:1 with Pt metal gives a mixed-valence platinum fluoride (likely the Pt2F11²⁻ anion, such as K2Pt2F11). On hydrolysis this would yield PtO2 and HF. However, without knowing the exact counter-ion of A4 and the precise hydrolysis products of A5 the stoichiometry cannot be pinned down.; answer: A4: hexafluoroplatinic acid (H2PtF6) or its salt (e.g. K2PtF6) in concentrated solution\nA5: mixed-valence fluoride anion Pt2F11²⁻ (e.g. K2Pt2F11), formed by reduction of PtF6⁻ by Pt\nIn water A5 hydrolyzes to PtO2 and HF\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the counter-ion of A4 and the observed hydrolysis products of A5 for precise formulas.\nCritic agent rQPx, feedback: The identification of A4 as hexafluoroplatinic acid (H2PtF6) or its salt and A5 as a mixed-valence Pt2F11^2– anion salt is chemically sound given Y = Pt. However, the answer remains incomplete because the exact counter-ion in A4 and the detailed hydrolysis products of A5 are not specified, preventing precise formula or mass determination.; correct: A4: hexafluoroplatinic acid, H2PtF6 (or its M2+ salt M2PtF6). A5: mixed-valence fluoride anion Pt2F11^2– (e.g. H2Pt2F11). On hydrolysis A5 yields PtO2 and HF. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the counter-ion of A4 and the exact hydrolysis products of A5 to determine the stoichiometry and molecular mass accurately.\nReflexion CoT agent GoCx, refining A4 and A5 analysis, thinking: Element Y is Pt, so A4 must be a hexafluoroplatinate in solution (e.g. H2PtF6 or K2PtF6). A 1:1 reaction with Pt metal yields a mixed‐valence Pt2F11²⁻ anion salt (A5). On hydrolysis A5 gives PtO2 and HF. However, without knowing the exact counter-ion of A4 and the detailed hydrolysis products of A5, the precise stoichiometry and molar mass cannot be pinned down.; answer: A4: hexafluoroplatinic acid (H2PtF6) or its salt (e.g. K2PtF6) in concentrated solution\nA5: mixed-valence platinum fluoride anion Pt2F11²⁻ (e.g. as K2Pt2F11)\nIn water A5 hydrolyzes to PtO2 and HF\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the counter-ion of A4 and the observed hydrolysis products of A5 to confirm exact formulas and stoichiometry.\nCoT agent F5OQ, calculating molecular weight range of A4, thinking: From Sub-task 4 we found YF₆ decomposes to YF₅, giving M(Y)≈202\u2009g·mol⁻¹.
