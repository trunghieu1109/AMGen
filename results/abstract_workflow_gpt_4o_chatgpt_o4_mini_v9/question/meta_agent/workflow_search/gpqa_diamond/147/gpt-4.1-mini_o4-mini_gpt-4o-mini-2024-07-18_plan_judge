Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_147
proposed answer: Based on identification of A4 as H₂YF₆ and using atomic masses (H ≈1.008, Y ≈202, F ≈19), its molar mass is approximately 2×1.008 + 202 + 6×19 ≈ 318 g/mol, which exceeds the highest provided interval (220–240 g/mol).

Answer:None of the given ranges
[TOO_HARD]
