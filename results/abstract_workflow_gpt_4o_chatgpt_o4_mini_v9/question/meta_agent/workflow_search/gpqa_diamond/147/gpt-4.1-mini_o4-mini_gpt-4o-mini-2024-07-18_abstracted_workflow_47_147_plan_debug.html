    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;220-240&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;140-160&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;160-180&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;110-130&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the calculated molecular weight range of A4, compare it with the given multiple-choice options: 220-240, 140-160, 160-180, 110-130, and select the correct range. Debate the reasoning and finalize the choice. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent oZzj:
Given that Y is Pt, A1 is PtF6 (MW≈309), A2 is PtF5 (MW≈291), A3 is PtF4 (MW≈271), A5 is PtF3 (MW≈252), the missing fluoride is PtF2 as A4 with MW = 195.08 (Pt) + 2×19.00 = ~233.08 g/mol. This falls squarely within the 220–240 g/mol range.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent QNmS:
Given Y is Pt and A4 corresponds to PtF2 with M≈195.08+2×19.00≈233.08 g/mol, this falls squarely in the 220–240 g/mol range. No other option matches.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Qzq6:
From sub-tasks, Y=Pt, A4=PtF2 with MW≈195.08+2×19.00=233.08 g/mol, which lies in the 220–240 range.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent o6ot:
A4 is PtF2 with M ≈ 195.08 + 2×19.00 = 233.08 g/mol, which lies within the 220–240 g/mol interval.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on molecular weight range of A4.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
