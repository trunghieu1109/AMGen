    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compare the identified NOESY cross-peak connected resonances with the given multiple-choice options to select the correct pair of resonances. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent GSZF:
The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the bridgehead 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm with the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, which corresponds to choice 2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent auJK:
The NOESY cross-peak connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, which corresponds to choice B.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 57Sk:
From Sub-task 5, the NOESY cross-peak connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm with the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. Among the choices, this matches choice 2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Thue:
The identified cross-peak connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, which corresponds to choice 2.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent GSZF:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent auJK:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 57Sk:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Thue:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on correct NOESY cross-peak connected resonances from choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
