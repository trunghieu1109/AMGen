Iterating gives [SCN⁻]≈0.0925 M, [Co²⁺]≈4.49×10⁻³ M, then [Co(SCN)⁺]≈3.74×10⁻³ M, [Co(SCN)₂]≈1.54×10⁻³ M, [Co(SCN)₃⁻]≈2.24×10⁻⁴ M, [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]≈5.3×10⁻⁶ M, which sum to 1.00×10⁻² M. The dithiocyanato complex thus comprises (1.54×10⁻³/1.00×10⁻²)×100≈15.4%.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent KWLT:\nTo find [Co(SCN)₂] exactly, we must solve both the cobalt mass‐balance and the SCN⁻ mass‐balance simultaneously. That yields a nonlinear equation for [SCN⁻]_free, which goes beyond simple algebraic substitution. Our approximation using [SCN⁻]_free≈0.08 M gave [Co(SCN)₂]≈0.001275 M, i.e. 12.75% of total Co.

However, adjusting [SCN–] for binding yields ≈12–15%, not matching any choice.

Since βn=[Co(SCN)n]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]ⁿ), we directly express each complex concentration in terms of free Co²⁺ and SCN⁻.; answer: [Co(SCN)+] = β1·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻] = 9·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]\n[Co(SCN)2] = β2·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]² = 40·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]²\n[Co(SCN)3⁻] = β3·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]³ = 63·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]³\n[Co(SCN)4²⁻] = β4·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]⁴\nCoT-SC agent pUTw, generating equilibrium expressions, thinking: The stability constants βn define the overall formation equilibria: βn = [Co(SCN)n]/([Co2+][SCN–]^n).

This depletes free SCN by ~20%, so [SCN–]free falls to ≈0.08 M. The depletion is significant and will affect complex distribution; thus [SCN–] cannot be treated as constant at 0.10 M.; answer: The free SCN– concentration must be adjusted (approx.
