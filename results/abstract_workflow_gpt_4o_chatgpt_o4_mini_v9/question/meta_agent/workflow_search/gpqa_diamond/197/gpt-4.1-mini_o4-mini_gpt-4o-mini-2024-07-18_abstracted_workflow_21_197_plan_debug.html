    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Based on the outputs from Sub-tasks 3 and 4, solve the system of equations to compute concentrations of each cobalt(II) thiocyanato complex species. Then calculate the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (with two SCN- ligands) relative to total cobalt concentration. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent SewH:
We approximate the free SCN– from the SCN mass‐balance and the Co mass‐balance, then compute [Co²⁺] and each complex via [Co(SCN)_n]=β_n[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n. Iterating gives [SCN⁻]≈0.0925 M, [Co²⁺]≈4.49×10⁻³ M, then [Co(SCN)⁺]≈3.74×10⁻³ M, [Co(SCN)₂]≈1.54×10⁻³ M, [Co(SCN)₃⁻]≈2.24×10⁻⁴ M, [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]≈5.3×10⁻⁶ M, which sum to 1.00×10⁻² M. The dithiocyanato complex thus comprises (1.54×10⁻³/1.00×10⁻²)×100≈15.4%.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent KWLT:
To find [Co(SCN)₂] exactly, we must solve both the cobalt mass‐balance and the SCN⁻ mass‐balance simultaneously. That yields a nonlinear equation for [SCN⁻]_free, which goes beyond simple algebraic substitution. Our approximation using [SCN⁻]_free≈0.08 M gave [Co(SCN)₂]≈0.001275 M, i.e. 12.75% of total Co. However, this doesn’t match any provided choice, indicating a more accurate numerical solution is required.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent OqdH:
Using the mass‐balance expression from Sub‐task 3 with [SCN⁻]free≈0.08 M (Sub‐task 4), we compute
Denominator D=1+9·0.08+40·0.08²+63·0.08³+16·0.08⁴≈2.009
[Co²⁺]=0.01/D≈0.0049776 M
[Co(SCN)⁺]=9·[Co²⁺]·0.08≈0.0035839 M
[Co(SCN)₂]=40·[Co²⁺]·0.08²≈0.0012743 M
[Co(SCN)₃⁻]=63·[Co²⁺]·0.08³≈0.0001605 M
[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]=16·[Co²⁺]·0.08⁴≈0.00000326 M
Check sum≈0.01 M. Percentage of the dithiocyanato complex =0.0012743/0.01≈12.7%.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent LSAm:
Using [SCN–]≈0.10 M (ignoring depletion) gives [Co(SCN)2]=β2[Co2+][SCN–]^2≈0.001692 M, which is 16.9% of total Co. However, adjusting [SCN–] for binding yields ≈12–15%, not matching any choice. This suggests the free‐SCN– must be solved via the full SCN mass‐balance.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent SewH:
[Co²⁺]=4.49×10⁻³ M; [Co(SCN)⁺]=3.74×10⁻³ M; [Co(SCN)₂]=1.54×10⁻³ M; [Co(SCN)₃⁻]=2.24×10⁻⁴ M; [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]=5.3×10⁻⁶ M; % Co(SCN)₂≈15.4%

[TOO_HARD]  
Solve the SCN⁻ mass‐balance (Σ n·[Co(SCN)ₙ] + [SCN⁻] = 0.10 M) and cobalt mass‐balance together—e.g. via Newton–Raphson—to get the exact percentage.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent OqdH:
[Co²⁺]=4.9776×10⁻³ M; [Co(SCN)⁺]=3.5839×10⁻³ M; [Co(SCN)₂]=1.2743×10⁻³ M; [Co(SCN)₃⁻]=1.605×10⁻⁴ M; [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]=3.263×10⁻⁶ M; percentage of Co(SCN)₂=12.7%

### answer #1 by Debate Agent LSAm:
A)
[TOO_HARD]
Please confirm whether to solve the full SCN– mass‐balance (0.1 M = [SCN–] + ∑n·[Co(SCN)n]) for [SCN–]free before computing the complex fractions.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The exact computation requires solving the full SCN⁻ mass‐balance, giving ~12–15%, but none of those match the provided choices. The only available option closest to a reasonable estimate is 16.9%, corresponding to ignoring SCN depletion and using [SCN–]≈0.10 M.
