Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_197
proposed answer: The exact computation requires solving the full SCN⁻ mass‐balance, giving ~12–15%, but none of those match the provided choices. The only available option closest to a reasonable estimate is 16.9%, corresponding to ignoring SCN depletion and using [SCN–]≈0.10 M.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_197
proposed answer: Summing free Co(II) and its SCN− complexes gives total [Co] ≃1.00×10^−2 M. The dithiocyanato species [Co(SCN)₂] ≃1.69×10^−3 M, so its fraction is (1.69×10^−3/1.00×10^−2)×100%≃16.9%.
