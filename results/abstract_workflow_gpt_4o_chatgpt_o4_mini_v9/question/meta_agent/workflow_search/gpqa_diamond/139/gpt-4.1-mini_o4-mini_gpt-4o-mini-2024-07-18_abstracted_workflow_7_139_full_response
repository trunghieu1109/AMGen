Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron, so D2 has equal numbers of protons and neutrons.; answer: The gas W is deuterium gas (D2).\nCoT-SC agent wRW1, identifying gas W, thinking: Substance X is LiAlD4, which reacts with water to liberate D2 gas. Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron, so the D2 molecule contains an equal number of protons and neutrons.; answer: D2\nCoT-SC agent ndvr, identifying gas W, thinking: Substance X is LiAlD4 reacting with water. The reaction releases D2 gas. Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron, so D2 fits the clue of equal numbers of protons and neutrons.; answer: Gas W is deuterium (D2).\nCoT agent a7WF, identifying precipitate G and analyzing decomposition, thinking: Substance X is LiAlD4 reacting with H2O to produce D2 gas and Al(OD)3 precipitate. Heating Al(OD)3 yields D2O (heavy water), whose melting point is about 277 K.; answer: Precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)3. Upon thermal decomposition it releases heavy water, D2O, which melts near 277 K.\nCoT agent 6DZq, analyzing keto acid reaction product, thinking: The question asks for Sub-task 5: analyze the product formed when LiAlD4 (Substance X) reacts with a keto acid. A common keto acid is pyruvic acid (CH3–CO–COOH). LiAlD4 delivers deuteride to the carbonyl carbon, reducing the keto (=O) to an –OD (alcohol) while leaving the carboxyl group intact. That yields lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms Substance X behaves as a deuteride donor analogue of LiAlH4.; answer: The reaction of LiAlD4 with pyruvic acid (a keto acid) reduces the keto carbonyl to an alcohol, yielding lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), which contains two oxygen atoms.\nReflexion CoT agent kEKd, determining isotopes, thinking: Sub-task 1 identified Substance X as LiAlD₄, the deuteride analog of LiAlH₄. The heavier isotope is deuterium (²H). The compound contains lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), and deuterium (²H) exclusively. Li and Al are in their natural major isotopic forms (^7Li and ^27Al). There are no protium atoms in LiAlD₄.; answer: Constituent elements and isotopes in Substance X: lithium (^7Li), aluminum (^27Al), and deuterium (^2H)\nCritic agent wWGw, feedback on isotope identification, thinking: The assignment of Substance X as LiAlD₄ is coherent: it correctly identifies deuterium (²H) as the heavier hydrogen isotope and includes lithium and aluminum, typically in their major stable isotopes (^7Li and ^27Al). Limitations stem from missing data on isotopic purity and natural abundance—particularly for lithium (which has both ^6Li and ^7Li) and any trace aluminum radioisotopes. No analytical confirmation (e.g., mass spectrometry) is provided to rule out minor isotopic variants.; answer: Identified isotopes: ^7Li, ^27Al, ^2H\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide isotopic abundance data or spectrometric analyses to confirm the exact isotopic composition.\nReflexion CoT agent kEKd, refining isotope identification, thinking: Sub-task 6 builds on identification of LiAlD₄ (Substance X). The heavier hydrogen isotope is deuterium (^2H). Lithium in a commercial reagent is natural Li (≈92.5% ^7Li, ≈7.5% ^6Li). Aluminum is nearly all ^27Al. No data on trace radioisotopes is given. Thus the constituent isotopes are ^2H, ^6Li, ^7Li, and ^27Al.; answer: Constituent isotopes in Substance X: deuterium (^2H), lithium (^7Li major, ^6Li minor), and aluminum (^27Al)\nCoT agent JHh1, selecting lightest and heaviest elements, thinking: The identified isotopes are ^2H (hydrogen), ^6Li/^7Li (lithium), and ^27Al (aluminum). The elements present are therefore H, Li, and Al. Hydrogen is the lightest element and aluminum is the heaviest.; answer: Lightest element: Hydrogen; Heaviest element: Aluminum\nCoT agent nBKv, calculating cumulative atomic masses, thinking: The isotopes identified for hydrogen are ^1H and the heavier ^2H (deuterium), giving a total mass of 1\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20093. For aluminum only ^27Al was identified, so its cumulative mass is 27.; answer: Lightest element cumulative mass: 3; Heaviest element cumulative mass: 27.\nDebate agent 64Fl, round 0, comparing cumulative masses and selecting answer, thinking: We calculated the cumulative masses for the lightest element (1H + 2H = 3) and the heaviest identified (27Al = 27), giving a total of 30, which does not match any of the provided options.
