    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;29&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;25&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;35&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;31&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent K6yb:
Substance X is LiAlD₄, containing four deuterium atoms (²H, each 2 u) and one aluminum atom (²⁷Al, 27 u). Summing the masses of all deuterium atoms gives 4×2 u = 8 u (lightest). The single aluminum atom contributes 27 u (heaviest).

### answer by Final Decision Agent K6yb:
Lightest cumulative mass = 8 u; Heaviest cumulative mass = 27 u

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated cumulative atomic mass with the provided multiple-choice options (29, 25, 35, 31) and select the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
