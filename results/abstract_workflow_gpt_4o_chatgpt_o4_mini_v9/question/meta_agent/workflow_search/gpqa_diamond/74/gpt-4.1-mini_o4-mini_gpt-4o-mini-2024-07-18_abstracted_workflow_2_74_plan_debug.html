    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene&#39;s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5&#39;ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3&#39;\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ribosome terminated the translation early&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Integrate findings from Sub-tasks 3, 4, 5, and 6 to determine the most likely cause of the failure to overexpress the protein. Debate the possible explanations and select the correct explanation among the provided choices: 1) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain, 2) The ribosome terminated the translation early, 3) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation, 4) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent JmhE:
The translated sequence contains a TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag and lysine, causing premature termination. There are no missense mutations in the tag, no evidence that missing linker causes proteolysis, and stop codons are handled by release factors, not tRNAs.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mycA:
Integration of sub-task results shows the HA tag is correct with no missense mutations, and there is an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the tag causing premature termination. Lack of a linker or tRNA availability are not supported by the sequence data. Thus the ribosome terminated translation early.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent xCYN:
Sub-tasks 3 and 4 revealed that the HA tag sequence is correct but there is an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the tag, causing premature termination. Sub-task 5 found no evidence that lack of a linker causes proteolysis, and sub-task 6 confirmed that stop codons are handled by release factors, not missing tRNAs. Thus the most likely cause is early termination by the ribosome.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ubiF:
Integration of sub-task findings shows no missense mutation in the HA tag (sub-task 3), presence of an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the tag truncating translation (sub-tasks 4 and 6), and no evidence that lack of linker causes proteolysis (sub-task 5). The most likely cause is premature termination of translation.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on the most likely cause of failure to overexpress the protein and select the correct explanation among the provided choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The DNA sequence includes an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag coding region, causing premature termination of translation. There’s no evidence of a missense mutation in the HA epitope, missing linker proteolysis, or a missing tRNA for UAA. Thus the ribosome terminates translation early.
