    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene&#39;s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5&#39;ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3&#39;\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ribosome terminated the translation early&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse&#39;}.

### Sub-task 8: Based on the integrated analysis, select the correct explanation from the provided choices regarding why the protein overexpression failed. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ZiTx:
Integration of translation analysis revealed an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag causing premature termination.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent I1UO:
The construct’s plus strand contains an in-frame TGA codon immediately after the HA tag sequence, causing eukaryotic release factors to recognize it as a stop codon and terminate translation prematurely. This explains the failure to overexpress the full-length protein.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 7Ab7:
Sequence analysis revealed an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, which would recruit eukaryotic release factors and terminate translation prematurely, preventing full‐length protein expression.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent zLZW:
Translation analysis revealed an in‐frame UGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag sequence, causing premature termination of translation and preventing full‐length protein expression.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ZiTx:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent I1UO:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 7Ab7:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent zLZW:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Make final decision on the correct explanation for protein overexpression failure.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
