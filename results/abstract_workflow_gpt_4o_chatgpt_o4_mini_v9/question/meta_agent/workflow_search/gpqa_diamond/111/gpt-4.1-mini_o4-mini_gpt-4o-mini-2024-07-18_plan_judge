Question: Example(question='Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>, where |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. ', choice1='0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice2='0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice3='0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)', choice4='0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We have |α⟩ = 1/√7[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2−i)|down⟩] and A = (ħ/2)σ_x. Applying σ_x swaps components. Then ⟨σ_x⟩ = v†σ_xv = [(1−i)(2−i)+(2+i)(1+i)]/7 = 2/7. Thus ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2)*(2/7) = ħ/7.

Answer:ħ/7
