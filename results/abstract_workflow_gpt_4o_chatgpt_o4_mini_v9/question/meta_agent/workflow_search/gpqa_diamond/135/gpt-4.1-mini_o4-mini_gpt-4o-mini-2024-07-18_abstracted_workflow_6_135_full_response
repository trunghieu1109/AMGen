We identify the radial unit vector ê_r, note the only nonzero component f_r=1/r², and that the field is undefined at the origin (r=0).; answer: The vector field is f⃗(r)= (1/r²)\u2009ê_r, where ê_r is the outward radial unit vector. In spherical components: f_r=1/r², f_θ=0, f_φ=0. The domain is all space except the origin (r>0 in ℝ³).\nCoT-SC agent 16dS, computing divergence, thinking: We use the spherical‐coordinate divergence formula for a purely radial field f_r(r): ∇·f = (1/r^2) ∂[r^2 f_r]/∂r. Here f_r=1/r^2 so r^2 f_r=1, whose derivative w.r.t. r is zero.; answer: ∇·f = 1/r^2 · d(1)/dr = 0 for all r>0\nCoT-SC agent oy5w, computing divergence, thinking: We apply the spherical‐coordinate divergence formula for a purely radial field f_r(r): ∇·f = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r [r^2 f_r]. Here f_r=1/r^2, so r^2 f_r=1, whose derivative is zero. Thus ∇·f=0 everywhere in the domain (r>0).; answer: ∇·f(r)=0 for all r>0\nCoT-SC agent IQWG, computing divergence, thinking: We use the spherical‐coordinate divergence formula for a purely radial field f⃗(r)=f_r(r)ê_r: ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr[r²f_r(r)]. Here f_r=1/r², so r²f_r=1, whose derivative is zero. Hence ∇·f=0 everywhere away from the origin.; answer: ∇·f = 0 for all r>0.\nReflexion CoT agent tl3E, analyzing divergence behavior, thinking: Sub-task 2 gave ∇·f=0 for all r>0, but the field is singular at r=0. A 1/r² radial field has a point source at the origin that must be handled via distributions. By Gauss’s theorem the total flux through a sphere of radius R is ∮f·dA=4π, so the volume integral of ∇·f over the ball equals 4π. This implies ∇·f=4π\u2009δ³(r).; answer: For 0<r≤R, ∇·f=0, but at r=0 there is a delta‐function singularity: ∇·f=4π\u2009δ³(r). Hence ∫_{|r|≤R}∇·f\u2009dV=4π.\nCritic agent SZyN, feedback on divergence behavior, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies that ∇·f=0 for r>0 and that the entire contribution arises from a δ-function at the origin, yielding ∫∇·f\u2009dV=4 π. A key limitation is the need to invoke distribution theory (or exclude a small ball around r=0) since the field is not C¹ at the origin, and the standard divergence theorem requires a nonsingular region or careful limiting procedure.; answer: 4 π\nReflexion CoT agent tl3E, refining divergence behavior analysis, thinking: From Sub-task 2 we know ∇·f(r)=0 for all r>0. However, f has a 1/r² singularity at the origin, so the divergence theorem applied to the ball |r|≤R must account for a point‐source term. By computing the flux ∮_S f·dA over a sphere of radius R (which equals 4π), we infer that all divergence is concentrated at r=0. In distribution form, ∇·f=4π\u2009δ³(r), and hence ∫_{|r|≤R}∇·f\u2009dV=4π. This relies on treating the origin via a limiting procedure (excluding a small ball around r=0 and then letting its radius→0).; answer: For 0<r≤R, ∇·f(r)=0, but at the origin the field has a delta‐function singularity: ∇·f(r)=4π\u2009δ³(r). Consequently, the volume integral over the sphere of radius R is ∫_{|r|≤R}∇·f\u2009dV=4π. This result follows from evaluating the flux through the spherical surface and invoking distributions to handle the singularity at r=0.\nCoT agent O1ci, applying divergence theorem, thinking: By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f over the ball of radius R equals the outward flux of f through its surface. Since f(r)=r̂/r², the surface integral is ∮_|r|=R f·dA = (1/R²)·(4πR²)=4π, so ∫_V ∇·f\u2009dV=4π.; answer: ∫_{|r|≤R} ∇·f\u2009dV = ∮_{|r|=R} f·dA = 4π\nCoT-SC agent TqrL, evaluating surface integral, thinking: By symmetry, f= r̂/r² is constant magnitude 1/R² on the sphere of radius R. The surface area is 4πR², so ∮ f·dA = (1/R²)×4πR² = 4π.; answer: Total flux through the sphere of radius R is 4π.\nCoT-SC agent ZAkU, evaluating surface integral, thinking: On the sphere |r|=R, f = r̂/R² and dA = R²\u2009sinθ\u2009dθ\u2009dφ\u2009r̂, so f·dA = (1/R²)(R²\u2009sinθ\u2009dθ\u2009dφ) = sinθ\u2009dθ\u2009dφ.
