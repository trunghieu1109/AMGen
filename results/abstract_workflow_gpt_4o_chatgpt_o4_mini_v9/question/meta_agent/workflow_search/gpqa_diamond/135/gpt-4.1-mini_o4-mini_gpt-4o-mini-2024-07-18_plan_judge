Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_135
proposed answer: The divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin where the 1/r^2 singularity contributes a net point-source strength of 4π, matching the surface flux. Hence the volume integral equals 4π, corresponding to choice B).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_135
proposed answer: By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere equals the surface flux ∮f·dA. For f = r̂/r², the flux is ∫0^{2π}∫0^π (1/R²)(R² sinθ) dθ dφ = 4π, independent of R. Among the choices, this corresponds to 4π (choice B).
