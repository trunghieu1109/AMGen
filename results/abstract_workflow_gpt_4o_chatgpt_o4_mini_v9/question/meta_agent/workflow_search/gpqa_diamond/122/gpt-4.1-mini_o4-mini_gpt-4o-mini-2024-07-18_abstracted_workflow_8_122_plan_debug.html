    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 880 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 000 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 060 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 940 000 km.&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Using the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy frame (from Sub-task 2) and the time interval in the Galaxy frame (from Sub-task 4), calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame during that time. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent E0Z5:
From Sub-task 2: v = 60,000 km/s. From Sub-task 4: t = γ·τ ≈ 1.0206×50 s ≈ 51.03 s. Distance d = v·t = 60,000 km/s × 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km, which rounds to ≈3.06×10^6 km.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent vBjg:
Using v = 60 000 km/s and t = γ·τ ≈ 1.0206·50 s ≈ 51.03 s, the distance is d = v·t ≈ 60 000 km/s × 51.03 s ≈ 3.0618×10^6 km, which matches choice C.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent E0Z5:
3.06×10^6 km

### answer #1 by Debate Agent vBjg:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
