This requires extracting velocities, time intervals, frames, and assumptions.; answer: List of given data and conditions:\n- A supernova ejecta part is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy.\n- From the ejecta reference frame, the Galactic center moves towards the ejecta at v = 60 000 km/s.\n- Proper time interval measured in the ejecta frame: Δτ = 50 s.\n- Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames (no acceleration).\n- Neglect gravity, Galactic rotation, and Galactic revolution effects.\n- The goal is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame during the 50 s proper time interval.\nCoT-SC agent irxV, clarifying relative velocity, thinking: We need to explain that the quoted speed is the relative speed between two inertial frames and that in special relativity the speed of A relative to B has the same magnitude (opposite direction) as B relative to A. Here v=60 000 km/s is the speed of the Galactic center toward the ejecta in the ejecta frame, so in the Galaxy frame the ejecta moves toward the center at the same speed.; answer: The given 60 000 km/s is the relative speed between the two inertial frames: in the ejecta frame, the Galactic center approaches at 60 000 km/s. By symmetry of inertial frames, in the Galaxy frame the ejecta travels toward the Galactic center at v = 60 000 km/s.\nCoT-SC agent NDkz, clarifying relative velocity, thinking: We need to explain that the 60,000 km/s is simply the relative speed between the two inertial frames, and by the principle of relativity the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame has the same magnitude but opposite direction. No further information is needed, since only one relative velocity is given.; answer: The 60 000 km/s is the relative speed of the Galactic center as measured in the ejecta frame. By symmetry of inertial frames, in the Galaxy frame the ejecta moves at 60 000 km/s toward the Galactic center (same magnitude, opposite direction).\nCoT-SC agent RHLZ, clarifying relative velocity, thinking: The 60 000 km/s is the relative speed between the two inertial frames as measured in the ejecta frame. By the principle of relativity, if in the ejecta frame the Galactic center approaches at +60 000 km/s, then in the Galaxy frame the ejecta recedes (moves) toward the Galactic center at 60 000 km/s (opposite direction). No further velocity‐addition is needed since only two frames are involved.; answer: The given 60 000 km/s is the relative speed between frames. In the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves toward the Galactic center at 60 000 km/s.\nCoT agent QzqL, calculating Lorentz factor gamma, thinking: We compute β = v/c = 60000\u2009km/s ÷ 300000\u2009km/s = 0.2. Then γ = 1/√(1−β²) = 1/√(1−0.04) ≈ 1/√0.96 ≈ 1.0206.; answer: γ = 1/√(1−(0.2)²) ≈ 1.0206\nCoT agent sEbF, converting proper time to Galaxy frame time, thinking: Time dilation: t = γ·τ = 1.0206 × 50\u2009s ≈ 51.03\u2009s.; answer: ≈ 51.03 seconds\nDebate agent E0Z5, round 0, calculating distance traveled, thinking: From Sub-task 2: v = 60,000 km/s.
