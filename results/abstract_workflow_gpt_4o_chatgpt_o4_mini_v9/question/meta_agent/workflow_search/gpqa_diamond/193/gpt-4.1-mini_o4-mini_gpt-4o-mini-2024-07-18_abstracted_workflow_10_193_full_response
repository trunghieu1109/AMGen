Comparing with the choices: choice1 is 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{−Jβ}, which matches exactly in both coefficients (2 and 6) and exponents (+3Jβ and −Jβ). The other options have different exponents or coefficients.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent H8ut:\nThe computed partition function is Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}. Scanning the options: choice1 is Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}, which exactly matches both coefficients (2 and 6) and exponents (3Jβ and −Jβ). The other choices have different exponent factors or swapped coefficients, so they do not match.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent GDjE:\nThe computed Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ} matches choice1 exactly in both coefficients and exponents: two configurations contribute e^{3Jβ}, six contribute e^{-Jβ}.
