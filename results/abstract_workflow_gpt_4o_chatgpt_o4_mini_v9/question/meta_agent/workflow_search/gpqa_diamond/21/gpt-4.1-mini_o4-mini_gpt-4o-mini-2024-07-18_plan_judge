Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_21
proposed answer: The integrated conclusion from Sub-task 5 was that oxygen is thermodynamically a weaker oxidant in basic solutions and kinetically reacts more slowly in acidic solutions, matching choice 3 (‘weaker – slower’), which corresponds to option C.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_21
proposed answer: Based on standard reduction potentials (0.401 V in base vs. 1.229 V in acid), O₂ is thermodynamically a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, O₂ reduction is sluggish (slow) in acidic media. Therefore the correct combination is “weaker – slower,” corresponding to choice C.
