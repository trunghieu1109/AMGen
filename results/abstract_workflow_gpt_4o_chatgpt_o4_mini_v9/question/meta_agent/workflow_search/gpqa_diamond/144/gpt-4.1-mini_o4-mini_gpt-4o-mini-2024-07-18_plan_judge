Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_144
proposed answer: The final calculated number of stereoisomers is 16, which matches choice2 among the provided options (4, 8, 16, 32). Therefore, the correct answer is B).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_144
proposed answer: The initial calculation of 2^6=64 stereoisomers doesnâ€™t match any options. Noting there are actually only four stereogenic elements (two chiral centers and two C=C bonds), the count is 2^4=16. This aligns with choice 16.

Answer:B)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide a detailed structural diagram or step-by-step stereocenter and alkene configuration assignment to confirm potential meso forms or internal symmetry that may reduce the count.
