All necessary elements are provided, so no additional information is needed.; answer: P = [[0, 1/√2, 0]; [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]; [0, 1/√2, 0]]\nQ = [[1, 0, 0]; [0, 0, 0]; [0, 0, -1]]\nCoT agent g3wG, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, thinking: To find eigenvalues of P, compute det(P - λI). With a = 1/√2, the characteristic polynomial is λ(1 - λ^2)=0, giving eigenvalues λ = 1, 0, -1. For λ=0, solve P v = 0: a y = 0 ⇒ y=0 and a(x+z)=0 ⇒ x = -z. Thus the eigenvector for λ=0 is v₀ ∝ (1,0,-1). Normalizing gives (1/√2)(1,0,-1).; answer: Eigenvalues of P: 1, 0, -1. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v₀> = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]ᵀ.\nCoT agent 6uXS, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Q, thinking: Operator Q is diagonal with entries (1,0,−1) on the diagonal, so its eigenvalues are immediately the diagonal entries and the normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.; answer: Eigenvalues: 1, 0, −1. Corresponding normalized eigenvectors: for 1 → (1,0,0)^T; for 0 → (0,1,0)^T; for −1 → (0,0,1)^T. The eigenstate for eigenvalue −1 is (0,0,1)^T.\nCoT agent xt4I, projecting initial state onto eigenspace of P eigenvalue 0, thinking: To project the normalized state |ψ⟩ = (−1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6) onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0, we compute the inner product with the normalized eigenvector |v₀⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, −1). The overlap is ⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)((−1/√6)·1 + (1/√6)(−1)) = −1/√3. Multiplying this amplitude by |v₀⟩ gives (−1/√3)(1/√2)(1, 0, −1) ∝ (−1/√6, 0, 1/√6), which up to an overall phase is just |v₀⟩ again.; answer: The post-measurement state after measuring P and obtaining 0 is the normalized eigenvector |v₀⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, −1)ᵀ (global phase irrelevant).\nCoT agent Tb4F, normalizing post-measurement state after P=0, thinking: The eigenvector |v₀⟩ = (1/√2)(1,0,−1) already has norm squared = (1/2)(1^2+0^2+1^2)=1, so it is normalized.; answer: The normalized post-measurement state is (1/√2)(1, 0, −1)ᵀ.\nCoT agent yMp4, calculating probability of P=0, thinking: The normalized initial state is |ψ> = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6) and the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0 is |v₀> = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1). The projection amplitude is ⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)[(-1/√6) + (0) + (-1/√6)] = -2/(√2√6) = -1/√3, so the probability is |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = 1/3.; answer: 1/3\nCoT agent XGxV, calculating probability of Q=-1 after P=0, thinking: We have the normalized post-P measurement state |ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(1,0,−1)^T.
