{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Compare the calculated relative velocity and total energy values with the given choices to determine the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent PeXi:
The relativistic relative velocity is 0.14c and the total energy sums to ≈5.96 m c², matching choice 1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent hnkl:
The calculated relative velocity is 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c^2, which matches choice1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mH1G:
We found the relative velocity to be 0.14c and the total energy to be approximately 5.96 m c², which matches choice1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent OW9r:
Calculated relative velocity u≈0.14c and total energy E≈5.96 mc². Comparing with choices, only choice1 matches these values.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent PeXi:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent hnkl:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent mH1G:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct choice of relative velocity and total energy.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
