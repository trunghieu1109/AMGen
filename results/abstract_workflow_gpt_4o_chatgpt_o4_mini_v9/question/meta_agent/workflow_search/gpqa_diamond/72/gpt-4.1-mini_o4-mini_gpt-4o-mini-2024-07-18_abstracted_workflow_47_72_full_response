This is standard special-relativity.; answer: The relativistic velocity addition formula for finding the speed of one astronaut relative to the other (both moving along +x) is:\n\nu = (v2 – v1) / (1 – v1·v2 / c²)\n\nwhere v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c are their speeds in the lab frame and c is the speed of light.\nCoT agent sPb5, calculating relative velocity, thinking: We use the relativistic velocity addition formula for two objects moving in the same direction: u = (v1 – v2)/(1 – v1·v2/c²). Here v1 = 0.6c (mass 2m), v2 = 0.5c (mass 3m). Plugging in: u = (0.6c – 0.5c)/(1 – 0.6·0.5) = 0.1c/0.7 ≈ 0.1429c ≈ 0.14c.; answer: 0.14c\nCoT agent tGmq, calculating total energy, thinking: We compute the Lorentz factor for each astronaut: γ1=1/√(1–0.6²)=1.25, γ2=1/√(1–0.5²)≈1.1547.
