Here u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c. I plug in and simplify.; answer: Step 1: Write formula: v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c^2).\nStep 2: Substitute values: v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.6*0.5).\nStep 3: Compute numerator: 0.1c.

Plugging in β1=0.6 and β2=0.5 gives the numerical values.; answer: For the first astronaut (v=0.6c):\n1. Compute β₁=v/c=0.6\n2. Compute 1−β₁²=1−(0.6)²=1−0.36=0.64\n3. γ₁=1/√0.64=1/0.8=1.25\n\nFor the second astronaut (v=0.5c):\n1. Compute β₂=v/c=0.5\n2.

From Sub-task 2 we have γ1 = 1.25 for v=0.6c and γ2 ≈1.1547 for v=0.5c. The first astronaut has mass 2m, so E1 = 1.25 × 2m c^2 = 2.5 m c^2. The second astronaut has mass 3m, so E2 ≈1.1547 × 3m c^2 ≈3.4641 m c^2.; answer: Astronaut 1: E1 = γ1×2m c^2 = 1.25×2m c^2 = 2.5 m c^2\nAstronaut 2: E2 = γ2×3m c^2 ≈ 1.1547×3m c^2 ≈ 3.4641 m c^2\nCoT-SC agent H0vs, calculating total energies, thinking: We use E = γ m_total c^2 for each astronaut. From Sub-task 2, γ1 = 1.25 and γ2 ≈ 1.1547. The first astronaut has mass 2m, so E1 = γ1 × (2m) c^2 = 1.25 × 2m c^2 = 2.5 m c^2. The second astronaut has mass 3m, so E2 = γ2 × (3m) c^2 ≈ 1.1547 × 3m c^2 ≈ 3.4641 m c^2.; answer: Astronaut 1: E1 = 2.5 m c^2\nAstronaut 2: E2 ≈ 3.4641 m c^2\nCoT-SC agent TaSx, calculating total energies, thinking: We use E=γ m c². From Sub-task 2, γ₁=1.25, γ₂≈1.1547. Masses are m₁=2m, m₂=3m. So E₁=1.25·2m·c²=2.5\u2009m\u2009c²; E₂≈1.1547·3m·c²≈3.4641\u2009m\u2009c². The information is sufficient.; answer: Astronaut 1: E₁ = γ₁\u2009m₁\u2009c² = 1.25 × (2m)\u2009c² = 2.5\u2009m\u2009c²\nAstronaut 2: E₂ = γ₂\u2009m₂\u2009c² ≈ 1.1547 × (3m)\u2009c² ≈ 3.4641\u2009m\u2009c²\n\nDetailed reasoning:\n1. For v=0.6c, γ₁=1.25; m₁=2m ⇒ E₁=1.25·2m·c²=2.5m\u2009c².\n2.

Summing these gives the total system energy. No information is missing and the question is straightforward.; answer: Sub-task 4: The total energy of the system is\ne1 + e2 = 2.5\u2009m\u2009c^2 + 3.4641\u2009m\u2009c^2 ≈ 5.9641\u2009m\u2009c^2.
