Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: FTIR shows a broad O–H and strong C=O consistent with all four candidates, so none are eliminated. The NMR splitting patterns—a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets—require one CH bearing a methyl and an ethyl and another CH bearing two ethyls, matching only CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

proposed answer: The IR confirms a carboxylic acid (broad O–H around 3000 cm⁻¹, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹). The ¹H NMR shows two distinct methine signals: one split as a doublet of triplets of quartets (adjacent to a CH, CH₂, and CH₃) and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets (adjacent to one CH and two CH₂s). Only CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (choice3) provides that exact combination of neighbors. The next best match is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (choice4), followed by the two all‐methyl variants (choices2 and 1).

Answer:1. choice3 (CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH)
2. choice4 (CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH)
3. choice2 (CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH)
4. choice1 (CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH)
Most likely: choice3
Extracted answer: 1. choice3 (CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH)
