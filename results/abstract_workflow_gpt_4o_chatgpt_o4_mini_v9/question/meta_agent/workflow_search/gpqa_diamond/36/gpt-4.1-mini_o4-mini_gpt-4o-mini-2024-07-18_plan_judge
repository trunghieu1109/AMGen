Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_36
proposed answer: The final Wittig product E is CH(Et)2–CH=CH–CH(Et)–CH3, with two ethyl substituents on one vinylic carbon (equivalent by free rotation) and a sec-butyl substituent on the other. Listing unique carbons: the two vinylic CHs (2), the diethyl CH2 (1) and CH3 (1), and the sec-butyl CH (1), CH2 (1), and two distinct CH3 groups (2) gives 2+1+1+1+1+2 = 8 distinct 13C environments. Choice C) corresponds to 8 signals.
