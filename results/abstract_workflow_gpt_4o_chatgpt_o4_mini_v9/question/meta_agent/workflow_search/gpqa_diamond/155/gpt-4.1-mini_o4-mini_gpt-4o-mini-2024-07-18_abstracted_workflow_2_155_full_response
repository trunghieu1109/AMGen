This requires identifying E vs Z geometry, noting substituents (propyl and butyl), and predicting that E gives enantiomers and Z gives a meso product.; answer: Sub-task 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans (opposite-side) internal alkene bearing a propyl and a butyl group on each double-bonded carbon; its two faces are enantiotopic, so epoxidation gives a racemic pair of chiral epoxides. (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis (same-side) internal alkene with the same substituents; its syn epoxidation produces a single meso epoxide due to an internal plane of symmetry.\nCoT agent PnPU, analyzing reagent and conditions, thinking: mCPBA is a peroxyacid that delivers an oxygen atom across a C=C in a concerted syn fashion, preserving the relative configuration of the alkene. Thus epoxidation is stereospecific: an E-alkene gives a trans epoxide, a Z-alkene gives a cis epoxide. Under aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens by anti addition of water to give a vicinal diol with trans stereochemistry. Because the (E) epoxide is a pair of enantiomers, its diol is a racemic mixture. The (Z) epoxide has an internal plane of symmetry (meso) so its diol is a single meso compound.; answer: Sub-task 2 Answer:\n• mCPBA effects stereospecific syn epoxidation: E-alkene → trans epoxide (racemic), Z-alkene → cis epoxide (meso).\n• Aqueous acid opens the epoxide by anti addition of water to give a trans-diol.\n• Therefore:\n  – Reaction 1 (E-oct-4-ene): racemic trans-4,5-octanediol (two enantiomers).\n  – Reaction 2 (Z-oct-4-ene): meso trans-4,5-octanediol (single meso isomer).\nCoT-SC agent mZT6, determining stereochemical outcome of (E)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: mCPBA epoxidation of an E-alkene proceeds via a concerted syn addition to give a trans-disubstituted epoxide. Because the epoxide center is chiral, one obtains both enantiomers (R,R and S,S) in equal amounts (a racemic mixture). Subsequent acid‐catalyzed ring opening of this trans epoxide by anti addition of water yields the racemic trans‐4,5‐octanediol (still two enantiomers).; answer: Two stereoisomers: a racemic pair of the trans epoxide (R,R and S,S), which on acidic ring opening gives the racemic trans‐4,5‐octanediol.\nCoT-SC agent FkjB, determining stereochemical outcome of (E)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: mCPBA performs a stereospecific syn epoxidation: an E-alkene yields the trans epoxide. There is no internal symmetry, so the product is formed as a racemic pair of enantiomers.; answer: The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with one equivalent of mCPBA (followed by workup) gives a trans-4,5-epoxyoctane as a racemic mixture (two enantiomeric stereoisomers).\nCoT-SC agent H9M8, determining stereochemical outcome of (E)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: mCPBA syn epoxidation of an E‐alkene yields a trans epoxide. Because both epoxide carbons bear inequivalent substituents, the trans epoxide is chiral. One equiv of mCPBA gives a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.; answer: E-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA/aqueous acid gives a racemic trans-4,5-epoxyoctane: two enantiomeric epoxide products.\nCoT-SC agent gY9o, determining stereochemical outcome of (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: For a Z-alkene, syn epoxidation with mCPBA yields the cis epoxide. In the case of oct-4-ene, both substituents on the double bond are identical alkyl chains, so the cis epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is meso. Upon aqueous acid opening (anti addition), this meso epoxide gives a single meso trans-4,5-octanediol. Thus only one stereoisomer is ever formed.; answer: One stereoisomer: the meso cis-epoxide (which opens to the meso trans-4,5-octanediol).\nCoT-SC agent Kefg, determining stereochemical outcome of (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: Epoxidation with mCPBA is a concerted syn addition. For the Z‐alkene, both substituents on each alkene carbon are identical butyl chains, so the cis‐epoxide is achiral (meso). Under aqueous acid the epoxide opens by anti addition to give the trans‐diol, which for identical substituents is also the meso isomer. Thus only one stereoisomer is formed.; answer: Only one stereoisomer is formed: a single meso (cis) epoxide, which upon acid‐catalyzed opening yields a single meso trans-4,5-octanediol.\nCoT-SC agent UTx9, determining stereochemical outcome of (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: Z-oct-4-ene is a disubstituted alkene with identical propyl groups on each C. mCPBA adds O syn to give the cis-epoxide. Because the substituents are identical, this epoxide has an internal mirror plane and is meso. No enantiomeric pair is formed – only one stereoisomer is produced.; answer: One product: the cis-epoxide (meso), a single stereoisomer.\nDebate agent PFVw, round 0, combining products and analyzing stereoisomers, thinking: Based on previous tasks, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene followed by acid gives a racemic trans-4,5-octanediol (two enantiomers), while the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a single meso trans-4,5-octanediol. Combining both yields three distinct stereoisomers.; answer: Three distinct stereoisomers: the two enantiomers of the trans-4,5-octanediol (from the E-alkene) and the meso trans-4,5-octanediol (from the Z-alkene).\nDebate agent pCDA, round 0, combining products and analyzing stereoisomers, thinking: The E-alkene gives a racemic pair of trans-4,5-octanediol (two enantiomers); the Z-alkene gives only the meso trans-4,5-octanediol. Combined, there are three distinct stereoisomers.; answer: Three distinct stereoisomeric products (two enantiomers plus one meso diol).\nFinal Decision agent, deciding total stereoisomeric products, thinking: The (E)-alkene gives a racemic pair of trans-4,5-octanediol (two enantiomers), and the (Z)-alkene gives the meso trans-4,5-octanediol, for a total of three distinct stereoisomeric products.; answer: Three distinct stereoisomeric products.\nCoT agent nfEW, evaluating standard HPLC behavior, thinking: The racemic pair from the (E)-alkene coelutes as one peak on an achiral column, and the meso diol from the (Z)-alkene gives a second distinct peak. Thus two resolved peaks.; answer: 2 peaks\nCoT agent Pbp1, evaluating chiral HPLC behavior, thinking: The combined mixture contains the racemic trans‐diol pair from the (E)‐alkene (two enantiomers) plus the meso diol from the (Z)‐alkene. On a chiral column the enantiomers are resolved into two peaks while the achiral meso compound gives a single peak, for a total of three.; answer: 3 peaks\nReflexion CoT agent RJJQ, comparing chromatographic results and selecting best answer, thinking: The standard HPLC resolves the meso diol (from Z-alkene) and the racemic pair (from E-alkene) as two peaks. The chiral HPLC resolves the two enantiomers plus the meso form as three peaks. Thus the pattern is 2 peaks on standard and 3 peaks on chiral.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
