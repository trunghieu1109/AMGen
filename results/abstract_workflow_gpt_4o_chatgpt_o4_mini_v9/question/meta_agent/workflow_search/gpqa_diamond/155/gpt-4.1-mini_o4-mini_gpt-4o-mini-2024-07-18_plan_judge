Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_155
proposed answer: The standard HPLC resolves the meso diol (from Z-alkene) and the racemic pair (from E-alkene) as two peaks. The chiral HPLC resolves the two enantiomers plus the meso form as three peaks. Thus the pattern is 2 peaks on standard and 3 peaks on chiral.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_155
proposed answer: The mixture contains a meso diol (achiral) and a racemic pair of trans diols (enantiomers). On an achiral reverse-phase column, enantiomers coelute while diastereomers separate, giving two peaks (meso vs. both trans enantiomers). On a chiral column, the meso diol remains one peak and the trans enantiomers resolve into two separate peaks, for a total of three.

Answer:Standard reverse-phase HPLC: 2 peaks; Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.
