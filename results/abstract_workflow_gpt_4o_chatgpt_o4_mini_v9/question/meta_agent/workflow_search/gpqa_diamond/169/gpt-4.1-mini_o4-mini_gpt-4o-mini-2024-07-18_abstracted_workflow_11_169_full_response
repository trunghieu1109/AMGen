Taking the complex conjugate of each component gives (−3i/5, 4/5), and transposing yields the 1×2 row vector.; answer: (-3i/5, 4/5)\nCoT agent kokI, multiplying S_y and spin state, thinking: We have S_y = (ħ/2)[[0, -i],[i, 0]] and |ψ⟩ = (3i/5, 4/5). Multiply the matrix by the vector: [[0, -i],[i, 0]]·(3i/5,4/5)^T gives (–4i/5, –3/5).
