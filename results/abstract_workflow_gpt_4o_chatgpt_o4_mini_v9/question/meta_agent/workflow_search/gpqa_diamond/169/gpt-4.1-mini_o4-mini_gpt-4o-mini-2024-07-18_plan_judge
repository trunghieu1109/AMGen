Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_169
proposed answer: Comparing the simplified expectation value -24/25·(ħ/2) = -12ħ/25 with the provided options shows it matches option B: -12ħ/25.
