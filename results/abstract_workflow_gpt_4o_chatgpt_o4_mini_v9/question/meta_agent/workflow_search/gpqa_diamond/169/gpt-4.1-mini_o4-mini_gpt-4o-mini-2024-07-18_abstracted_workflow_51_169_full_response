Dividing each component by 5 gives the normalized state.; answer: Sub-task 1: Norm = 5, normalized spin state = (3i/5, 4/5).\nCoT agent 2k7U, expressing normalized spin state as column vector, thinking: We take the normalized spin state (3i/5, 4/5) and write it in column form for matrix multiplication.; answer: Sub-task 2: The normalized spin state as a column vector is \\begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\\\ 4/5 \\end{pmatrix}.\nCoT agent oQP8, writing spin operator matrix sigma_y, thinking: The spin operator along y for a spin-1/2 system is by definition given as the Pauli matrix σ_y.; answer: sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nCoT agent qYHy, calculating operator S_y, thinking: The spin operator S_y is defined as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y, so multiply each entry of σ_y by ħ/2.; answer: S_y = (ħ/2)·[[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0]]\nCoT agent QZsP, applying operator S_y, thinking: We apply S_y=(ħ/2)[[0, -i],[i,0]] to |ψ>=(3i/5,4/5). Compute first component: (ħ/2)*(0·3i/5 + (−i)·4/5)=−4iħ/10=−2iħ/5. Second: (ħ/2)*(i·3i/5+0)=3i^2ħ/10=−3ħ/10.; answer: Sub-task 5: The transformed state vector is \\begin{pmatrix}-2i\\hbar/5\\\\-3\\hbar/10\\end{pmatrix}.\nCoT agent oS5S, computing expectation value, thinking: We compute ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ with |ψ⟩=(3i/5,4/5): (3i/5)*=−3i/5, so ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (−3i/5)(−2iħ/5)+(4/5)(−3ħ/10)=−6ħ/25−6ħ/25=−12ħ/25.; answer: The expectation value of S_y is -12 ħ/25.\nCoT agent qYhs, simplifying expectation value, thinking: From sub-task 6 we obtained ⟨Sy⟩=−12ħ/25, which is already a real number times ħ.
