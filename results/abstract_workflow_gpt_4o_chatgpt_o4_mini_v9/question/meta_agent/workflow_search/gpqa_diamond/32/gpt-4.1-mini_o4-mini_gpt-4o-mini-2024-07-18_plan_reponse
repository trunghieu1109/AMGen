The oxygen from the furan-2,5-dione becomes the bridging heteroatom (epoxy) in the bicyclic adduct. Stereochemically, the exo product has the methyl groups oriented such that C4 and C7 centers adopt R and S configurations respectively, matching the (3aR,4R,7S,7aS) designation. This corresponds to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
