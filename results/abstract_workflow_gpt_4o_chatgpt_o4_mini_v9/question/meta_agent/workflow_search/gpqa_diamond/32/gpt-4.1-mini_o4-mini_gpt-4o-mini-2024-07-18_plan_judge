Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_32
proposed answer: Comparing the predicted EXO product stereochemistry (3aR,4S,7R,7aS) with the given choices, only choice 4 has the correct bridgehead sulfur, trans methyl groups, and matching stereochemical descriptors for the EXO cycloadduct.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_45_32
proposed answer: Under thermal conditions, the Diels–Alder reaction of 2,5-dimethylthiophene with furan-2,5-dione proceeds via an exo approach, placing the furan’s oxygen bridge external to the newly formed ring. The oxygen from the furan-2,5-dione becomes the bridging heteroatom (epoxy) in the bicyclic adduct. Stereochemically, the exo product has the methyl groups oriented such that C4 and C7 centers adopt R and S configurations respectively, matching the (3aR,4R,7S,7aS) designation. This corresponds to choice 3.
