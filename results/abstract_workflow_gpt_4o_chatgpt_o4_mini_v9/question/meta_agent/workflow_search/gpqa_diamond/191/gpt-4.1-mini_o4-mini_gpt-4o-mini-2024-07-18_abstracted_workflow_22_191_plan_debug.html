    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}.

### Sub-task 6: Compare the derived expression for the electric field magnitude at point P with the provided multiple-choice options, analyzing each option&#39;s dependence on l, s, theta, and L to determine which matches the physical and mathematical result. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent BNAy:
The derived expression E = (1/4πε₀)·q/(l² + s² – 2 l s cosθ) exactly matches E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² since L² = l² + s² – 2 l s cosθ. None of the other options reproduce this dependence.

### thinking by Debate Agent KHn8:
The uniqueness theorem shows the external field is that of a point charge q at the conductor’s center, so E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² with L² = l² + s² − 2ls cosθ. Among the options, only choice D matches E ∝1/L².

### thinking by Debate Agent g52z:
By the uniqueness theorem, the external field of this neutral conductor with an internal off-center charge +q is identical to that of a point charge +q placed at the sphere’s center. Hence E at P depends only on L, giving E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L². Among the options, only choice 4 matches this form.

### thinking by Debate Agent NbJm:
We found by the uniqueness theorem that the external field is identical to that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s centre, so E=(1/4πε₀)·q/L² where L² = l²+s²−2ls cosθ. Only choice4 matches this L dependence.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Conclude the correct formula for the electric field magnitude at point P outside the spherical conductor with the cavity and internal charge, based on the comparison and physical reasoning.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
