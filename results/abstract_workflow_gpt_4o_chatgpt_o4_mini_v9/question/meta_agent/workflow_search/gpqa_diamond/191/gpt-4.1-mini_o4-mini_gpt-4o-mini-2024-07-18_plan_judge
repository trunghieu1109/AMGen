Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: By the uniqueness theorem, the external field of the neutral conductor with an off-center internal charge +q is identical to that of a point charge +q placed at the conductor’s centre. Hence the field at P depends only on L, giving E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L².

Answer:E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{L^2}
Extracted answer: E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{L^2}
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: By electrostatic shielding and Gauss’s law, the induced charges on the conductor ensure that the external field is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the sphere’s center. Hence E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L², matching choice4.
