    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Based on the derived electric field expression, evaluate the candidate expressions for the electric field magnitude at point P given in the choices, by comparing them with the derived theoretical expression and the geometric relationships involving l, s, theta, and L. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent dVVM:
By electrostatic shielding, the field outside depends only on the total charge +q at the conductor’s center, giving E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L². Among the choices, only choice4 matches this expression.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 4wFR:
By Gauss’s law the net induced charge +q resides effectively at the conductor’s centre for fields outside, so E must be (1/4πε₀)q/L², independent of l, s, or θ. None of the other forms reduce to q/L² for arbitrary geometry.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent n8jL:
For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the induced charges ensure that outside the sphere the field is as if all charge +q were concentrated at the conductor’s center, independent of the cavity displacement. Thus E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L². Among the given options only choice4 matches this result.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5pEU:
The conductor’s shielding means the net external field is as if +q is at the sphere’s center, giving E=(1/4πε₀)q/L². Choices A and B depend on l,s,θ (inside geometry) and C uses l (cavity center), so only D matches the derived expression.

    <pre>By electrostatic shielding and Gauss’s law, the induced charges on the conductor ensure that the external field is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the sphere’s center. Hence E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L², matching choice4.
