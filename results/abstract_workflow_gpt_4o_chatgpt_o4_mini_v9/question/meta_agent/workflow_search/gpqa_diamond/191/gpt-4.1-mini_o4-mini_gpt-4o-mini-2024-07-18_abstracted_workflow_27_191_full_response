A point charge +q sits somewhere inside that cavity. We seek the field at an external point P, whose position vector from O has magnitude L (so |OP|=L>R), and whose vector from C has magnitude l (so |CP|=l). The angle θ between vectors s (O→C) and l (C→P) satisfies l² = L² + s² − 2Ls\u2009cos\u2009θ. The conductor is uncharged, so induced charges appear on the inner and outer surfaces, but outside the conductor the field depends only on the total enclosed charge +q and behaves as if placed at O.; answer: We have:\n• Conductor center O, cavity center C displaced by vector s (|s|=s).  \n• External point P at distance L from O (|OP|=L>R).  \n• Distance from C to P is l (|CP|=l), with θ the angle between s and l (so l²=L²+s²−2Ls\u2009cosθ).  \n• r<R ensures the cavity lies entirely within the conductor.  \nThis geometry sets up O, C, P in space with known separations and angle θ.\nCoT-SC agent ImhY, classifying electrostatic conditions, thinking: We recognize that in electrostatic equilibrium the conductor’s interior is an equipotential and the field inside the conducting material is zero. A point charge +q in the cavity induces exactly –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface so the net on the metal is zero. Outside, by Gauss’s law, the field depends only on the total enclosed charge +q as if concentrated at the conductor’s center.; answer: The conductor is an equipotential (E=0 in its bulk). The +q inside the cavity induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface (so the conductor remains uncharged overall). The external field is exactly that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s center, i.e. E_out=(1/4πε₀)·q/L² radially outward.\nCoT-SC agent wWE5, classifying electrostatic conditions, thinking: The conductor must be an equipotential (E=0 in its metal). Placing +q in the cavity induces –q on the inner cavity surface (to cancel E in the metal) and +q on the outer surface (so conductor remains neutral overall). Outside the conductor the field is due solely to the net +q on the outer surface and is exactly that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s center, independent of the cavity’s position.; answer: The conductor is an equipotential: E=0 throughout its metal. The +q inside the cavity induces –q distributed on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. The external field at distance L from the conductor’s center is exactly E=(1/4πε₀)(q/L²) directed radially outward.\nCoT-SC agent nQGm, classifying electrostatic conditions, thinking: We need to classify the electrostatic conditions for an uncharged conductor with an off‐centre cavity containing charge +q. In electrostatic equilibrium the conductor’s interior field is zero and it is an equipotential. The point charge induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. Outside the conductor only the total +q on the outer surface contributes, yielding the same external field as if a point charge +q were at the conductor’s centre.; answer: In electrostatic equilibrium the conductor is an equipotential and its interior field is zero. The point charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge –q on the cavity’s inner surface and +q on the outer surface. Outside the conductor, only the net +q on the outer surface contributes, so the external field is that of a point charge +q located at the conductor’s centre.\nCoT agent DKMj, analyzing position vectors and distances, thinking: We need to relate the vectors from the conductor center O and cavity center C to point P.  Let r_OP=OP vector of magnitude L, r_OC=OC vector of magnitude s, and r_CP=CP vector of magnitude l.  Then r_CP = r_OP – r_OC.  Taking magnitudes gives the law of cosines l² = L² + s² – 2Ls\u2009cosθ, where θ is the angle between r_OP and r_OC.  This expresses the position of P relative to both centers and sets up for the E-field calculation.; answer: Vectorially, C→P = O→P – O→C.  Hence l = |r_OP – r_OC| = √(L² + s² – 2 L s cosθ),  with θ the angle between the O→P and O→C vectors.\nReflexion CoT agent wbnZ, deriving electric field expression, thinking: In electrostatic equilibrium the conductor shields the interior charge, inducing –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law the field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge +q as if concentrated at the conductor’s center.; answer: E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² radially outward\nCritic agent yugK, providing feedback, thinking: The expression E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² radially outward is correct and complete. By electrostatic shielding the induced –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface ensure that the net enclosed charge is +q at the conductor’s center, so by Gauss’s law the external field is that of a point charge +q at the center.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}\\text{ (radially outward)}\nReflexion CoT agent wbnZ, refining electric field expression, thinking: In electrostatic equilibrium the conductor’s induced –q on the cavity wall and +q on its outer surface leave a net +q on the exterior.
