When +q is placed in an off-center cavity, it induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. The conductor remains an equipotential and shields its interior, so the external field depends only on the total induced outer charge. The cavity’s off-center placement affects the inner charge distribution but not the uniformity of the outer induced charge, hence not the external field’s symmetry.; answer: Physical setup and constraints:\n\n• Spherical conductor of radius R, initially uncharged (net charge = 0).\n• Inside it is a small spherical cavity of radius r, whose centre is displaced by vector s from the conductor’s centre (r < R).\n• A point charge +q resides somewhere inside this cavity.\n• The presence of +q induces –q on the cavity’s inner surface and +q on the conductor’s outer surface, keeping the conductor neutral and at constant potential.\n• Observation point P lies outside the conductor at distance L from the conductor’s centre (L > R) and at distance l from the cavity’s centre (l > R).\n\nSignificance of conductor being uncharged and cavity placement:\n\n• Conductor neutrality forces induced charges that exactly cancel the enclosed +q, ensuring zero field within the conducting material.\n• The off-centre cavity leads to an asymmetric inner induced charge distribution but the outer induced +q distributes uniformly over the spherical surface, preserving radial symmetry of the external field.\n• Consequently, the external electric field depends only on the total induced outer charge (+q) and behaves as if produced by a point charge +q at the conductor’s centre.\nCoT agent RbCM, analyzing electrostatic behavior, thinking: For sub-task 3 we must describe how the internal +q induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface, note that the outer induced +q spreads uniformly over the spherical conductor giving a radially symmetric external field equal to that of a point charge +q at the centre. No additional data is needed to draw these standard conclusions.; answer: Analysis of electrostatic behavior (Sub-task 3):\n\n• Induced charge distribution:\n  – The point charge +q inside the off-centre cavity induces a total charge –q on the inner surface of the cavity, distributed nonuniformly to maintain zero field in the conductor’s bulk.\n  – To preserve overall neutrality, a charge +q appears on the outer surface of the conductor.  \n  – Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere and the conductor is an equipotential, this +q is distributed uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n• Effect on external electric field at point P (distance L from conductor centre):\n  – From Gauss’s law or symmetry, the field outside depends only on the total outer charge +q, regardless of the cavity’s displacement.\n  – Therefore, at P (L>R), the field is exactly that of a point charge +q located at the conductor’s centre:\n    E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L², directed radially outward.\nCoT agent f1jN, applying method of images, thinking: For sub-task 4 we note that from uniqueness theorems the external field of a neutral spherical conductor with an off-center cavity and internal charge +q is identical to that of a single point charge +q at the sphere’s center. No image-charge construction is needed outside: the induced +q on the outer surface spreads uniformly. Thus the displacement s and angle θ do not affect the external field. ; answer: The effective external charge distribution is a uniform +q on the spherical surface, equivalent to a point charge +q at the center. The electric field at P (distance L>R) is\nE= (1/4πε₀)·q/L², directed radially outward.\nCoT agent mrJX, expressing and simplifying E, thinking: By the uniqueness theorem the external field of the neutral conductor with an off‐center cavity and internal charge +q is identical to that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s centre. Hence E depends only on the distance L from that centre. Since geometrically L² = l² + s² – 2 l s cos\u2009θ, one may eliminate L and write the result wholly in terms of q, l, s, θ and ε₀.; answer: E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/(l² + s² – 2 l s cos\u2009θ)\nDebate agent BNAy, round 0, comparing options, thinking: The derived expression E = (1/4πε₀)·q/(l² + s² – 2 l s cosθ) exactly matches E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² since L² = l² + s² – 2 l s cosθ.
