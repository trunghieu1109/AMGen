    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ by taking the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient corresponding to the |1,-1&gt;|1,-1&gt; component in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1&gt;. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Fawg:
In the |1,1,2,−1&gt; expansion only |−1,0&gt; and |0,−1&gt; appear with coefficients 1/√2; there is no |−1,−1&gt; term so its coefficient is 0 and the probability is |0|^2=0.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent pPqa:
The total m=−1 state only has components |1,−1&gt;|1,0&gt; and |1,0&gt;|1,−1&gt; (each with coefficient 1/√2). There is no |1,−1&gt;|1,−1&gt; term, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero. The joint probability is the squared magnitude of this coefficient, i.e. 0.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ZH2q:
The coupled state |1,1,2,-1&gt; only has components with m1+m2 = -1, namely |1,-1&gt;|1,0&gt; and |1,0&gt;|1,-1&gt;. There is no |1,-1&gt;|1,-1&gt; term, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero. Hence the joint probability is 0.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent tbF3:
The coupled state |1,1,2,-1&gt; expands only into |1,-1&gt;|1,0&gt; and |1,0&gt;|1,-1&gt; with coefficients 1/√2. There is no |1,-1&gt;|1,-1&gt; term, so its coefficient is 0 and the probability is 0.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Fawg:
The joint probability P(L1z=−ħ and L2z=−ħ) = 0.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent pPqa:
0

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ZH2q:
0

### answer #1 by Debate Agent tbF3:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
