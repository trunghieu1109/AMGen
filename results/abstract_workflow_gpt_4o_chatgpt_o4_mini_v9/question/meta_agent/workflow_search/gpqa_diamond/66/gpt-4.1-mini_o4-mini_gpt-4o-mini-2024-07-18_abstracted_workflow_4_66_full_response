No missing information prevents this. Proceed with a concise restatement.; answer: We have two electrons, each with orbital angular momentum quantum number l₁ = 1 and l₂ = 1 (p-orbitals). They are coupled into a total orbital angular momentum state |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, −1⟩, where l = 2 is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and m = −1 is its z-component. The measurement to be made is of the individual z-components L₁z and L₂z, and we ask for the joint probability of finding both L₁z = −ħ and L₂z = −ħ.\nCoT agent HqdV, identifying uncoupled basis states, thinking: The uncoupled basis for two l=1 particles is simply all combinations of their individual m values. There are 3×3=9 such states labeled by m1,m2∈{−1,0,+1}.; answer: The uncoupled basis states are |l1=1,m1>⊗|l2=1,m2> with m1,m2∈{−1,0,+1}.

The uncoupled basis terms satisfy m1+m2 = -1, yielding (m1,m2)=(-1,0) and (0,-1). From standard Clebsch–Gordan tables for j1=j2=1 to J=2, the coefficients for these terms are both 1/sqrt(2).; answer: |1,1,2,-1> = (1/SQRT(2)) |1,m1=-1> |1,m2=0> + (1/SQRT(2)) |1,m1=0> |1,m2=-1>\nCoT-SC agent HoZE, expanding coupled state, thinking: To expand |1,1,2,-1> in the uncoupled basis |1,m1>|1,m2>, we need m1+m2 = -1. The only allowed pairs are (m1,m2)=(-1,0) and (0,-1). From standard Clebsch–Gordan tables for 1⊗1→2, the coefficients for these pairs at M=−1 are both √(1/2).; answer: |1,1,2,-1> = (1/√2)|1,−1>⊗|1,0> + (1/√2)|1,0>⊗|1,−1>\nCoT-SC agent ZBao, expanding coupled state, thinking: We need CG coefficients <1 m1;1 m2|2,−1> for m1+m2=−1.
