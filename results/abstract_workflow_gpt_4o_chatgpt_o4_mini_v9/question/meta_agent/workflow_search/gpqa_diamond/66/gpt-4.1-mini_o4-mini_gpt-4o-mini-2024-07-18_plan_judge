Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The total m=–1 coupled state |1,1,2,–1> expands only into |1,–1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,–1> (each with coefficient 1/√2). There is no |1,–1>|1,–1> component, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero and the joint probability is |0|^2=0.

proposed answer: The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> expands as (1/√2)(|1,-1>⊗|1,0> + |1,0>⊗|1,-1>) and contains no |1,-1>⊗|1,-1> term. Therefore the coefficient for that term is 0 and the joint probability is |0|^2 = 0.
