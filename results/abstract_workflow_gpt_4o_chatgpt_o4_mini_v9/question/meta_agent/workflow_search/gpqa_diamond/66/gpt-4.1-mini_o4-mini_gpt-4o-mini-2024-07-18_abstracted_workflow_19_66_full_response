I will clarify that we have two electrons each in p-orbitals (l1=1, l2=1), combined to total L=2 and M=−1, and that we will measure their individual Lz components to see if each equals −ħ.; answer: Sub-task 1: We have a two-electron system where each electron occupies a p orbital, so l₁ = 1 and l₂ = 1. These individual orbital angular momenta are coupled to yield a total orbital angular momentum state |l₁, l₂; l, m⟩ = |1, 1; 2, −1⟩, meaning the combined system has total L = 2 and total magnetic quantum number M = −1. The measurement to be made is of each electron’s z-component of orbital angular momentum, L₁z and L₂z, and we are interested in the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z are measured to be −ħ.\nCoT agent 2Arh, identifying uncoupled basis, thinking: Sub-task 2 asks for the uncoupled basis in which each electron has l=1 and m_z = -1, 0, or +1.

The only m1+m2 combinations giving M=-1 are m1=-1,m2=0 and m1=0,m2=-1.
