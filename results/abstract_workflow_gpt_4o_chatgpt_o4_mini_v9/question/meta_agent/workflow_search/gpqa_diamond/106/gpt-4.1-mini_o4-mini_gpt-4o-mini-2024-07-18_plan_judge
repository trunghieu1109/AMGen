proposed answer: Without specific structural representations (e.g., SMILES or 3D coordinates) for each tautomeric and stereoisomeric form of Xantheraquin, we cannot compute exact pKa, logD, or conformational energies. We can only propose a generic prioritization framework based on typical physicochemical trends and likely bioactive species.

Answer:1. Neutral keto tautomers predominant at pH 7.4 (logD ~1–3), low conformational strain, favorable PSA—highest priority for initial docking.
2. Singly protonated enol or zwitterionic forms with moderate lipophilicity (logD ~0–2) and pKa near physiological pH—second priority.
3. Minor high-energy tautomers or doubly charged species with poor membrane permeability and high strain—deprioritize.
4. Within each tautomeric group, prioritize stereoisomers with the lowest calculated DFT/force-field energies and R/S configurations predicted to complement the chiral binding pocket.
