We can only propose a generic prioritization framework based on typical physicochemical trends and likely bioactive species.\n\nAnswer:1. Neutral keto tautomers predominant at pH 7.4 (logD ~1\u20133), low conformational strain, favorable PSA\u2014highest priority for initial docking.\n2. Singly protonated enol or zwitterionic forms with moderate lipophilicity (logD ~0\u20132) and pKa near physiological pH\u2014second priority.\n3. Minor high-energy tautomers or doubly charged species with poor membrane permeability and high strain\u2014deprioritize.\n4. Within each tautomeric group, prioritize stereoisomers with the lowest calculated DFT/force-field energies and R/S configurations predicted to complement the chiral binding pocket.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the SMILES or high-resolution 3D structures for each chiral and tautomeric form of Xantheraquin to calculate precise energetics, pKa, and logD values and finalize the ranking.",
