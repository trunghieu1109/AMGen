Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_79
proposed answer: Given the underdetermined mapping and the previous computed result of 351, the only matching choice is 351. However, without more examples or defined rules, this selection remains speculative.

Answer:351
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide additional input–output examples or explicit base-to-number weight assignments and positional/offset rules to uniquely determine the algorithm.
Extracted answer: 351
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_51_79
proposed answer: With only two example mappings, the transformation rule remains underdetermined and infinitely many functions could fit. The majority of heuristic estimates point to choice B) 315 as the closest plausible value for a 9-letter string, but without an explicit letter→number mapping or more data, this remains a guess.

Answer:B) 315

Please provide additional input→output pairs or the explicit letter→number mapping rule to uniquely determine the transformation.
