The problem statement provides all these values explicitly, so no additional information request is needed.; answer: Extracted Data and Conditions:\n- Host star masses: both stars have masses similar to the Sun (≈1 M☉).\n- Planet masses: each planet has a mass similar to Neptune (≈1 M_Neptune).\n- Radial velocity (RV) wavelength shifts:\n  • Planet #1 induces a periodic shift of 5 milliångströms (5 mÅ).\n  • Planet #2 induces a periodic shift of 7 milliångströms (7 mÅ).\n- Orbit characteristics: both planets are in circular orbits around their host stars.\nCoT-SC agent jVoA, analyzing RV wavelength shifts to orbital velocities, thinking: To relate the observed wavelength shifts to orbital velocities we use the Doppler formula v/c = Δλ/λ₀ ⇒ v = c·(Δλ/λ₀). Here Δλ1 = 5 mÅ, Δλ2 = 7 mÅ, λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, and c is the speed of light. The absolute velocities scale as v1 ∝ 5 and v2 ∝ 7, so their ratio is v2/v1 = 7/5 = 1.4.; answer: Using Doppler principles: v = c·Δλ/λ₀ so v1 = c·(5 mÅ)/λ₀, v2 = c·(7 mÅ)/λ₀, and thus v2/v1 = 7/5 = 1.4.\nCoT-SC agent Iz37, analyzing RV wavelength shifts to orbital velocities, thinking: To relate RV wavelength shifts (Δλ) to orbital velocities (v), use the Doppler formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v/c for non-relativistic speeds. Both planets induce shifts on the same spectral line (λ₀), so v ∝ Δλ. Thus v₁ = (c·5\u2009mÅ)/λ₀ and v₂ = (c·7\u2009mÅ)/λ₀. The ratio v₂/v₁ = (7\u2009mÅ)/(5\u2009mÅ) = 1.4.; answer: Using Δλ/λ₀ = v/c, we find v₂/v₁ = 7\u2009mÅ/5\u2009mÅ = 1.4.\nCoT-SC agent zDKA, analyzing RV wavelength shifts to orbital velocities, thinking: To relate RV wavelength shifts to orbital velocities, we use the Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds: v_r = (Δλ/λ)·c, where λ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (same for both stars) and c is the speed of light. Since λ and c are identical in both cases, the orbital velocity scales directly with Δλ. Thus v2/v1 = Δλ2/Δλ1 = 7\u2009mÅ / 5\u2009mÅ = 1.4.; answer: The orbital velocity of planet #2 is 1.4 times that of planet #1.\nCoT agent KObC, calculating orbital velocity ratio, thinking: We use the Doppler relation v∝Δλ. Given Δλ1=5\u2009mÅ and Δλ2=7\u2009mÅ, the velocity ratio v2/v1=Δλ2/Δλ1=7/5=1.4.; answer: The ratio of the orbital velocities is v2/v1 = 1.4.\nCoT agent TdZo, relating orbital velocity and radius with Kepler's laws, thinking: For a circular orbit around a star of given mass, the orbital speed v and orbital radius r are related by v=2πr/T, so T=2πr/v. This directly uses Kepler’s third law for circular motion (GM constant cancels when expressing T in terms of r and v).; answer: For a circular orbit, T = 2π·r / v\nCoT agent NWbo, deriving orbital period ratio, thinking: For circular orbits around equal mass stars, v∝r^(–1/2) and T∝r^(3/2) so T∝v^(–3).
