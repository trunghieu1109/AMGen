I parsed star and planet masses, orbital characteristics, RV wavelength shifts, and the target question about orbital period ratio.; answer: Sub-task 1: Relevant physical quantities and parameters:\n\n1. Stellar parameters:\n   - Star #1 mass: ≈ 1 M☉\n   - Star #2 mass: ≈ 1 M☉\n\n2. Planetary parameters:\n   - Planet #1 mass: ≈ Neptune mass\n   - Planet #2 mass: ≈ Neptune mass\n\n3. Orbital characteristics:\n   - Both orbits are circular (eccentricity e = 0)\n\n4. Radial velocity (RV) method data:\n   - Observed spectral line wavelength (same line for both)\n   - Planet #1 RV shift amplitude: up to 5 milliångström (mÅ)\n   - Planet #2 RV shift amplitude: 7 milliångström (mÅ)\n\n5. Target question:\n   - Find the ratio of orbital periods T₂/T₁.\nCoT-SC agent OBys, extracting essential features, thinking: We need to extract and summarize the key physical parameters identified in Sub-task 1 without additional calculations: the stellar masses, planetary masses, orbital shapes, and measured RV wavelength shifts.; answer: Both host stars have masses ≈1 M☉; both planets have masses similar to Neptune; both orbits are circular; the RV spectral line shift amplitude is 5 milliångström for planet #1 and 7 milliångström for planet #2.\nCoT-SC agent 2bXw, extracting essential features, thinking: Extracted key parameters from Sub-task 1 classification.; answer: Both stars have masses similar to the Sun; both planets have masses similar to Neptune; both orbits are circular; the measured periodic wavelength shifts are 5 mÅ for planet #1 and 7 mÅ for planet #2.\nCoT-SC agent luwI, extracting essential features, thinking: The user asks for a concise summary of the key parameters identified in Sub-task 1: host star masses, planet masses, orbit shapes, and measured RV wavelength shifts. All needed info is present, so no [TOO_HARD] needed.; answer: Host stars: ≈1 M☉ each; Planet masses: ≈Neptune; Orbits: circular; RV wavelength shifts: 5 mÅ for planet #1 and 7 mÅ for planet #2.\nCoT agent zyFA, identifying physical relationships, thinking: To link observed wavelength shifts to orbital periods via the RV method, we use (a) the Doppler formula relating a spectral shift Δλ to the star’s line-of-sight velocity, (b) the expression for the star’s reflex velocity in a circular orbit, (c) Kepler’s third law relating orbital period and semi-major axis, and (d) the relation between the planet’s mass, the star’s mass, and the star’s orbital radius about the center of mass. These give a chain of equations connecting Δλ to T.; answer: 1. Doppler shift: Δλ/λ₀ = v_star/c, so v_star = (Δλ/λ₀)·c.  \n2. Reflex velocity in a circular orbit: v_star = K = (2π a_star sin i)/T (here i≈90° so sin i≈1).  \n3. Kepler’s third law: a_planet³ = G (M_star + M_planet) T²/(4π²) ≈ G M_star T²/(4π²) since M_planet ≪ M_star.  \n4. Center-of-mass relation: a_star = (M_planet/M_star)·a_planet.  \nCombining these lets you express T in terms of Δλ (via v_star) and known masses and wavelength λ₀.\nCoT agent hGxl, calculating radial velocity amplitudes, thinking: To compute K we need the rest wavelength λ₀. Without λ₀ we can only give symbolic expressions. Hence we express K1 and K2 symbolically and request λ₀ for numeric values.; answer: K₁ = (Δλ₁/λ₀)·c = (5×10⁻³ Å / λ₀)·c\nK₂ = (Δλ₂/λ₀)·c = (7×10⁻³ Å / λ₀)·c\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the rest wavelength λ₀ of the spectral line to compute numeric radial velocity amplitudes.\nCoT agent ORWf, deriving orbital period relation, thinking: For circular, edge-on orbits the RV semi‐amplitude K and orbital period P are related by the standard formula K = (2πG/P)^(1/3)·(m_p\u2009sin\u2009i)/(M_s\u2009+\u2009m_p)^(2/3).  Neglecting m_p compared to M_s gives K = (2πG/P)^(1/3)·(m_p\u2009sin\u2009i)/M_s^(2/3).  Solving for P yields the desired relationship.; answer: For each planet:\nK = (2πG/P)^(1/3)·(m_p\u2009sin\u2009i)/M_s^(2/3)\n⇒ P = 2πG·(m_p\u2009sin\u2009i)^3/(K^3\u2009M_s^2)\nCoT agent hhOe, expressing ratio of orbital periods, thinking: For circular, edge-on orbits with identical stellar and planetary masses, P∝K⁻³.
