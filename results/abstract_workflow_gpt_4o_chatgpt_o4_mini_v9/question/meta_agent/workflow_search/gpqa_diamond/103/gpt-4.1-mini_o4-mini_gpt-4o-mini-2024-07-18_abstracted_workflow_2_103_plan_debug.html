    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.36&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 1.40&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 1.96&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 0.85&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated ratio of orbital periods with the provided multiple-choice options (~0.36, ~1.40, ~1.96, ~0.85) and select the closest match. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent rrbf:
We found P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³ = (5/7)³ ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364, which matches choice ~0.36.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent q2rL:
Since P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36, the closest match among the choices is ~0.36, corresponding to option A).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent rrbf:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent q2rL:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on the closest multiple-choice answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
