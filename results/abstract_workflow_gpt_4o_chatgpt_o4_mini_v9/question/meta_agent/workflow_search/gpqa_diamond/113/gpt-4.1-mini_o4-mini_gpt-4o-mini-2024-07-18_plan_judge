Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_113
proposed answer: Cyanohydrin formation from butan-2-one and NaCN requires protonation by a strong acid (H3O+). Subsequent hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid is efficiently accomplished under strong acid catalysis (HCl). This corresponds to choice 4 (D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_17_113
proposed answer: Both sub-task analyses agree that acid-catalyzed addition of HCN to butan-2-one requires A = H3O+ and subsequent acid hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid requires B = HCl. This corresponds to choice 4.
