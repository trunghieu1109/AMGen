Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the outputs of Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4, debate and select the correct pair of reagents (A and B) from the given choices that satisfy both reaction conditions simultaneously. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent nHyl:
The first reaction requires acid-catalyzed formation of the cyanohydrin, so A = H3O+. The second requires strong acid hydrolysis of the nitrile, so B = HCl. Among the given choices, that corresponds to choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent g9SR:
Sub-task 3 identifies A as H3O+ and Sub-task 4 identifies B as HCl, which corresponds to choice 4.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent nHyl:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent g9SR:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct reagent pair.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Both sub-task analyses agree that acid-catalyzed addition of HCN to butan-2-one requires A = H3O+ and subsequent acid hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid requires B = HCl. This corresponds to choice 4.
