Thus reagent A must be an acid catalyst such as H3O+.; answer: Reagent A is an acid catalyst (e.g. H3O+), which protonates the carbonyl and generates HCN in situ to enable cyanohydrin formation.\nCoT agent fbs1, analyzing reagent B, thinking: Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strongly acidic conditions to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, activate the C≡N bond, and allow water to add and ultimately yield the acid. A strong acid like HCl is typically used.; answer: Reagent B is a strong acid catalyst, e.g. HCl, to hydrolyze the nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid.\nCoT-SC agent ouRw, evaluating reagent A, thinking: The formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN requires an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, increase electrophilicity, and generate HCN in situ. H₃O⁺ fulfills this role by providing the necessary acidic environment. NaHSO₃, by contrast, would add as bisulfite to the carbonyl rather than promote cyanohydrin formation.; answer: A = H3O+\nCoT-SC agent JRBT, evaluating reagent A, thinking: To form the cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, we need a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl and generate HCN in situ. H3O+ fulfills this role, whereas NaHSO3 would add to the carbonyl itself and not catalyze cyanohydrin formation.; answer: H3O+\nCoT-SC agent PC0O, evaluating reagent A, thinking: The formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone and NaCN requires acid to protonate the carbonyl, increase electrophilicity, and generate HCN in situ. H3O+ fulfills this role as an acid catalyst. NaHSO3 would instead add bisulfite and not generate HCN or protonate effectively.; answer: H3O+\nCoT-SC agent mccd, evaluating reagent B, thinking: Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strongly acidic conditions to protonate and activate the –C≡N bond. Glacial acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is too weak to effect complete hydrolysis, whereas HCl provides the strong acid needed to catalyze nitrile hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.; answer: Suitable reagent B: HCl\nCoT-SC agent IQ23, evaluating reagent B, thinking: Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires a strong acid catalyst to protonate and activate the C≡N bond. Acetic acid (pKa ~4.8) is too weak to efficiently hydrolyze a nitrile. HCl is a strong acid and provides the necessary protonation and activation for nitrile hydrolysis to the corresponding carboxylic acid.; answer: HCl\nCoT-SC agent GQYr, evaluating reagent B, thinking: Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strong acidic conditions to protonate and activate the C≡N bond. Acetic acid is too weak to efficiently hydrolyze a nitrile, whereas HCl provides the necessary strong acid environment. Therefore, HCl is the suitable reagent B.; answer: HCl\nDebate agent nHyl, round 0, debating reagent pair, thinking: The first reaction requires acid-catalyzed formation of the cyanohydrin, so A = H3O+.
