Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Based on evaluations of reagent A and B compatibility, select the suitable pair of reagents (A and B) from the given choices that correctly correspond to the reagents needed for the two reactions. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IGJM:
Sub-task 4 shows only A = H3O+ enables cyanohydrin formation; sub-task 5 shows only B = HCl enables efficient nitrile hydrolysis. The combination A = H3O+, B = HCl corresponds to choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fZnE:
Cyanohydrin formation requires protonation by a strong acid (H3O+), and nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid requires a strong acid (HCl). That matches A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is choice 4 (D).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent IGJM:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent fZnE:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on suitable reagents A and B.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
