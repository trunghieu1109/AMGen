The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, typical of esters or amides. Together, a primary N–H and a C=O indicate an amide functional group.; answer: 3420, 3325 cm⁻¹: N–H stretches of a primary amide (two N–H bonds)\n1720 cm⁻¹: C=O stretch of an amide\nCoT-SC agent 0aMv, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: IR indicates a primary amide (two N–H stretches and a C=O). The 1H NMR must accommodate NH2, an ethoxy moiety, and a disubstituted aromatic ring. A triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) with J≈7\u2009Hz are typical of CH3–CH2–O. A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) fits the two NH protons of –CONH2. Two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (2H each, J≈8.5\u2009Hz) correspond to the four aromatic H’s of a para‐disubstituted benzene.; answer: 1.20\u2009ppm (t, 3H): CH3 of ethoxy\n4.5\u2009ppm (q, 2H): CH2 of ethoxy adjacent to O\n4.0\u2009ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 of the primary amide\n7.0\u2009ppm (d, 2H) & 8.0\u2009ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons in a para‐disubstituted benzene ring\nCoT-SC agent zTAI, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The IR indicates a primary amine (NH2) and a carbonyl (C=O) of an ester or amide. The NMR shows a triplet (3H) at 1.20 and a quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm—typical of an ethyl group attached to oxygen (–OCH2CH3). A broad singlet (2H) at 4.0 ppm fits an –NH2. Two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate a para-disubstituted benzene. Together this points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the CH3 and CH2 of the ethoxy group, the NH2 protons, and two sets of aromatic protons adjacent to the NH2 and ester, respectively.; answer: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 of –OCH2CH3 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): CH2 of –OCH2CH3 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 protons 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic H ortho to NH2 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic H ortho to CO2Et\nCoT-SC agent QODH, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) pair up as an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom (O or N).
