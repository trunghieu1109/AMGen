        "response": "The validation workflow needs to cover clinical study design, sample diversity, statistical power, comparator methods, cross-reactivity, and multicenter assessment, but key details (sample panel composition, prevalence, gold standard, specimen types) are missing. I will provide a comprehensive protocol and flag missing information as [TOO_HARD] with a request for specifics.\n\nAnswer:1. Study design and ethical approval:\n   \u2022 Obtain IRB approval and informed consent.\n   \u2022 Define target sample size using expected prevalence, desired sensitivity/specificity, and statistical power calculations.\n   \u2022 Ensure diversity in age, disease severity, geographic location, and co-infection status.\n2. Reference standard and sample classification:\n   \u2022 Use a well-established gold-standard comparator (e.g., viral culture or reference RT-PCR assay).\n   \u2022 Collect multiple specimen types (e.g., blood, respiratory swabs, saliva) in validated transport media.\n   \u2022 Characterize each sample as true positive or negative by the comparator.\n3. Blinded, randomized testing:\n   \u2022 Label samples with unique codes and blind operators to status.\n   \u2022 Run the new RT-PCR kit with internal controls (positive, negative, no-template) in each batch.\n4. Data collection and analysis:\n   \u2022 Record Ct values and qualitative calls for all specimens and controls.\n   \u2022 Calculate sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV with 95% confidence intervals.\n   \u2022 Construct ROC curve; compute AUC.\n   \u2022 Assess reproducibility: intra- and inter-run precision (CV of Ct values).\n5. Cross-reactivity and specificity panel:\n   \u2022 Test against related viruses (other retroviruses, common respiratory pathogens).\n   \u2022 Evaluate impact of potential interfering substances.\n6. Multicenter and matrix validation:\n   \u2022 Perform external validation at \u22652 independent laboratories.\n   \u2022 Test additional specimen types and collection methods.\n7. Clinical concordance and statistical measures:\n   \u2022 Compute Cohen\u2019s kappa between new kit and reference method.\n   \u2022 Analyze discrepant results and perform sequencing or alternative testing for resolution.\n8. Reporting:\n   \u2022 Summarize LOD, dynamic range, sensitivity/specificity, PPV/NPV, AUC, reproducibility, and cross-reactivity findings.\n   \u2022 Document limitations, sample stability, and user instructions.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide: (a) detailed panel of well-characterized clinical samples (with age, severity, co-infections), (b) prevalence estimates and sample size/statistical power calculations, (c) chosen gold-standard comparator assay, and (d) list of specimen types and transport media to finalize validation protocols.",
