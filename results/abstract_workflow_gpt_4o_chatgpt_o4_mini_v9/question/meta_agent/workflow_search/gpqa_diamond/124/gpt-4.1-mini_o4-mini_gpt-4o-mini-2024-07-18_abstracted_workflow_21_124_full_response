No critical data is missing; the potential and system are fully specified. I will summarize the nature of the potential and the key quantum characteristics (energy spectrum, degeneracy, eigenfunctions).; answer: The potential V(r)=½\u2009m\u2009ω²r² is a central, isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator. Key characteristics:\n1) Separation of variables in spherical coordinates yields eigenfunctions ψ_{n_r,l,m}(r,θ,φ)=R_{n_r,l}(r)Y_{l}^{m}(θ,φ).\n2) Energy eigenvalues depend on n_r (radial quantum number) and l (angular quantum number) via E_{n_r,l}=[2n_r+l+3/2]ħω. Often one defines the total principal quantum number n=2n_r+l, giving E_n=(n+3/2)ħω.\n3) Degeneracy of level n is g_n=(n+1)(n+2)/2, corresponding to all allowed (n_r,l,m) with 2n_r+l=n.\nCoT-SC agent U7xb, classifying quantum states, thinking: The task asks to classify 3D isotropic oscillator states by (n,l,m_l), explain degeneracy g_n, and give energy E_n. This follows directly from standard results.; answer: States are labeled by three integers:\n• Principal quantum number n=0,1,2,….  \n• Angular momentum quantum number l=0,1,…,n  \n• Magnetic quantum number m_l=–l,–l+1,…,l.  \nEnergy depends only on n:  \nE_n=(n+3/2)ħω.  \nDegeneracy of level n is the number of (l,m_l) pairs:  \n   g_n=∑_{l=0}^n(2l+1)=(n+1)(n+2)/2.\nCoT-SC agent LoqG, classifying quantum states, thinking: Sub-task 1 gave the energy spectrum E_{n_r,l}=(2n_r+l+3/2)ħω and degeneracy g_n=(n+1)(n+2)/2 with n=2n_r+l. Using that, we can label and count states by (n_r,l,m_l), define principal quantum number n, and derive the degeneracy.; answer: Quantum states are labeled by (n_r,l,m_l) in spherical coordinates. One introduces the principal quantum number n=2n_r+l (n=0,1,2,…). The energy depends only on n: E_n=(n+3/2)ħω. For a given n the allowed orbital quantum numbers are l=n,n−2,n−4,… down to 0 or 1 (matching parity of n). For each l there are (2l+1) values of m_l=−l,…,+l. Summing over allowed l yields the total degeneracy g_n=∑_{l}(2l+1)=(n+1)(n+2)/2.\nCoT-SC agent p2rh, classifying quantum states, thinking: We use the spherical solution of the 3D isotropic oscillator: states are ψ_{n_r,l,m}(r,θ,φ) with n=2n_r+l. The energy depends only on n as E_n=(n+3/2)ħω. For each n, l runs 0…n and m runs –l…l, giving degeneracy g_n=Σ_{l=0}^n(2l+1)=(n+1)(n+2)/2.; answer: The quantum states are labeled by (n,l,m_l) where n=0,1,2,… (principal), l=0,1,…,n (orbital), and m_l=–l,…,+l (magnetic). The energy depends only on n: E_n=(n+3/2)ħω. The degeneracy of the nth level is g_n=Σ_{l=0}^n(2l+1)=(n+1)(n+2)/2, because for each l there are (2l+1) m_l states.\nCoT agent 29Fn, generating energy formula, thinking: From sub-task 2 we know the energy depends only on the principal quantum number n with E_n=(n+3/2)ħω. The “nth excited state” corresponds to n (ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, etc.), so the third excited state has n=3.; answer: Energy eigenvalues: E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω. Thus the energy of the nth excited state is E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω. For the third excited state, n = 3, giving E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω.\nCoT agent wFrP, evaluating degeneracy, thinking: For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of the level with principal quantum number n is g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2. The third excited state corresponds to n=3, so g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = 10.; answer: 10\nCoT agent M5la, computing numerical energy, thinking: The energy formula is E_n=(n+3/2)ħω. For the third excited state n=3, giving E=(3+3/2)ħω=(9/2)ħω.
