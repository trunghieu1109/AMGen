This is straightforward quantum mechanics, no missing information.; answer: The system is a single particle of mass m moving in a spherically symmetric (isotropic) three‐dimensional harmonic oscillator potential V(r)=½\u2009m\u2009ω²\u2009r². Key features:\n1. Spherical symmetry allows separation of variables in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ).\n2. Wavefunctions factorize into a radial part R_{n_r,l}(r) and angular part Y_{l}^{m}(θ,φ).\n3. Quantum numbers: radial quantum number n_r=0,1,2,…; orbital angular momentum l=0,1,2,…; magnetic quantum number m=−l,…,+l.\n4. Energy eigenvalues depend only on the total principal quantum number N=2n_r+l:  E_N=ℏω(N+3/2)=ℏω(2n_r+l+3/2).\n5. Degeneracy for level N is (N+1)(N+2)/2, arising from all allowed (n_r,l,m) with 2n_r+l=N.\n6. Eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal set in three dimensions.\nCoT-SC agent s5vZ, determining energy eigenvalues, thinking: We use the well‐known result for the 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator: energy depends only on total quantum number N=2n_r+l, giving E_{n_r,l}=ħω(2n_r+l+3/2).; answer: E_{n_r,l} = ħω (2n_r + l + 3/2), where n_r=0,1,2,…, l=0,1,2,…, and N=2n_r+l so that E_N = ħω (N + 3/2).\nCoT-SC agent 8j8I, determining energy eigenvalues, thinking: For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator the energy depends only on the total number of quanta N=2n_r+l.
