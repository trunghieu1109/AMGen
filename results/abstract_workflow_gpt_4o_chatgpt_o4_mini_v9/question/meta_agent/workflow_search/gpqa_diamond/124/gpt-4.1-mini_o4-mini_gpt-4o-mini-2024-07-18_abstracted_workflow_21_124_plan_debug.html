{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3&#39;}.

### Sub-task 7: Compare the computed energy and degeneracy values with the given multiple-choice options to identify the correct answer pair. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent UHLU:
For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω. For the third excited state (n = 3), E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. The degeneracy is g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, so g_3 = (4·5)/2 = 10. This matches choice A.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Uzip:
The third excited state (n=3) has energy E=(3+3/2)ħω=(9/2)ħω and degeneracy g=(3+1)(3+2)/2=10, matching choice1 (A).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent bGWi:
For the third excited state (n=3), the energy is E=(n+3/2)ħω=(9/2)ħω and the degeneracy is g=(n+1)(n+2)/2=(4·5)/2=10, matching choice1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent SAGq:
Using the energy formula E_n=(n+3/2)ħω gives E_3=(9/2)ħω and the degeneracy formula g_n=(n+1)(n+2)/2 yields g_3=10, which corresponds to choice 1.
