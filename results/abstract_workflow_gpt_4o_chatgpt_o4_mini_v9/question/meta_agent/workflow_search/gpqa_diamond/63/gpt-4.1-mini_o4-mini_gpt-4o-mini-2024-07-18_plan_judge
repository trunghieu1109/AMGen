Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_63
proposed answer: The identities of salts A and B remain undetermined because the inert gas C is unknown and no gases were absorbed in tube №2, preventing unambiguous assignment of molecular formulas. Without precise formulas, the total number of atoms cannot be calculated.

Answer:Cannot determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the identity of the inert gas C or provide detailed decomposition pathways (which gases would be absorbed in tube №2) to establish the molecular formulas and compute the atom count.
Extracted answer: Cannot determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.
Correct answer: 2

proposed answer: The calculated total number of atoms based on a generic M2O3 plus NH4NO3 decomposition is 14, which does not match any provided option. The closest available choice is 15, but the exact metal M in salt B is unknown, preventing precise determination.

Answer:A)
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the identity of metal M in salt B or provide its full decomposition equation so that the exact formula and total number of atoms can be determined.
Extracted answer: A)
Correct answer: 2
