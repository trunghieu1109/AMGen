The problem is fully specified, so no [TOO_HARD] needed.; answer: Sub-task 1:\n1. Chemical species involved:\n   - Salts A and B (unknown formulas, equimolar mixture)\n   - Gases formed on heating: H2O vapor, O2, and gas C (remaining gas)\n2. Reagents used in gas analysis:\n   - Tube №1: anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (to absorb H2O)\n   - Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution (to absorb CO2)\n   - Tube №3: red-hot Cu (to absorb O2, forming CuO)\n3. Given quantitative data:\n   - Mass of equimolar salt mixture A + B: 7.20 g\n   - Heating conditions: 200 °C, no air\n   - Tube №1 mass increase (water absorbed): 3.60 g\n   - Tube №2 mass change: 0 g (no CO2)\n   - Tube №3 mass increase (O atoms absorbed): 0.80 g\n   - Volume of remaining gas C: 2.24 L at STP\nCoT agent SxHx, classifying reagent roles, thinking: We need to state what each tube’s reagent does—what gas or vapor it removes and by what reaction—based on standard gas analysis procedures.; answer: Sub-task 2:\nTube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂): absorbs H₂O vapor by forming hydrated perchlorate (desiccant).\nTube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution): absorbs acidic gas CO₂, forming CaCO₃ precipitate.\nTube №3 (red-hot Cu): reacts with O₂ to form CuO, thus removing oxygen.\nCoT-SC agent WFGg, deriving gas mixture composition, thinking: To find the composition of gases released on heating:\n1. Water vapor: tube 1 mass gain = 3.60 g H₂O → n(H₂O)=3.60/18=0.20 mol\n2. Oxygen: tube 3 mass gain = 0.80 g O₂ → n(O₂)=0.80/32=0.025 mol\n3. CO₂: tube 2 unchanged → n(CO₂)=0\n4. Remaining gas C: volume=2.24 L at STP → n(C)=2.24/22.4=0.10 mol\nThus the heated salts released 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol of gas C.; answer: Gas mixture composition: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.10 mol gas C.\nCoT-SC agent nTtT, deriving gas mixture composition, thinking: We calculate moles of H2O from 3.60 g absorbed by Mg(ClO₄)₂: 3.60/18=0.20 mol. Oxygen absorbed by red-hot Cu gives 0.80 g O, i.e. 0.80/16=0.05 mol O atoms =0.025 mol O₂. Remaining gas C volume 2.24 L at STP corresponds to 2.24/22.4=0.10 mol. No CO₂ was absorbed. Thus the gas mixture consists of H₂O, O₂, and gas C in those amounts.; answer: H₂O: 0.20 mol; O₂: 0.025 mol; gas C: 0.10 mol.\nCoT-SC agent LRsz, deriving gas mixture composition, thinking: From the mass increases and remaining gas volume we can calculate moles:\n– H₂O absorbed: Δm=3.60 g ⇒ n(H₂O)=3.60/18=0.20 mol\n– O₂ absorbed: Δm=0.80 g ⇒ n(O₂)=0.80/32=0.025 mol\n– Remaining gas C: V=2.24 L at STP ⇒ n(C)=2.24/22.4=0.10 mol\nNo CO₂ was absorbed (tube 2 unchanged), so the gas mixture produced on heating the salts consists of H₂O vapor, O₂, and gas C in these amounts.; answer: Gas mixture composition: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol gas C.\nCoT agent y8i0, identifying chemical formulas of salts, thinking: The gas data (0.20 mol H₂O and 0.10 mol gas C at a 2:1 ratio) match the known decomposition NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2 H₂O, so A is ammonium nitrate. The small O₂ amount (0.025 mol from 0.10 mol B) implies B decomposes via M₂O₃ → M₂O + 0.25 O₂, but no common simple salt fits this exactly. More information on B’s decomposition or its metal M is needed to unambiguously identify B.; answer: A = NH4NO3; B is a M2O3-type salt decomposing to M2O + 0.25 O2 per mole B. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the metal M or its decomposition equation to determine B.\nDebate agent rRHa, round 0, calculating total atoms, thinking: Without a specific metal M or its decomposition equation for salt B, its exact formula remains undetermined. Assuming a generic M₂O₃ gives 5 atoms (2 M + 3 O) and NH₄NO₃ gives 9 atoms (2 N + 4 H + 3 O), the total would be 14 atoms. But since salt B’s identity is unknown, this cannot be confirmed.; answer: Total atoms = 14\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the metal M or the full decomposition equation of salt B to determine its formula unambiguously.\nDebate agent nmEp, round 0, calculating total atoms, thinking: The formula of A is NH4NO3, containing 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms per formula unit. Salt B was inferred as an M2O3-type, which has 2 M + 3 O = 5 atoms per formula unit. Combined, A + B would have 9 + 5 = 14 atoms. However, because the identity of the metal M in B is not specified, the exact composition remains ambiguous and 14 is not among the provided options.; answer: 14 atoms\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the metal M in salt B or its decomposition equation to determine B’s exact formula.\nFinal Decision agent, calculating total atoms, thinking: Without knowing the specific metal M in salt B, we can only assume a generic M2O3 formula (5 atoms) combined with NH4NO3 (9 atoms) to get 14 atoms total.
