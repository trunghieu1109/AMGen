{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;15&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;13&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;17&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;19&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on total number of atoms. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent bhKh:
Without knowing the specific metal M in salt B, we can only assume a generic M2O3 formula (5 atoms) combined with NH4NO3 (9 atoms) to get 14 atoms total. However, 14 is not among the provided options, and the identity of M is essential to determine the correct atomic count.

### answer by Final Decision Agent bhKh:
14
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the identity of metal M in salt B or provide its full decomposition equation so that the exact formula and total number of atoms can be determined.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated total number of atoms with the provided answer choices (15, 13, 17, 19) and select the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
