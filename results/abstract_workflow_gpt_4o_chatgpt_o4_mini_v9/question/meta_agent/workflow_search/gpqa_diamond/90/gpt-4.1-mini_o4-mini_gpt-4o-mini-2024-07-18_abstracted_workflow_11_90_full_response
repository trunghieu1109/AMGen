The carbonyl at C-1 activates the two equivalent α-positions (C-2 and C-6) for deprotonation. Under kinetic control with a strong, bulky base like LDA at low temperature, deprotonation occurs preferentially at the less sterically hindered site, generating a discrete enolate. The enolate is stabilized by resonance between the α-carbon and the oxygen, and its geometry (E vs Z) will influence the stereochemical outcome of subsequent aldol‐type additions (e.g., with benzaldehyde).; answer: Key structural features of cyclohexanone relevant to enolate formation:\n• Six-membered ring bearing a carbonyl at C-1.\n• Two equivalent α-positions (C-2 and C-6) each with acidic protons (pKa ≈20).\n• Resonance stabilization of the enolate anion (negative charge delocalized onto oxygen).\n• Under kinetic conditions (LDA, low T), the less hindered α-proton is abstracted, favoring the less substituted enolate.\n• The resulting enolate geometry (E or Z) determines the approach to electrophiles in subsequent aldol reactions.\nCoT agent n7er, characterizing LDA, thinking: LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a very strong, sterically hindered base but a poor nucleophile. At low temperature it irreversibly deprotonates the less hindered α‐hydrogen of cyclohexanone to give the kinetic enolate, minimizing self‐condensation and side reactions. This enolate can then add to benzaldehyde in a controlled aldol‐type step.; answer: LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that, at low temperature, deprotonates cyclohexanone at its less hindered α-position to form the kinetic enolate, thus preventing self-condensation and enabling clean aldol addition to benzaldehyde.\nCoT agent K4ex, analyzing benzaldehyde features, thinking: The question asks for the key structural and reactive features of benzaldehyde that govern its behavior as an electrophile in nucleophilic addition reactions with enolates. I consider resonance effects, lack of α-hydrogens, polarization of the C=O bond, and steric factors.; answer: - Aromatic conjugation: The phenyl ring is conjugated to the carbonyl, providing resonance stabilization of the benzaldehyde but slightly reducing C=O electrophilicity compared to aliphatic aldehydes.\n- Polarized C=O bond: The carbonyl carbon bears a partial positive charge (δ+), making it a good electrophile for nucleophilic attack by enolates.\n- No α-hydrogens: Benzaldehyde cannot enolize or undergo self-aldol, ensuring cross-aldol reactions with an enolate partner are favored.\n- Planar sp2 carbonyl: Attack can occur from either face, often leading to racemic mixtures unless chiral control is applied.\n- Stabilization of intermediate: The phenyl ring can stabilize the developing alkoxide through inductive effects, facilitating the addition step.\nCoT agent 8DzU, analyzing DAST reactivity, thinking: The user asks for an analysis of DAST’s typical reactivity patterns, especially its ability to convert hydroxyls to fluorides and other fluorinations. This is straightforward organic chemistry knowledge about deoxofluorination and gem-difluoride formation under mild conditions, so no additional clarification is needed.; answer: Diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) is a versatile deoxofluorinating agent that typically converts alcohols into alkyl fluorides under mild, neutral to slightly acidic conditions. Key reactivity patterns include:\n1. Alcohol → Fluoride: Primary and secondary alcohols undergo SN2-type deoxofluorination, usually with inversion of configuration at a stereocenter.\n2. Carbonyl → Gem-Difluoride: Ketones and aldehydes react to give geminal difluorides (–CF2–) via initial formation of a difluorosulfonium intermediate.\n3. Carboxylic Acids/Esters → Acyl Fluorides or Gem-Difluorides: Carboxylic acids often form acyl fluorides, which can further react to difluoromethylene compounds under excess DAST.\n4. Epoxides → Fluorohydrins: Ring opening of epoxides delivers vicinal fluoroalcohols.\n5. Amides/Nitriles → Iminium or Fluorinated Products: Amides can be activated to imidoyl fluorides; nitriles may be converted to imidoyl fluorides or difluorinated species.\n6. Stereochemical Inversion: For chiral centers bearing hydroxyl groups, DAST typically induces inversion upon conversion to fluoride.\n7. Side Reactions: At elevated temperatures or with excess reagent, elimination, rearrangements, or cleavage can occur, so low temperatures (–78 °C to 0 °C) and controlled equivalents are recommended.\nOverall, DAST is valued for mild, selective deoxofluorination and gem-difluoride formation in complex molecular settings.\nCoT-SC agent xogj, predicting product 1, thinking: Cyclohexanone treated with LDA at low temperature gives the kinetic enolate at C2. This enolate undergoes aldol addition to benzaldehyde to form a β-hydroxy ketone after acidification. The new stereocenter at the benzylic carbon is formed without chiral induction, giving a racemic mixture. The product is a 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.; answer: 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one (racemic mixture)\nCoT-SC agent kxJg, predicting product 1, thinking: The reaction is a crossed aldol between the kinetic enolate of cyclohexanone (formed with LDA at low T) and benzaldehyde, followed by acid workup to give the β-hydroxy ketone. Using the E-enolate and a Zimmerman–Traxler chair TS, the anti diastereomer predominates. Because no chiral auxiliary is used, a racemic mixture of that anti diastereomer is obtained. ; answer: Racemic anti-2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one\nCoT-SC agent VYbz, predicting product 1, thinking: Cyclohexanone treated with LDA at –78 °C gives the kinetic enolate at C-2. That enolate attacks benzaldehyde to give a β-hydroxy ketone (an aldol adduct). Under these conditions the trans (anti) diastereomer is favored. After acid workup the product is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one, isolated as the racemic trans-diol ketone at C-1 and C-2.; answer: Product 1 is the β-hydroxy ketone 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one, predominantly the trans (anti) diastereomer formed as a racemic mixture.\nReflexion CoT agent FhPK, analyzing DAST transformation, thinking: Product 1 is a β-hydroxy ketone. DAST is known to convert secondary alcohols to fluorides via SN2 (inversion at the stereocenter) and ketones to geminal difluorides. Here, the benzylic OH (at C2) will be replaced by F (inverted configuration) and the C1 carbonyl will be converted to CF2. Since the aldol addition originally gave a racemate at C2, the resulting benzylic fluoride will remain racemic, but each enantiomer is inverted relative to its precursor. No new stereocenters are created at the CF2 carbon.; answer: Product 2 is racemic 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane: the former benzylic OH is replaced by F (with inversion) and the ketone is transformed into the gem-difluoride (CF2) at C1.\nCritic agent ROHU, providing feedback, thinking: Your mechanistic rationale is sound: DAST will convert the secondary benzylic alcohol to the fluoride with inversion and can transform the ketone into a geminal difluoride. However, in practice DAST has several limitations: it often delivers only moderate yields on hindered ketones, it can promote elimination (alkene formation) and carbocation‐induced rearrangements, and the benzylic stereocenter may epimerize under the strongly acidic conditions generated. Additionally, DAST is moisture‐ and temperature‐sensitive, requiring careful control to avoid decomposition or safety hazards.; answer: Key limitations: competing elimination and rearrangement pathways, moderate yields for ketone difluorination, potential epimerization of stereocenters, and strict reaction‐condition requirements with DAST.\nReflexion CoT agent FhPK, refining DAST transformation, thinking: DAST is known to convert secondary alcohols into alkyl fluorides via an SN2 mechanism (inverting configuration) and to transform ketones into geminal difluorides under excess reagent. Product 1 is a β-hydroxy ketone: the benzylic OH at C2 will be replaced by F with inversion of stereochemistry, and the C1 carbonyl will be converted into a CF2 group. No additional stereocenters are formed at C1, and the racemic mixture at C2 remains racemic post-inversion.; answer: Product 2 is racemic 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane: the former benzylic OH is replaced by F (inverted stereochemistry) and the ketone is transformed into a geminal difluoride at C1.\nDebate agent dpcx, round 0, comparing product 2 with choices, thinking: Product 2 is formed by conversion of the ketone at C1 into a geminal difluoride and replacement of the benzylic OH by F (via SN2 inversion).
