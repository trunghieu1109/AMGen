        "response": "The calibration curve parameters (100% efficiency, slope \u20133.3, R\u00b2=1) demonstrate that the assay itself is perfectly capable of quantification. The reversed Ct trend and consistent 0.6-cycle variation among technical replicates point to procedural errors (e.g., pipetting mistakes or sample labeling mix-ups) rather than a limitation of qPCR. Therefore, the statement that qPCR cannot be used for nucleic acid quantification is not valid.\n\nAnswer:The claim is false. qPCR can reliably quantify nucleic acids; the observed discrepancies stem from execution errors (e.g., pipetting or sample handling), not from an inherent inability of qPCR to quantify samples.",

However, each set of technical triplicates shows a deviation of about 0.6 cycles, exceeding the acceptable 0.3-cycle variation, indicating poor reproducibility. Thus choice C best explains the discrepancies.\n\nAnswer:C)",
