Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: The calibration curve parameters (100% efficiency, slope –3.3, R²=1) demonstrate that the assay itself is perfectly capable of quantification. The reversed Ct trend and consistent 0.6-cycle variation among technical replicates point to procedural errors (e.g., pipetting mistakes or sample labeling mix-ups) rather than a limitation of qPCR. Therefore, the statement that qPCR cannot be used for nucleic acid quantification is not valid.

Answer:The claim is false. qPCR can reliably quantify nucleic acids; the observed discrepancies stem from execution errors (e.g., pipetting or sample handling), not from an inherent inability of qPCR to quantify samples.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_44_92
proposed answer: The mean Ct differences between each ten-fold dilution match the expected 3.3 cycles for 100% efficiency, and the Ct values trend appropriately with copy number, ruling out choices 1 and 2. qPCR can quantify nucleic acids, ruling out choice 4. However, each set of technical triplicates shows a deviation of about 0.6 cycles, exceeding the acceptable 0.3-cycle variation, indicating poor reproducibility. Thus choice C best explains the discrepancies.
