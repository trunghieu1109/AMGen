Question: Example(question='Determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis.', choice1='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene', choice2='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene', choice3='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', choice4='4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_45_53
proposed answer: Only choice 3 (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene) provides terminal alkenes at C1 and C7 and correct substituent placement (methyls at C3/C4, isopropyl at C5) for RCM to efficiently form the desired cyclohexene.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_53
proposed answer: Ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclohexene requires alkenes separated by four intervening carbons (positions 1 and 6) and correct substituent placement (methyls at C3/C4, isopropyl at C5). Only choice 2 meets these criteria.
