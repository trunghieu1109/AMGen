Requiring Poincaré invariance automatically includes Lorentz invariance. By the CPT theorem, CPT must hold in any local Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. CP need not be conserved since SMEFT includes CP-violating operators. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (and Poincaré) symmetry and CPT, corresponding to choice 4.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent J2eZ:\nLorentz and translation invariance (together Poincaré invariance) are mandatory in SMEFT, and by the CPT theorem CPT must hold. CP can be violated. Thus the required set is 1,2,4, corresponding to choice D).\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent DSVr:\nD)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent J2eZ:\nD)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on which symmetries must be respected by all SMEFT operators and select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent xOCJ, analyzed SMEFT concept and role of symmetries, thinking: The user requests a foundational explanation of the SMEFT and the role of symmetries in constraining its operators. They did not ask for a multiple-choice selection here, so I will provide a descriptive answer. No missing information that would trigger a [TOO_HARD] response.; answer: Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model in which one systematically adds higher-dimensional operators built from Standard Model fields. These operators encode the effects of heavy new physics at a scale Λ well above the electroweak scale. Each operator of dimension d\u2009>\u20094 is suppressed by (1/Λ^{d−4}), so SMEFT provides a model-independent expansion in powers of 1/Λ.\n\nSymmetries play a central role in determining which operators are allowed:\n1. Lorentz (or more precisely Poincaré) symmetry dictates that all operators must be constructed to form Lorentz tensors (scalars under rotations and boosts, or appropriate spinor/tensor structures).\n2. The gauge symmetries SU(3)_C\u2009×\u2009SU(2)_L\u2009×\u2009U(1)_Y of the Standard Model must be respected, so operators must be singlets under these.\n3. Global accidental symmetries of the SM (such as baryon and lepton number) may be respected or broken depending on the operator dimension; baryon- or lepton-number violating operators only appear at dimension six or higher.\n4. CPT symmetry follows from the underlying assumptions of locality, unitarity, and Lorentz invariance, so all SMEFT operators respect CPT.\n5. CP symmetry is not automatically preserved by SMEFT operators—it may be violated by certain coefficients if the underlying UV physics breaks CP.\n\nIn summary, every operator in the SMEFT must satisfy Poincaré (Lorentz) invariance, the SM gauge invariances, and CPT symmetry; CP invariance need only hold if one assumes no new sources of CP violation.\nCoT-SC agent qMir, defined symmetries, thinking: The user requests definitions for Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries, building on SMEFT context. This is straightforward and well-posed, so no [TOO_HARD] marker is needed.; answer: Lorentz Symmetry: Invariance under rotations and boosts of spacetime coordinates. Mathematically, fields transform under the Lorentz group SO(1,3) via representations labeled by spin. Operators must be constructed as Lorentz scalars (or appropriate tensors/spinors) so that the action is unchanged under x^μ→Λ^μ_ν x^ν.\n\nPoincaré Symmetry: Extension of Lorentz symmetry to include spacetime translations. It is the group ISO(1,3)=SO(1,3)⋉ℝ^4. Fields transform as ϕ(x)→D(Λ)ϕ(Λ^{-1}(x−a)), with Λ a Lorentz transform and a a four‐vector translation. Operators must commute with the Poincaré generators (momentum P^μ and Lorentz M^{μν}).\n\nCP Symmetry: Discrete symmetry combining charge conjugation (C), which swaps particles with antiparticles, and parity (P), which flips spatial coordinates x→−x. In QFT, C acts via ϕ→ϕ^C (changing internal charge labels), and P acts via ϕ(t, x)→η_P Γ\u2009ϕ(t, −x), where Γ is a spinor/tensor matrix and η_P a phase. CP\u2009:\u2009ϕ(t, x)→η_{CP}\u2009Γ\u2009ϕ^C(t, −x). CP can be violated by complex couplings.\n\nCPT Symmetry: Fundamental theorem in any local, Lorentz‐invariant, unitary QFT dictates invariance under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Under T: t→−t, fields transform with an antiunitary operator. CPT acts as ϕ(t, x)→η_{CPT} Γ\u2009ϕ†(−t, −x), guaranteeing identical masses and lifetimes for particles and antiparticles.\nCoT-SC agent iraw, defined symmetries, thinking: We need to provide clear definitions of each of the four symmetries—Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT—emphasizing their physical meaning and mathematical form in QFT/EFT.; answer: Lorentz symmetry: The invariance of a theory under transformations among inertial frames that leave the spacetime interval ds^2 = g_{μν}dx^μdx^ν unchanged. Mathematically, fields transform under representations of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group SO^+(3,1) or its double cover SL(2,C), with coordinates x^μ → Λ^μ{}_ν x^ν and spinors/tensors by corresponding matrices D(Λ). Operators must be singlets or appropriate tensors/spinors under these transformations.\n\nPoincaré symmetry: The full symmetry of flat spacetime including Lorentz transformations plus translations x^μ → Λ^μ{}_ν x^ν + a^μ. The group generators are the momentum operators P^μ (translations) and the Lorentz generators M^{μν}. In QFT, the action must commute with all Poincaré generators, ensuring energy–momentum conservation and covariance under rotations, boosts, and translations.\n\nCP symmetry: A discrete symmetry combining charge conjugation C (which swaps particles with their antiparticles, reversing charges and internal quantum numbers) and parity P (which inverts spatial coordinates x → –x). Under CP, a field φ(t,x) transforms as φ(t,x) → η_C\u2009η_P\u2009φ^†(t,–x) (up to phase factors η). A CP-invariant theory has a Hamiltonian H satisfying [H,CP]=0.\n\nCPT symmetry: A fundamental theorem in any local, Lorentz-invariant, unitary QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. CPT is the combined operation of charge conjugation C, parity inversion P, and time reversal T (t→–t). Under CPT, fields obey φ(t,x) → η_CPT\u2009φ^†(–t,–x). CPT invariance guarantees equal masses and lifetimes for particles and antiparticles and is automatically respected by all operators in a properly constructed effective field theory.\nCoT-SC agent 6M6B, defined symmetries, thinking: The user requests definitions of four symmetries with physical meaning and mathematical formulation. This is straightforward given standard QFT/EFT knowledge, no missing info.; answer: Lorentz symmetry: The invariance of a theory under rotations and boosts that leave the spacetime interval ds^2=η_{μν}dx^μdx^ν invariant. Mathematically, fields transform under representations of the Lorentz group SO(1,3) via generators J_{μν} satisfying [J_{μν},J_{ρσ}] = i(η_{μρ}J_{νσ} – η_{μσ}J_{νρ} + η_{νσ}J_{μρ} – η_{νρ}J_{μσ}). In QFT, Lagrangian densities must be scalars under these transformations.\n\nPoincaré symmetry: The full spacetime symmetry including Lorentz transformations and translations x^μ→x^μ + a^μ. The group ISO(1,3) has generators P_μ (translations) and J_{μν} (Lorentz), with algebra [P_μ,P_ν]=0, [J_{μν},P_ρ]=i(η_{νρ}P_μ–η_{μρ}P_ν). Poincaré invariance ensures energy–momentum conservation and Lorentz invariance.\n\nCP symmetry: The combined action of charge conjugation (C), which swaps particles with their antiparticles and reverses internal charges, and parity (P), which flips spatial coordinates x→(−x^i). Under P: ψ(t,x)->γ^0ψ(t,−x), F^{0i}→−F^{0i}, F^{ij}→F^{ij}. Under C: ψ→C(ψ̄)^T, gauge fields A^μ→−A^{μT}. CP invariance means the Lagrangian is unchanged by the combined transformation.\n\nCPT symmetry: The combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time-reversal (T: t→−t, with fields transforming antiunitarily). The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant, unitary QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is invariant under CPT. Mathematically, an antiunitary operator Θ implements CPT such that Θ\u2009φ(x)\u2009Θ^{-1} = η\u2009φ†(−x), ensuring CPT invariance of all physical processes.\nCoT agent qOAh, evaluated Lorentz and Poincare symmetries necessity, thinking: In a relativistic quantum field theory defined on Minkowski spacetime one must demand invariance under the full Poincaré group (spacetime translations plus Lorentz transformations).  Since Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of Poincaré symmetry, insisting on Poincaré invariance automatically enforces Lorentz invariance.  The SMEFT is constructed as a local, unitary, Lorentz‐ and translation‐invariant effective Lagrangian built from Standard Model fields, so neither Lorentz nor Poincaré invariance can be violated without losing relativity, locality, or unitarity.; answer: Both Lorentz symmetry and Poincaré symmetry are strictly required for all SMEsFT operators.  In practice one imposes Poincaré invariance of the Lagrangian (which includes Lorentz invariance and translation invariance), ensuring that every operator in the SMEFT respects both.\nCoT agent tFSN, evaluated CP and CPT symmetries necessity, thinking: The SMEFT is built as a local, Lorentz‐invariant, unitary EFT, so CPT invariance follows from the CPT theorem and must hold for all operators. CP, however, is an empirical symmetry that can be broken, and SMEFT explicitly includes CP-violating higher-dimensional operators, so CP need not be respected by all operators.; answer: CP symmetry is not required to be respected by all SMEFT operators; SMEFT includes CP-violating operators. CPT symmetry, by the CPT theorem in any local Lorentz-invariant QFT, must be respected by all SMEFT operators.\nDebate agent DSVr, round 0, synthesizing final answer, thinking: The SMEFT is constructed as a local, unitary, Lorentz‐ and translation‐invariant effective field theory.
