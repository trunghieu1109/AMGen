This is straightforward to provide without extra data.; answer: Lorentz symmetry: Invariance of the laws of physics under rotations and boosts (changes of inertial reference frame). Physically, it ensures that measured quantities do not depend on an observer’s constant velocity or orientation. In SMEFT, operators must be constructed from fields contracted into Lorentz scalars (or tensors transforming appropriately) to preserve this symmetry.\n\nPoincaré symmetry: The full spacetime symmetry group combining Lorentz transformations with translations in space and time. It guarantees homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime plus the principle of relativity. In quantum field theory and SMEFT, this enforces conservation of energy–momentum and angular momentum, and requires operators to be invariant under spacetime shifts and rotations/boosts.\n\nCP symmetry: The combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), swapping particles with antiparticles, and parity (P), inverting spatial coordinates. Physically, CP relates processes to their mirror–antimatter counterparts. While the Standard Model violates CP in the weak sector, one can classify SMEFT operators by their CP properties; CP-odd operators describe new sources of CP violation beyond the SM.\n\nCPT symmetry: The combined operations of C, P, and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under CPT. In SMEFT, CPT invariance follows automatically from the assumptions of locality and Lorentz invariance, ensuring properties like identical masses and lifetimes for particles and antiparticles.\nCoT agent ckRt, clarifying Lorentz vs Poincare, thinking: The question asks for the relation between Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry in SMEFT and whether both must be imposed separately. Poincaré already contains Lorentz plus translations, so requiring Poincaré invariance suffices to guarantee Lorentz invariance. I’ll explain that and note practical usage.; answer: Poincaré symmetry is the full spacetime symmetry group combining Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) with translations in space and time. Since Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of Poincaré, any operator invariant under the full Poincaré group automatically respects Lorentz invariance. In the SMEFT one therefore imposes invariance under the entire Poincaré group – this simultaneously enforces both Lorentz invariance and translation invariance. In practice one still labels operators by their Lorentz properties, but there is no need to impose Lorentz symmetry separately once Poincaré symmetry is required.\nReflexion CoT agent ZDDG, reviewing SMEFT symmetries, thinking: From sub-tasks 1 and 2 we see that Poincaré invariance (translations plus Lorentz) is imposed on all SMEFT operators, which automatically enforces Lorentz invariance. The CPT theorem then guarantees CPT is an exact symmetry of any local, Lorentz‐invariant EFT. By contrast CP is only an approximate symmetry in the SM and need not be preserved by SMEFT operators—indeed CP‐odd operators parameterize new sources of CP violation.; answer: All operators in SMEFT must exactly respect Poincaré symmetry (hence Lorentz invariance) and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not required and can be violated (CP‐odd operators are allowed).\nCritic agent OD7r, feedback on symmetry review, thinking: The classification is correct: Poincaré/Lorentz and CPT are exact symmetries of the SMEFT, while CP (and C or P separately) need not be preserved and can be violated by higher-dimensional operators.; answer: All SMEFT operators must be invariant under Poincaré symmetry (which includes Lorentz invariance) and must respect CPT by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry is not imposed—CP-odd operators are allowed—as are violations of C or P individually. Accidental global symmetries (e.g., baryon or lepton number) are likewise not guaranteed and can be broken by higher-dimensional terms.\nReflexion CoT agent ZDDG, refining symmetry review, thinking: From sub-tasks 1 and 2 we see that Poincaré invariance (including Lorentz invariance) is imposed on all SMEFT operators. The CPT theorem then guarantees that any local, Lorentz‐invariant EFT must also be CPT invariant. By contrast CP is only approximately conserved in the SM and higher‐dimensional operators in the SMEFT can introduce new CP violation, so CP need not be respected by all operators.; answer: All SMEFT operators must exactly respect Poincaré symmetry (and hence Lorentz invariance) and must be invariant under CPT. CP symmetry, however, is only approximate in the Standard Model and may be violated by SMEFT operators (CP-odd operators are allowed).\nCoT-SC agent cJJF, evaluating SMEFT symmetries, thinking: SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré invariance (which includes Lorentz invariance) and, by the CPT theorem for local Lorentz-invariant EFTs, CPT invariance. CP is only approximate and can be violated. Therefore mandatory symmetries are Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT.; answer: D)\nCoT-SC agent kC0p, evaluating SMEFT symmetries, thinking: The SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz‐invariant effective field theory with Poincaré symmetry (including translations and Lorentz transformations) built in. By the CPT theorem, any such local Lorentz‐invariant theory is automatically CPT invariant. CP symmetry, however, is only approximate in the SM and SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation, so CP is not required to hold for all operators.; answer: Lorentz invariance (1), Poincaré invariance (2), and CPT invariance (4) must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\nCoT-SC agent wsyL, evaluating SMEFT symmetries, thinking: Poincaré invariance (which includes Lorentz invariance) and the CPT theorem apply to any local, Lorentz‐invariant effective field theory, so all SMEFT operators must respect these exact symmetries.
