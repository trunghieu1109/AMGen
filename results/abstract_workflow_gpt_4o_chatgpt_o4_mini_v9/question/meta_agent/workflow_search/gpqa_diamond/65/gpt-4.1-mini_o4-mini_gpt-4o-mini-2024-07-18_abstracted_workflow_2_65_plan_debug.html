{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4.

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Synthesize the evaluations from Sub-tasks 3 and 4 to determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, and map this conclusion to the provided multiple-choice options to identify the correct choice. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent DSVr:
The SMEFT is constructed as a local, unitary, Lorentz‐ and translation‐invariant effective field theory. Requiring Poincaré invariance automatically includes Lorentz invariance. By the CPT theorem, CPT must hold in any local Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. CP need not be conserved since SMEFT includes CP-violating operators. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (and Poincaré) symmetry and CPT, corresponding to choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent J2eZ:
Lorentz and translation invariance (together Poincaré invariance) are mandatory in SMEFT, and by the CPT theorem CPT must hold. CP can be violated. Thus the required set is 1,2,4, corresponding to choice D).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent DSVr:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent J2eZ:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on which symmetries must be respected by all SMEFT operators and select the correct multiple-choice option.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>SMEFT is built as a local, unitary, Poincaré‐invariant QFT, which by construction respects Lorentz and translation invariance (i.e. Poincaré symmetry). By the CPT theorem any such theory also respects CPT. CP need not be preserved since SMEFT accommodates CP‐violating operators. Hence the required set is 1,2,4, corresponding to choice D).
