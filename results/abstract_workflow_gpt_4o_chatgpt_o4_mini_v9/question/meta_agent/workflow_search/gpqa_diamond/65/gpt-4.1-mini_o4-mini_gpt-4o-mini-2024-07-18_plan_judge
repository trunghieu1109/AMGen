Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_65
proposed answer: SMEFT is built as a local, unitary, Poincaré‐invariant QFT, which by construction respects Lorentz and translation invariance (i.e. Poincaré symmetry). By the CPT theorem any such theory also respects CPT. CP need not be preserved since SMEFT accommodates CP‐violating operators. Hence the required set is 1,2,4, corresponding to choice D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_14_65
proposed answer: SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincaré (2) invariance and, by the CPT theorem, CPT symmetry (4); CP symmetry (3) can be violated. The only choice listing 1,2,4 is choice 4.
