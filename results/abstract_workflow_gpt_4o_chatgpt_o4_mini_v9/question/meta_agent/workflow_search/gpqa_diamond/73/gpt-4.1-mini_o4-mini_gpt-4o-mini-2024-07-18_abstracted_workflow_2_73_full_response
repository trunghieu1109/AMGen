The given 32% decay probability over 100 min is the CDF value P(T≤100)=0.32, which determines the rate parameter λ. No information is missing for classification.; answer: Sub-task 1:\n• Scenario: single-atom radioactive decay with continuous, memoryless behavior.\n• Distribution: exponential.\n• Given probability: P(T ≤ 100 min) = 0.32 implies CDF F(100)=1–e^(–λ·100)=0.32, so λ = –ln(0.68)/100.\n• Elapsed time: survival for 50 min uses memoryless property for subsequent probabilities.\nCoT-SC agent NV5v, extracting decay rate, thinking: We have P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32 for an exponential distribution with rate λ, so 1 – e^(–λ·100) = 0.32. Solve for λ: e^(–λ·100) = 0.68 → –λ·100 = ln(0.68) → λ = –ln(0.68)/100.; answer: The decay constant λ = –ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 per minute.\nCoT-SC agent M8d1, extracting decay rate, thinking: To find the decay constant λ for an exponential distribution given P(T ≤ 100)=0.32, we use the CDF: F(t)=1–e^(–λt). So 1–e^(–λ·100)=0.32 ⇒ e^(–λ·100)=0.68 ⇒ –λ·100=ln(0.68) ⇒ λ=–ln(0.68)/100.; answer: λ = –ln(0.68) / 100 ≈ 0.00386 per minute\nCoT-SC agent C4xc, extracting decay rate, thinking: We know for an exponential distribution P(T ≤ t)=1–e^(–λt). Given P(T ≤ 100)=0.32 ⇒ 1–e^(–100λ)=0.32 ⇒ e^(–100λ)=0.68 ⇒ –100λ=ln(0.68) ⇒ λ=–ln(0.68)/100.; answer: λ = –ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 per minute\nCoT agent LwkD, evaluating conditional decay probability, thinking: We have an exponential distribution with decay constant λ = –ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 per minute. By the memoryless property, P(decay in next 150\u2009min | survive 50\u2009min) = P(T ≤ 150) = 1 – e^(–λ·150) ≈ 1 – e^(–0.00386·150) ≈ 1 – e^(–0.579) ≈ 0.44 (44%).; answer: 44%\nDebate agent lOdJ, round 0, comparing and selecting closest choice, thinking: The calculated conditional probability is 44%, which matches choice3.
