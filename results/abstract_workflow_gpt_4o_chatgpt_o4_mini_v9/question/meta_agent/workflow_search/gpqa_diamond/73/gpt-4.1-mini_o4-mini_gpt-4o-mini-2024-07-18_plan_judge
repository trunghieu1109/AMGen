Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_73
proposed answer: Using the memoryless property of exponential decay, the conditional probability is P = 1 - exp(-λt) with λ derived from 32% in 100 min: λ ≈ -ln(0.68)/100. For the next 150 min the probability ≈ 1 - 0.68^(150/100) ≈ 43.9%, matching choice C).
