{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;52%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;48%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;44%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;40%&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the computed conditional decay probability with the provided answer choices (52%, 48%, 44%, 40%) and select the closest matching option. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 0kzX:
We computed the conditional decay probability using the memoryless property as approximately 44%, which directly matches choice C).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 9Ml4:
The conditional probability is approximately 43.9%, which corresponds to 44%, matching choice C).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent sYOv:
We computed the conditional probability as approximately 44%, and among the provided options (52%, 48%, 44%, 40%), 44% is the closest match.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent LxLW:
We computed P ≈ 44%, which matches choice3 (44%) most closely.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 0kzX:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 9Ml4:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent sYOv:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent LxLW:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on the closest matching answer choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Using the memoryless property of exponential decay, the conditional probability is P = 1 - exp(-λt) with λ derived from 32% in 100 min: λ ≈ -ln(0.68)/100. For the next 150 min the probability ≈ 1 - 0.68^(150/100) ≈ 43.9%, matching choice C).
