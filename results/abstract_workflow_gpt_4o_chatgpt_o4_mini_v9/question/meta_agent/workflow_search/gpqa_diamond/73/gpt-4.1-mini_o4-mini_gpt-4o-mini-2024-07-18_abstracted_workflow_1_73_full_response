No additional information is missing.; answer: This problem is a conditional probability application of the memoryless property of exponential decay: P(decay in next 150\u2009min | survival up to 50\u2009min).\nCoT agent bwly, deriving decay model, thinking: We’re given P(decay ≤100\u2009min)=0.32 for an exponential process. No missing info; we can solve for λ and write the model directly.; answer: Decay model: P(decay by time t)=1–e^(–λ\u2009t), with 0.32=1–e^(–λ·100) ⇒ e^(–100λ)=0.68 ⇒ λ=–ln(0.68)/100≈0.0038566\u2009min⁻¹. Thus P(t)=1–exp(–0.0038566\u2009t).\nCoT agent 06pv, calculating decay rate lambda, thinking: We know for an exponential process P(T≤100)=1−e^{−λ·100}=0.32, so e^{−100λ}=0.68. Solving gives λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.0038566\u2009min⁻¹.; answer: λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 min⁻¹\nCoT agent G4gM, computing survival probability, thinking: We use the exponential survival function S(t)=e^(−λt) with λ≈0.0038566\u2009min⁻¹. For t=50\u2009min, exponent=−0.0038566×50≈−0.19283, so S(50)=e^(−0.19283)≈0.825.; answer: Survival probability up to 50\u2009min: S(50)=e^(−0.0038566×50)≈0.825 (82.5%).\nCoT agent 7dLv, calculating conditional decay probability, thinking: Using the memoryless property of exponential decay, we have\nP(decay in next 150\u2009min | survived 50\u2009min) = 1 – exp(–λ·150)\nwith λ ≈ 0.0038566\u2009min⁻¹.
