This triggers a MAPK cascade leading to G1 cell cycle arrest and polarized growth. Mating-specific gene promoters become transcriptionally active, undergoing chromatin remodeling (histone acetylation, recruitment of chromatin remodelers) and assembly of transcription machinery. Therefore, active chromatin in shmoo cells is enriched for transcription factors like Ste12, Mediator, the pre-initiation complex (general transcription factors and RNA Pol II), histone-modifying enzymes, and nucleosome components bearing active histone marks. DNA replication machinery such as the pre-replication complex is downregulated during G1 arrest and thus absent from active chromatin.; answer: Yeast cells treated with the quorum-sensing peptide activate the mating pheromone response, leading to G1 arrest, polarized growth (shmoo), and transcriptional induction of mating genes. The active chromatin proteome will be enriched for histone marks of transcriptional activation, nucleosome histones, chromatin remodelers, enhancer-binding proteins (e.g., Ste12), Mediator, and the pre-initiation complex (TFIIs and RNA Pol II), while pre-replication complex components will be absent.\nCoT-SC agent elUk, characterizing active chromatin, thinking: Active chromatin at mating-specific promoters in shmoo‐forming yeast is characterized by histone acetylation, nucleosome remodeling and assembly of transcription machinery, whereas DNA replication factors are absent due to G1 arrest.; answer: Active chromatin in shmoo‐forming yeast is typically associated with: 1) nucleosome histone complexes bearing active marks (e.g. H3K9ac, H4ac), 2) histone‐modifying and chromatin‐remodeling complexes (e.g. SAGA, SWI/SNF), 3) site‐specific transcription factors and enhancer‐binding proteins (e.g. Ste12/Mcm1), 4) the Mediator complex, 5) the pre‐initiation complex (general transcription factors TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH plus RNA Pol II), and 6) transcription elongation factors (e.g. FACT, Paf1).\nCoT-SC agent YWlu, characterizing active chromatin, thinking: Shmoo formation in S. cerevisiae reflects activation of the mating pheromone response, G1 arrest, and recruitment of transcriptional machinery at mating gene promoters. Active chromatin in this state will be enriched for histone modifications that mark transcriptionally active regions, nucleosome components, chromatin remodelers, general transcription factors, Mediator, and RNA Pol II, but not DNA replication factors.; answer: Active chromatin isolated by ChIP from shmoo-forming yeast will be characterized by: 1. Nucleosome histone complexes bearing active marks (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K9ac) 2. Histone-modifying enzymes and readers (e.g., Gcn5 acetyltransferase, SWI/SNF-associated bromodomain proteins) 3. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (e.g., SWI/SNF, RSC) 4. Sequence-specific transcription factors bound at enhancers (e.g., Ste12) 5. The Mediator complex bridging activators and Pol II 6. Pre-initiation complex components (TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH) and RNA polymerase II 7. Coactivator complexes (e.g., SAGA, NuA4) These factors collectively mark and drive transcriptionally active chromatin in shmoo-stage cells.\nCoT-SC agent CFVf, characterizing active chromatin, thinking: Sub-task 1 established that shmoo formation reflects G1 arrest and transcriptional activation of mating genes. Active chromatin at these loci is remodeled (histone acetylation), bound by nucleosomal histones bearing active marks, and engaged by the transcription machinery. ChIP–MS of active chromatin will therefore recover both histone complexes with active PTMs and the full complement of coactivator and transcription complexes at promoters and enhancers of mating genes.; answer: Active chromatin in shmoo‐forming yeast will be characterized by: 1. Nucleosome/histone complexes bearing active marks (e.g. H3K9ac, H3K4me3). 2. General transcription machinery assembled as the pre‐initiation complex (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH) plus RNA Pol II. 3. Coactivator complexes such as Mediator and SAGA (histone acetyltransferase activity). 4. Chromatin‐remodeling complexes like SWI/SNF and FACT that evict or reposition nucleosomes. 5. Sequence‐specific transcription factors and enhancer complexes (e.g. Ste12 at mating gene enhancers). 6. Transcription‐elongation factors (PAF complex) and mRNA‐capping enzymes recruited to elongating Pol II. These are the protein assemblies you would recover by ChIP–MS of active chromatin in shmoo-induced cells.\nReflexion CoT agent 7BPR, reviewing ChIP-MS principles, thinking: ChIP-MS recovers proteins directly or indirectly crosslinked to specific chromatin regions. In active regions one typically sees nucleosome histones, histone modifiers and remodelers, sequence-specific TFs and enhancer complexes, Mediator and the pre-initiation complex (TFIIs + Pol II), plus elongation factors. In contrast, replication complexes (ORC, Cdc6, MCMs) are only at origins in S or late G1 and won’t be enriched at active promoters. This recapitulates the outputs from Sub-task 2.; answer: ChIP-MS principles: crosslink chromatin, fragment, IP with factor or mark, mass-spec identification. Typical complexes recovered:\n1) Nucleosome histone complexes (H3/H4, active marks)\n2) Histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes (e.g. SAGA, SWI/SNF)\n3) Sequence-specific enhancer and promoter TF complexes (e.g. Ste12/Mcm1)\n4) Mediator complex\n5) Pre-initiation complex (TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH + RNA Pol II)\n6) Transcription elongation factors (FACT, Paf1)\n7) Replication complexes (ORC, Cdc6, MCM2-7) appear only at origins in G1/S, not at active promoters\nCritic agent g6oe, providing feedback, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) is a powerful way to profile proteins associated with defined genomic regions, but it has several important limitations:\n1. Crosslinking biases: The efficiency and specificity of formaldehyde (or other) crosslinkers vary by protein and local chromatin context, so some interactions are under- or over-represented.\n2. Direct vs. indirect interactions: ChIP-MS cannot unambiguously distinguish proteins that bind DNA directly from those that associate indirectly via multi-protein assemblies.\n3. Antibody specificity and efficiency: The success of the IP step depends on using a highly specific, high-affinity antibody; off-target pull-down or inefficient enrichment can skew results.\n4. Sensitivity to low-abundance factors: Transient or low-stoichiometry interactions are often below the detection threshold, especially in the presence of highly abundant chromatin proteins.\n5. Requirement for large input material: Achieving sufficient peptide yield for MS often requires many millions of cells, making it difficult to apply to rare cell types or limited clinical samples.\n6. Dynamic/temporal resolution: ChIP-MS provides a population average and limited temporal resolution; rapid or cell-cycle-dependent interactions can be missed.\n7. Quantitative accuracy: Co-purifying contaminants and variable peptide ionization efficiencies can complicate quantitative comparisons between conditions.; answer: ChIP-MS’s main drawbacks are crosslinking and antibody biases, inability to resolve direct versus indirect binding, poor sensitivity for transient or low-abundance factors, high input requirements, and limited temporal and quantitative accuracy.\nReflexion CoT agent 7BPR, refining review, thinking: ChIP-MS captures proteins crosslinked to specific chromatin regions by formaldehyde (or other crosslinkers), fragments chromatin, immunoprecipitates with an antibody against a target (e.g., a histone mark or DNA-binding factor), and identifies co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry. It recovers both direct DNA binders and proteins recruited via multi-protein assemblies. At transcriptionally active promoters and enhancers, one typically recovers nucleosome histones (with active marks), histone‐modifying and remodeling complexes (e.g. SAGA, SWI/SNF), sequence‐specific transcription factors and enhancer complexes (e.g. Ste12/Mcm1 in yeast), the Mediator complex, the pre-initiation complex (TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH plus RNA Pol II), and elongation factors (e.g. FACT, Paf1). In contrast, replication complexes (ORC, Cdc6, MCM2-7) are only enriched at replication origins in G1/S and are typically absent from active promoter/enhancer ChIPs.; answer: Principles of ChIP-MS:\n1. Crosslink (e.g. formaldehyde) proteins to DNA in vivo.\n2. Fragment chromatin by sonication or nucleases.\n3. Immunoprecipitate with a specific antibody (targeting a histone mark or factor).\n4. Reverse crosslinks, digest proteins to peptides, and identify them by mass spectrometry.\n\nTypical complexes recovered:\n- Nucleosome histone complexes (H3/H4, active histone marks)\n- Histone‐modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes (SAGA, SWI/SNF)\n- Sequence-specific transcription factors/enhancer complexes (e.g. Ste12/Mcm1)\n- Mediator complex\n- Pre-initiation complex (TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH + RNA Pol II)\n- Transcription elongation factors (FACT, Paf1)\n- Replication complex components (ORC, Cdc6, MCM2-7) are only seen when targeting origins during G1/S and are not enriched at active promoter/enhancer ChIPs.\nCoT-SC agent E2aT, evaluating detection likelihood, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) of active chromatin in shmoo-forming yeast will enrich proteins directly bound at or recruited to transcriptionally active regions. The pre-initiation complex (general transcription factors\u2009+\u2009RNA Pol II) and nucleosome histones with active marks are integral to active promoters and should be robustly detected. Sequence-specific enhancer proteins (e.g. Ste12/Mcm1 in pheromone response) are also recruited to active regulatory regions and will be recovered. In contrast, pre-replication complexes (ORC, Cdc6, MCM2-7) assemble at origins during G1/S but are not stably associated with actively transcribed chromatin in shmoo cells, so they will be absent or present at background levels.; answer: pre-initiation complex: high likelihood of detection\npre-replication complex: low likelihood of detection\nenhancer protein complex: high likelihood of detection\nnucleosome histone complex: very high likelihood of detection\nCoT-SC agent phik, evaluating detection likelihood, thinking: ChIP-MS of active chromatin in shmoo‐forming yeast will recover proteins directly bound to or recruited at active promoters/enhancers. Nucleosomes (with active marks) and pre‐initiation complexes assemble at active promoters and are robustly detected. Sequence‐specific transcription factors and enhancer complexes at mating‐pathway response elements will also be enriched. In contrast, pre‐replication complexes are only assembled at origins in G1/S and are not part of active transcription chromatin, making them unlikely to be recovered.; answer: Pre-initiation complex: Highly likely to be detected\nPre-replication complex: Unlikely to be detected\nEnhancer protein complex: Likely to be detected\nNucleosome histone complex: Highly likely to be detected\nCoT-SC agent eDrt, evaluating detection likelihood, thinking: ChIP-MS captures proteins bound to or recruited at active chromatin regions. In shmoo-forming yeast (active mating response), one expects robust transcription and enhancer activity at mating genes, so nucleosomes with active marks, transcription initiation machinery, and enhancer-bound factors are enriched. Pre-replication complexes load only at origins during G1/S and are not associated with active promoters/enhancers, so they will be least recovered.; answer: Likelihood of detecting each complex in active chromatin of shmoo-forming yeast:\n\n• Pre-initiation complex: High likelihood. Active promoters recruit TFIID, TFIIA–H, and RNA Pol II as part of transcription initiation.\n• Pre-replication complex: Low likelihood. ORC, Cdc6, and MCM2-7 load at replication origins in G1/S, not at active mating promoters.\n• Enhancer protein complex: High likelihood. Sequence-specific factors (e.g. Ste12/Mcm1) and Mediator assemble at upstream activating sequences during mating response.\n• Nucleosome histone complex: High likelihood. Histones (H3/H4) with active marks remain core to chromatin and are immunoprecipitated when targeting active regions.\nDebate agent W5qh, round 0, identifying least likely complex, thinking: The pre-replication complex is assembled at origins of replication during G1/S and is not stably associated with actively transcribed chromatin in shmoo-forming yeast, so it is least likely to be recovered by ChIP-MS of active chromatin.; answer: B)\nDebate agent zfc0, round 0, identifying least likely complex, thinking: ChIP-MS of active chromatin will enrich transcription-related and regulatory complexes (pre-initiation, enhancer proteins, histone nucleosomes) but not replication initiation machinery, which associates with origins during G1/S rather than active transcription sites.
