Using cos²θ=(1+cos2θ)/2 gives V=(5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ, showing a quadrupole angular dependence.  In Cartesian coords x=r cosθ, y=r sinθ, this becomes V=2k x² + ½k y².  Thus the system is an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m), and only C₂ (π) rotational symmetry and reflections.  It is suited for quantum treatment as two independent 1D oscillators: H= p_x²/2m + ½m ω_x² x² + p_y²/2m + ½m ω_y² y².; answer: Express V in Cartesian form:  V(x,y)=2k x² + ½k y².  Equivalently, H= p_x²/(2m) +½m(2√(k/m))² x² + p_y²/(2m) +½m(√(k/m))² y², i.e. two decoupled harmonic oscillators with ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m).\nCoT-SC agent xdcT, classifying potential terms, thinking: We need to identify radial vs angular parts and apply cos^2θ identity. The given V has an isotropic r² part and an angular-dependent r²cos²θ part. Using cos²θ=(1+cos2θ)/2 separates constant and angular pieces.; answer: The potential splits into:\n1) An isotropic radial term ∝r²: (1/2)k r²\n2) An anisotropic angular term ∝r²cos²θ: (3/2)k r² cos²θ\nUsing the identity cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2 gives\nV(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r²·(1+cos2θ)/2\n        = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ\nCoT-SC agent 7vBS, classifying potential terms, thinking: We need to identify the r-dependent and θ-dependent parts of V, then use cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2 to simplify.; answer: The potential has an isotropic radial term ½ k r² and an anisotropic angular term (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Using the identity cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2 gives\nV(r,θ) = ½ k r² + (3/2) k r² × (1+cos2θ)/2\n          = ½ k r² + 3/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ\n          = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ\nThis separates into a purely radial part (5/4 k r²) and an angular modulation (3/4 k r² cos2θ).\nCoT-SC agent OqPs, classifying potential terms, thinking: We identify two contributions: an isotropic radial term and an angular‐dependent anisotropic term.  By applying the identity cos²θ=(1+cos2θ)/2 one can split out an angle‐independent part and a cos2θ part.; answer: Classification:\n- Radial term (isotropic): (1/2) k r²\n- Angular-dependent term (anisotropic): (3/2) k r² cos²θ\nUsing cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2:\nV(r,θ) = 1/2 k r² + 3/2 k r²·(1+cos2θ)/2 = 5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ\nCoT agent 0UjO, transforming potential to separable terms, thinking: To separate variables, express cos²θ = x²/r² so that r²cos²θ = x². Substitute into V(r,θ) = ½k(x²+y²) + 3/2k x² to get a sum of independent x- and y-dependent terms, each quadratic in coordinate.; answer: V(x,y) = ½k(x²+y²) + 3/2k x² = 2k x² + ½k y² = ½(4k)x² + ½(k)y². Thus the motion separates into two independent harmonic oscillators with effective spring constants 4k (along x) and k (along y). The corresponding angular frequencies are ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).\nCoT agent UBFY, extracting spring constants and frequencies, thinking: From the separated potential V(x,y)=½(4k)x²+½(k)y², the coefficients of x² and y² give the effective force constants. Then ω=√(k_eff/m).; answer: Effective spring constants: k_x=4k, k_y=k. Corresponding angular frequencies: ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m).\nDebate agent Hc50, round 0, evaluating energy eigenvalues, thinking: We have two decoupled oscillators with ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).
