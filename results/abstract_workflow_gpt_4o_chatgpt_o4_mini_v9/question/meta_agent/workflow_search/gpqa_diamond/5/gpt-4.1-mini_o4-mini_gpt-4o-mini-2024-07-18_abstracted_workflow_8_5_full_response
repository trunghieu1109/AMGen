Thus V(r,θ)=½kr² + 3/2 k r² (x²/r²)=½k(x²+y²)+3/2 k x²=2k x²+½k y².; answer: Sub-task 1 answer:\n\nIn polar form:\nV(r,θ)=½ k r² + 3/2 k r² cos²θ.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates (x= r cosθ, y= r sinθ):\nV(x,y)=2 k x² + (k/2) y².\nCoT-SC agent xyF8, identifying effective spring constants, thinking: We have V(x,y)=2k x^2 + (k/2) y^2. Comparing to the standard form V=½ k_x x^2 + ½ k_y y^2 gives k_x/2=2k ⇒ k_x=4k, and k_y/2=k/2 ⇒ k_y=k.; answer: k_x = 4k, k_y = k\nCoT-SC agent 8JMP, identifying effective spring constants, thinking: We have V(x,y)=2k x^2 + (k/2) y^2.  A standard 1D harmonic potential is V=(1/2)k_eff x^2, so equate coefficients: 2k = (1/2)k_x ⇒ k_x=4k; (k/2) = (1/2)k_y ⇒ k_y=k.; answer: Effective spring constant in x-direction: k_x = 4k. Effective spring constant in y-direction: k_y = k.\nCoT-SC agent FEtQ, identifying effective spring constants, thinking: We have V(x,y)=2k x^2 + (k/2)y^2. Comparing to V = 1/2 k_eff x^2 gives k_eff_x = 4k. Similarly, V = 1/2 k_eff y^2 gives k_eff_y = k.; answer: The effective spring constants are k_x = 4k and k_y = k.\nCoT agent xFvZ, writing Hamiltonian and determining frequencies, thinking: From sub-task 2 we have k_x=4k and k_y=k. The general 2D anisotropic oscillator Hamiltonian is H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + ½ k_x x^2 + ½ k_y y^2, which can also be written as H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + ½ m ω_x^2 x^2 + ½ m ω_y^2 y^2. The angular frequencies follow from ω_i = sqrt(k_i/m).; answer: H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + ½ k_x x^2 + ½ k_y y^2 = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + 2k x^2 + (k/2) y^2. In oscillator form: H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + ½ m ω_x^2 x^2 + ½ m ω_y^2 y^2, with ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2√(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m).\nCoT agent 7yLU, deriving energy eigenvalues, thinking: For a separable 2D harmonic oscillator the total energy is the sum of energies in each independent direction: E=(n_x+1/2)ħω_x+(n_y+1/2)ħω_y.
