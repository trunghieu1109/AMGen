Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_172
proposed answer: The calculated uncertainty ΔE ≃1.06×10^−16 J is closest to the option ~10^(−16) J, corresponding to choice3.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_12_172
proposed answer: The calculated uncertainty in energy ΔE is ~1×10^(-16) J, which exactly matches choice C. The next closest options (D, B, A) are off by factors of 10, 10^2, and 10^3 respectively. Thus the best answer is C.
