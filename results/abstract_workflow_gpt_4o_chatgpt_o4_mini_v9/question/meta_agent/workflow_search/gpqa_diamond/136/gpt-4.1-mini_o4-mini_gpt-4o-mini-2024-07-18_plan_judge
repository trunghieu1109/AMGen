proposed answer: Using the rough estimate N ≃ T₁/(e·U₀·cosΦ₀) ≃ 950 MeV/(190 keV·cos(π/4)) ≃ 7074 turns, none of the provided choices match exactly. The closest available option is D) 5300, but without the RF frequency modulation law ν(α)(t) or the exact relation between revolution period and energy, the exact turn count cannot be determined.

Answer:D)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the RF frequency modulation ν(α)(t) or the relation between revolution period and turn number for an exact summation of phase-dependent energy gains.
