A planet with Earth’s mass and radius would therefore have the same density.; answer: Approximately 5.51 g/cm^3\nCoT agent 6XrI, identifying density of 2 Earth mass planet, thinking: Choice b explicitly states a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.; answer: Approximately 5.5 g/cm^3\nCoT agent MasV, calculating density for 5 Earth mass planet, thinking: For Earth-like composition planets, radius scales roughly as R ∝ M^0.27. Thus for M = 5 M⊕, R ≈ R⊕·5^0.27 ≈ 1.55 R⊕, so volume ≈ 1.55^3 ≈ 3.72 V⊕. Density ∝ M/V ≈ 5/3.72 ≈ 1.34 times Earth's (5.51 g/cm³), giving ≈7.4 g/cm³.; answer: Approximately 7.4 g/cm³\nCoT agent kLLR, calculating density for half Earth mass planet, thinking: We use the mass–radius relationship for Earth‐like rocky planets: R≈R⊕(M/M⊕)^0.27. For M/M⊕=0.5, R/R⊕≈0.5^0.27≈0.83. Density scales as (M/M⊕)/(R/R⊕)^3×ρ⊕. So ρ≈0.5/0.83^3×5.51\u2009g/cm³≈4.9\u2009g/cm³.; answer: Approximately 4.9 g/cm³.\nDebate agent wmGl, round 0, comparing densities and selecting highest, thinking: Calculated densities: a) ~5.51 g/cm^3, b) ~5.5 g/cm^3, c) ~7.4 g/cm^3, d) ~4.9 g/cm^3.
