Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_9
proposed answer: Based on computed densities—Earth-like at 1 M⊕ ~5.51 g/cm³ (a), 2 M⊕ at ~5.5 g/cm³ (b), 5 M⊕ Earth composition ~7.4 g/cm³ (c), 0.5 M⊕ ~4.9 g/cm³ (d)—the 5 M⊕ Earth-composition planet (choice c) has the highest density.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_9
proposed answer: We compare the four options’ densities: a) Earth-like: 5.51 g/cm³; b) 2 M⊕ at 5.5 g/cm³; c) 5 M⊕ Earth-composition: ~7.6 g/cm³; d) 0.5 M⊕ Earth-composition: ~4.8 g/cm³. The highest density is option c.
