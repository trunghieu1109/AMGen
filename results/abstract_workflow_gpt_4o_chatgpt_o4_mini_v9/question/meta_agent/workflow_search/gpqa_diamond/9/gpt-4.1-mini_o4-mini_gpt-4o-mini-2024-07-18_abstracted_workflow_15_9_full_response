For M = 5\u2009M⊕, R ≈ 5^0.27 ≈ 1.54\u2009R⊕. Volume scales as R^3 ≈ 1.54^3 ≈ 3.65\u2009V⊕. Density = M/V ≈ 5/3.65 ≈ 1.37 times Earth’s density. Multiplying Earth’s 5.51\u2009g/cm³ by 1.37 gives ≈7.6\u2009g/cm³.; answer: The density of the 5-Earth-mass planet (choice c) is approximately 7.6 g/cm³.\nCoT-SC agent yOyK, calculating density for 5 Earth mass planet, thinking: For an Earth-like composition planet, the mass–radius relation scales roughly as R∝M^0.27. For M=5 M⊕, R≈5^0.27 R⊕≈1.54 R⊕. Density scales as ρ∝M/R^3, so ρ≈5/(1.54^3)×ρ⊕≈1.36×5.51 g/cm³≈7.5 g/cm³.; answer: 7.5 g/cm³\nCoT-SC agent Z92x, calculating density for 5 Earth mass planet, thinking: For an Earth-like composition, the mass–radius relation scales as R∝M^0.27. For M=5\u2009M⊕, R≈5^0.27≈1.54\u2009R⊕. Volume scales as R^3≈(1.54)^3≈3.67\u2009V⊕. Density ρ=Mass/Volume≈5/3.67 times Earth's density (5.51\u2009g/cm³)≈1.362×5.51≈7.5\u2009g/cm³.; answer: Approximately 7.5 g/cm³\nCoT-SC agent uh70, calculating density for half Earth mass planet, thinking: We estimate the radius of a half‐Earth‐mass rocky planet using the empirical mass–radius relation for Earth‐like composition: R ∝ M^0.27. For M = 0.5 M⊕, R ≈ 0.5^0.27 ≈ 0.81 R⊕. Then density ρ = M/R^3 ≈ 0.5/(0.81^3) × 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 5.18 g/cm³.; answer: Approximately 5.2 g/cm³\nCoT-SC agent z13v, calculating density for half Earth mass planet, thinking: We assume an Earth-like rocky mass–radius relation: R ∝ M^0.27. For M = 0.5 M⊕, R ≈ 1×(0.5)^0.27 ≈ 0.83 R⊕. Density scales as ρ ∝ M/R^3, so ρ = 5.51×(0.5)/(0.83^3) ≈ 5.51×0.877 ≈ 4.83 g/cm³.; answer: ≈4.8 g/cm³\nCoT-SC agent FuR4, calculating density for half Earth mass planet, thinking: To estimate the density of an Earth‐composition planet with half Earth’s mass, use the mass–radius relation for rocky worlds: R≈M^0.27 (in Earth units). For M=0.5\u2009M⊕, R≈0.5^0.27≈0.83\u2009R⊕. Volume scales as R^3≈0.83^3≈0.57, so density ρ=0.5\u2009M⊕/0.57\u2009V⊕≈0.88\u2009ρ⊕.
