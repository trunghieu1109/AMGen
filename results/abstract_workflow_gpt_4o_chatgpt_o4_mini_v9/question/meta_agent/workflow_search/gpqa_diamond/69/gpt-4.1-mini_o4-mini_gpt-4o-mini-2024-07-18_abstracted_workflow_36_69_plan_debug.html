{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C2v&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;D4h&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;D∞h&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Analyze the molecular structure of product E to identify its symmetry elements and classify its molecular symmetry group, using the information about E&#39;s formation and chemical nature derived from previous subtasks. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pKr6:
Assuming E is phosgene (COCl₂), its geometry is planar (sp² at carbon) with two identical Cl substituents and one O. It has a C₂ axis through C that swaps the Cl atoms, a mirror plane in the molecular plane, and a perpendicular mirror plane bisecting the Cl–C–Cl angle, giving point group C₂ᵥ.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pKr6:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the identified molecular symmetry group of E with the provided choices (C2, C2v, D4h, D∞h) to select the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
