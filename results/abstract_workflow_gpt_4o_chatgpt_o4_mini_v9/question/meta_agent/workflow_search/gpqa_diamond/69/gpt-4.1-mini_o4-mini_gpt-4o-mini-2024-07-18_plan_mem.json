        "The validated molecular symmetry group of E is C2v. Limitations of this assignment: (1) Assumes a rigid, static molecular geometry and neglects vibrational distortions that can break ideal symmetry. (2) Does not account for potential low\u2010temperature or condensed\u2010phase symmetry lowering. (3) Ignores possible fluxional or dynamic behavior in solution or gas phase that could transiently alter symmetry. (4) Does not consider coupling between vibrational modes that may split degenerate states.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
