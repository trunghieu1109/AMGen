proposed answer: The assigned molecular symmetry group C2v for E (thionyl chloride, SOCl2) matches its trigonal pyramidal geometry with a C2 principal axis and two vertical mirror planes, its known high reactivity with water (forming SO2 and HCl), its extreme hazard and liquid‐phase behavior, and the reaction scheme describing its formation from C and D. Limitations include the idealized static model that ignores vibrational distortions, low‐temperature symmetry lowering, dynamic fluxional behavior in solution or gas phase, and possible coupling of vibrational modes that can lift degeneracies.

Answer:The validated molecular symmetry group of E is C2v. Limitations of this assignment: (1) Assumes a rigid, static molecular geometry and neglects vibrational distortions that can break ideal symmetry. (2) Does not account for potential low‐temperature or condensed‐phase symmetry lowering. (3) Ignores possible fluxional or dynamic behavior in solution or gas phase that could transiently alter symmetry. (4) Does not consider coupling between vibrational modes that may split degenerate states.
