Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_31
proposed answer: The calculated energy (20.0052 GeV) differs from the choices by: |18.475–20.0052|≈1.5302, |20.132–20.0052|≈0.1268, |23.069–20.0052|≈3.0638, |21.419–20.0052|≈1.4138. The smallest difference is with 20.132 GeV.
