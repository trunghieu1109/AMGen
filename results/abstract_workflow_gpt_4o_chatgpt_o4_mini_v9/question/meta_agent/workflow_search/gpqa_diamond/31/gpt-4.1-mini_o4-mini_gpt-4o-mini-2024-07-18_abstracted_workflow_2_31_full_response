Lithium’s atomic number Z=3 (3 protons). Given 3 neutrons, mass number A=Z+N=3+3=6. Total nucleons=6. The rest mass of 6Li nucleus ≃6.015122\u2009u ×931.494\u2009MeV/u ≃5601.5\u2009MeV/c².; answer: Z = 3; N = 3; A = 6; Rest mass ≃6.015122\u2009u (≈5601.5\u2009MeV/c²)\nCoT-SC agent BNoO, calculating Lorentz factor gamma, thinking: The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = 1/√(1 − v²/c²). For v = 0.96c, 1 − v²/c² = 1 − 0.9216 = 0.0784, √0.0784 = 0.28, so γ ≈ 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.; answer: Lorentz factor γ ≈ 3.5714\nCoT-SC agent 4swB, calculating Lorentz factor gamma, thinking: To find the Lorentz factor γ for v=0.96c: γ=1/√(1−β²) with β=0.96.

Using the atomic mass of 6.0151223\u2009u gives m₀c²≈5.6025\u2009GeV, so E≈3.5714×5.6025\u2009GeV≈20.132\u2009GeV, matching choice 2.; answer: 20.132 GeV\nReflexion CoT agent xPCH, refining relativistic energy, thinking: Using rest mass from Sub-task 1: m0c2 ≃6.015122\u2009u×931.494\u2009MeV/u ≃5601.5\u2009MeV=5.6015\u2009GeV and γ≃3.5714, so E=γ\u2009m0c2≃3.5714×5.6015\u2009GeV≃20.0052\u2009GeV (precision 1×10⁻⁴).; answer: Total relativistic energy E ≃20.0052 GeV\nDebate agent lO94, round 0, comparing energies, thinking: The calculated relativistic energy is 20.0052 GeV.
