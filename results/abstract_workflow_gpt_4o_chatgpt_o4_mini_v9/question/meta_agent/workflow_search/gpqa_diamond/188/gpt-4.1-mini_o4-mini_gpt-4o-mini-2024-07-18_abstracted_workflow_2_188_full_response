A skyrmion is a topological soliton (stable field configuration), not itself a Goldstone mode, so it is not directly associated with symmetry breaking in the sense of Goldstone’s theorem.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7VnS:\nMagnon: Yes – Goldstone boson of broken spin-rotation symmetry.\nSkyrmion: No – a topological soliton, not a Goldstone excitation of a broken symmetry.\nPion: Yes – (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD.\nPhonon: Yes – Goldstone boson of broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Based on the analysis in Sub-task 3, identify which of the given particles is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, thereby answering the original question. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Omvj (yourself):\nFrom Sub-task 3, magnons, pions, and phonons arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes of broken continuous symmetries, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone excitations of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Omvj (yourself):\nB)\n\n### Please review the identification of the particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry and provide its limitations. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent YNMY:\nIdentifying the skyrmion as the only listed particle not arising as a (pseudo-)Goldstone mode is correct. However, this classification has caveats: 1) Skyrmions themselves require an underlying spontaneously broken symmetry (e.g. in a ferromagnet or chiral Lagrangian) even though they are topological solitons rather than gapless excitations. 2) The question implicitly assumes continuous symmetries—if discrete symmetries or explicit breaking are included, the distinction can blur. 3) In finite or lattice systems, translational invariance is broken, affecting phonon status, and likewise finite-size effects modify skyrmion properties. 4) Pions are only pseudo-Goldstone bosons due to quark masses, so the notion of “spontaneously broken” is approximate.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the analysis in Sub-task 3, identify which of the given particles is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, thereby answering the original question.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent ubAh, defining spontaneously-broken symmetry, thinking: The user requests a clear definition of spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics and what it means for a particle or quasiparticle to be associated with such symmetry breaking. This is straightforwardly answerable without missing information, so no [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: In physics, a spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the fundamental equations (or Lagrangian) of a system are invariant under some symmetry transformation, but the lowest-energy state (the vacuum or ground state) does not share that full symmetry. Key points:\n1. Symmetry of the laws vs. symmetry of the ground state: Although the underlying Hamiltonian or Lagrangian remains symmetric, the chosen ground state ‘‘picks’’ one of many equivalent configurations, breaking the symmetry in practice.\n2. Order parameter: A measurable quantity (e.g., magnetization in a ferromagnet) that is zero when the symmetry is unbroken and nonzero when broken.\n3. Degenerate vacua: There are multiple equivalent ground states related by the broken symmetry transformations.\n4. Goldstone’s theorem: For each broken continuous symmetry, there is a massless excitation (Goldstone boson) corresponding to fluctuations along the degenerate ground-state manifold.\n\nA particle or quasiparticle is said to be associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry when it arises as a low-energy excitation due to that breaking. Specifically, if the broken symmetry is continuous, the corresponding excitation is a Goldstone mode. Examples:\n• Magnon: Goldstone boson of broken spin-rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet.\n• Phonon: Goldstone boson of broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n• Pion: Pseudo-Goldstone boson of (approximate) chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics.\n\nThus, being ‘‘associated with’’ spontaneously-broken symmetry means the existence and properties of that particle/quasiparticle directly stem from the order parameter fluctuations around a symmetry-broken ground state.\nCoT agent XzuN, describing particles, thinking: The user requests descriptions of four quasiparticles/particles. This is straightforward based on standard condensed-matter and particle physics knowledge. No missing info or excessive complexity requiring a [TOO_HARD] flag.; answer: Nature and physical origin of each given particle/effective particle:\n\n1) Magnon:\n- Nature: A bosonic quasiparticle representing a quantized spin wave.\n- Physical origin: Collective excitation of aligned electron spins in a magnetically ordered material (e.g. a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet). When spins precess coherently around their equilibrium directions, the perturbation propagates as a wave, whose quanta are magnons.\n\n2) Skyrmion:\n- Nature: A topologically protected, particle-like field configuration (soliton) rather than a fundamental particle.\n- Physical origin: Arises in nonlinear sigma models and certain magnetic materials with chiral interactions (Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya). Spins wrap around the sphere configuration in real space, creating a stable, localized knot of magnetization.\n\n3) Pion:\n- Nature: A light pseudoscalar meson, fundamental in low-energy hadron physics.\n- Physical origin: Bound state of an up/down quark and antiquark in Quantum Chromodynamics. Appears as an (approximate) Nambu–Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD.\n\n4) Phonon:\n- Nature: A bosonic quasiparticle representing a quantized normal mode of lattice vibrations.\n- Physical origin: Arises from collective oscillations of atoms in a crystalline solid. The continuous translational symmetry of the underlying atomic lattice is broken to a discrete group, and quantizing these vibrations yields phonons.\nCoT-SC agent 7VnS, determining association with spontaneously-broken symmetry, thinking: By comparing each excitation to the definition of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry (Goldstone’s theorem: gapless mode from order-parameter fluctuations), we see that magnons, pions, and phonons are Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) bosons of broken spin rotation, chiral, and translational symmetries respectively.

Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from approximate chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons—stable field configurations—rather than Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry, so they are not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same sense.; answer: Magnon: Yes\nSkyrmion: No\nPion: Yes\nPhonon: Yes\nCoT-SC agent FwQ4, determining association with spontaneously-broken symmetry, thinking: We compare each particle/quasiparticle’s origin to the definition of spontaneously-broken symmetry: if it arises as a (pseudo-)Goldstone mode of a broken continuous symmetry, it’s associated; otherwise not.
