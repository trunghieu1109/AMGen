Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_188
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotation, chiral, and translational, respectively). A skyrmion, by contrast, is a topological soliton configuration rather than a gapless excitation arising from symmetry breaking, so it is not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry in the Goldstone sense.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_188
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin-rotational, chiral, and translational, respectively), whereas a skyrmion is a topological soliton rather than a Nambuâ€“Goldstone excitation. Therefore the skyrmion is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.
