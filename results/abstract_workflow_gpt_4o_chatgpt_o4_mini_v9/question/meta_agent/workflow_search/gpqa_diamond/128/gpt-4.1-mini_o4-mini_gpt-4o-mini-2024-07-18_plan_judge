Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_128
proposed answer: The IR shift to ~1715 cm⁻¹ and the unstrained six-membered ring requirement match 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. None of the other options fit both ring size and substitution pattern.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_48_128
proposed answer: Compound A is identified as 1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one (IR ~1750 cm⁻¹). The sequence HCN addition, reduction, and diazotization with N₂ loss induces a 1,2-alkyl shift expanding the five-membered ring to a six-membered ring. The IR shift to ~1715 cm⁻¹ confirms formation of a cyclohexanone. The methyl substituents originally at C1 and C2 in A end up at C3 and C4 in the six-membered ring. Among the options, only 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one matches this pattern.
