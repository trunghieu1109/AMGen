Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_68
proposed answer: We need a spatial resolution at least as good as the minimum decay length (~6.7×10⁻⁷ m). Among the options, only 2.08×10⁻⁹ m is smaller than this, hence sufficient to observe 30% of decays.

proposed answer: The calculated minimum resolution is L≈6.8×10⁻⁷ m. Comparing factors relative to this value: option C (2.08×10⁻⁶ m) is a factor ≃3× the target (|3–1|=2), while B (2.08×10⁻⁹ m) is ≃0.003× (|0.003–1|≈0.997). Thus C is closest.
