### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on minimum decay length needed to observe at least 30% of decays. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent RiAX:
To observe 30% of decays within distance x, solve 1−exp(−x/L)=0.3 ⇒ x=−L ln 0.7. With L≈1.88×10^−6 m, −ln 0.7≈0.3567, giving x≈1.88×10^−6×0.3567≈6.7×10^−7 m.

### answer by Final Decision Agent RiAX:
Minimum decay length needed to observe at least 30% of decays is approximately 6.7×10^−7 m.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated minimum decay length (L_min) with the provided multiple-choice options to identify the correct resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We need a spatial resolution at least as good as the minimum decay length (~6.7×10⁻⁷ m). Among the options, only 2.08×10⁻⁹ m is smaller than this, hence sufficient to observe 30% of decays.
