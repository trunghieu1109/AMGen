The intact sequence begins with ATG (positions 1–3) encoding methionine, marking translation start. Breaking the next bases into codons gives the amino‐acid context of the first exon.; answer: Sub-task 1: The intact sequence 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ begins with ATG (positions 1–3), the start codon for methionine. In the first exon, the reading frame is: ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATA (Ile), TTT (Phe), ATT (Ile), GTC (Val)… with the stop codon TGA appearing later.\nCoT-SC agent HX2M, comparing mutants to intact gene, thinking: To compare each mutant to the intact sequence, I aligned codons 1–6 (positions 1–18) and noted substitutions/deletions relative to the start at ATG. I then classified each change as synonymous, missense, nonsense or frameshift.; answer: Sub-task 2:\nMutant 1:\n  • Codon 2 (positions 4–6): original TTT→TTC (Phe→Phe; synonymous).\n  • Codon 3 (7–9): original CTC→TAC (Leu→Tyr; missense).\n  • No stop or frameshift; likely still produces full-length enzyme (though Tyr substitution).\nMutant 2:\n  • Codon 2 (4–6): TTT→TTC (synonymous).\n  • Codon 3 (7–9): CTC→TAA (Leu→stop; nonsense at codon 3).\n  • Early termination expected; enzyme nonfunctional.\nMutant 3:\n  • Codon 3 (7–9): CTC→TAC (Leu→Tyr; missense).\n  • Codon 6 (16–18): ACT→GTC (Thr→Val; missense).\n  • Two amino-acid changes; no premature stop.\nMutant 4:\n  • Deletion of GGT (codon 5, positions 13–15) shifts reading frame.\n  • Frameshift from codon 6 onward; premature stop likely downstream.\n  • Strongly expected to abolish enzyme function.\nCoT-SC agent O3XK, comparing mutants to intact gene, thinking: To compare each mutant to the intact sequence, I aligned the first nine codons and noted nucleotide positions relative to the ATG start (nt 1–3). I then recorded each change with its nucleotide position and effect on the codon and amino acid.; answer: Mutant 1: Codon 2 (nt 4–6) TTT→TTC (nt 6: T→C; silent Phe→Phe), Codon 3 (nt 7–9) CTC→TAC (nt 7: C→T; nt 8: T→A; Leu→Tyr missense)\nMutant 2: Codon 2 TTT→TTC (nt 6: T→C; silent), Codon 3 CTC→TAA (nt 7: C→T; nt 8: T→A; nt 9: C→A; Leu→Stop nonsense)\nMutant 3: Codon 3 CTC→TAC (nt 7: C→T; nt 8: T→A; Leu→Tyr missense), Codon 6 (nt 16–18) ACT→GTC (nt 16: A→G; nt 17: C→T; nt 18: T→C; Thr→Val missense)\nMutant 4: Codon 3 CTC→TAC (nt 7: C→T; nt 8: T→A; Leu→Tyr missense), Codon 5 (nt 13–15) GGT→ACT (nt 13: G→A; nt 14: G→C; nt 15: T→T; Gly→Thr missense)\nCoT-SC agent aze7, comparing mutants to intact gene, thinking: We aligned each mutant to the intact first‐exon sequence (codons 1–?): ATG(1) TTT(2) CTC(3) GCT(4) GGT(5) ACT(6)…\nMutant 1 has three single‐base changes in codons 2, 3, and the Arg codon at the tail—two silent and one missense (Leu→Tyr). Mutant 2 converts codon 3 to TAA, giving a premature stop. Mutant 3 has two missense changes (Leu→Tyr at codon 3; Thr→Val at codon 6). Mutant 4 retains the codon 3 missense (Leu→Tyr) and adds another missense at codon 5 (Gly→Thr).; answer: Mutant 1: position 6 T→C in codon 2 (Phe→Phe, silent), positions 7 C→T and 8 T→A in codon 3 (CTC→TAC, Leu→Tyr), plus end‐of‐exon CGT→CGC (Arg→Arg, silent).\nMutant 2: same T→C at pos 6; codon 3 CTC→TAA (positions 7 C→T, 8 T→A, 9 C→A), creating a premature stop at amino acid 3.\nMutant 3: codon 3 CTC→TAC (Leu→Tyr; pos 7 C→T, 8 T→A), and codon 6 ACT→GTC (Thr→Val; pos 16 A→G, 17 C→T, 18 T→C).\nMutant 4: codon 3 CTC→TAC (Leu→Tyr) as above, and codon 5 GGT→ACT (Gly→Thr; pos 13 G→A, 14 G→C, 15 T→T).\nReflexion CoT agent QGR5, determining mutation effects, thinking: I aligned each mutant sequence to the intact sequence, identified codon changes, and classified each as synonymous, missense, nonsense, or frameshift based on whether they introduce amino acid changes, stop codons, or reading‐frame shifts.; answer: Mutant 1: missense mutation; Mutant 2: nonsense mutation (premature stop codon); Mutant 3: missense mutations; Mutant 4: frameshift mutation\nCritic agent r2fc, providing feedback, thinking: The classifications for Mutants 1–3 are correct, but Mutant 4 does not introduce a frameshift. It retains the reading frame and only changes codons, so it is also a missense mutation.; answer: Mutant 1: missense mutation; Mutant 2: nonsense mutation (premature stop codon); Mutant 3: missense mutation; Mutant 4: missense mutation\nReflexion CoT agent QGR5, refining mutation effect analysis, thinking: I reviewed the nucleotide changes in each mutant relative to the intact first‐exon coding sequence. I identified codon alterations and determined whether they change the amino acid without altering the frame (synonymous), substitute one amino acid for another (missense), introduce an in‐frame stop codon (nonsense), or shift the reading frame (frameshift). Upon re‐evaluation, Mutant 4 retains the reading frame but changes codons, so it is a missense mutation, not a frameshift.; answer: Mutant 1: missense mutation (Leu→Tyr)\nMutant 2: nonsense mutation (premature stop at codon 3)\nMutant 3: missense mutations (Leu→Tyr and Thr→Val)\nMutant 4: missense mutation (in‐frame codon changes)\nDebate agent vfxq, round 0, arguing for Pro-Mutant 1, thinking: Among the four mutants, only Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the coding sequence, effectively truncating the protein and disrupting its function. The others are missense mutations and unlikely to abolish activity completely.; answer: Mutant 2\nDebate agent vMQU, round 0, arguing for Pro-Mutant 2, thinking: Premature stop codons early in the coding sequence are most effective at abolishing protein function. Only Mutant 2 introduces a nonsense mutation at codon 3, causing an early termination. The other mutants cause only missense changes and are unlikely to fully disrupt synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.; answer: Mutant 2\nDebate agent nl8C, round 0, arguing for Pro-Mutant 3, thinking: Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon in exon 1 very early in the coding sequence, which would truncate the protein and abolish its function. None of the other mutants cause early stop codons or frameshifts, so Mutant 2 is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.; answer: Mutant 2\nDebate agent DfQk, round 0, arguing for Pro-Mutant 4, thinking: Only a mutation causing a premature stop early in the coding region will effectively abolish protein function. From the sub‐task 3 analysis, only Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at codon 3. The others are missense changes in‐frame and unlikely to fully eliminate the enzyme activity.; answer: Mutant 2\nFinal Decision agent, deciding best mutation, thinking: Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the first exon, leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein and effectively abolishing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.
