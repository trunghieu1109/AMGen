The question is self-contained and can be answered without further decomposition.; answer: Particle content and quantum numbers:\n- N_{iR}: three right-handed singlet fermions, transforming as (1,1,0) under SU(3)_c×SU(2)_L×U(1)_Y.\n- S: an inert scalar doublet, transforming as (1,2,1), with U(1)_Y hypercharge +1.\n- φ: a real scalar singlet, transforming as (1,1,0).\n- H: the SM Higgs doublet, (1,2,1).\n\nLagrangian terms:\n- i \x7fn_{R}\x7fgamma^μ∂_μN_{R}: kinetic term for the singlet fermions.\n- ½(∂^μφ)^2: kinetic term for the real singlet scalar φ.\n- |D^μS|^2: kinetic and gauge interactions for the scalar doublet S.\n- -½ y_i φ \x7fN_{iR}^cN_{iR}^c + h.c.: a Majorana‐type Yukawa coupling; when φ obtains a VEV, it generates Majorana masses M_{N_i}=y_i x for the singlet fermions.\n- -g_{iα} \x7fN_{iR}L_{α}S + h.c.: Yukawa coupling between N_{R}, the SM lepton doublets L_α, and the inert scalar S; responsible for radiative generation of light neutrino masses.\n- -V(φ,S,H): the scalar potential containing all allowed self- and cross-couplings among φ, S, and the SM Higgs H.\n\nVacuum expectation values (VEVs):\n- ⟨φ⟩=x: breaks any global symmetry under which φ is charged, generates Majorana masses for N_{iR}.\n- ⟨H⟩=v=246 GeV: the usual SM Higgs VEV, which breaks SU(2)_L×U(1)_Y to U(1)_em and gives masses to W, Z, and SM fermions.\n\nRole of fields:\n- N_{iR}: heavy singlet fermions that, after acquiring Majorana masses from φ, enter loop diagrams to generate light neutrino masses.\n- S: an inert doublet that does not acquire a VEV; its charged and neutral components propagate in loops and can be a dark matter candidate.\n- φ: a singlet whose VEV triggers spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry that protects the pseudo‐Goldstone boson H_2, and sets the scale of the heavy neutrino masses.\nCoT-SC agent in8K, classifying scalar physical states, thinking: To identify physical scalar states, one diagonalizes the mass matrix in the (h, φ) basis after both acquire VEVs. The result is two CP-even eigenstates H₁ and H₂, plus would-be Goldstone bosons eaten by W and Z, and the inert doublet components (H⁺, H⁻, H⁰, A⁰).\n\nH₁ is the mostly-h state (SM-like Higgs), and H₂ is the mostly-φ state. In the limit of an exact global symmetry on φ, H₂ would be massless (true Goldstone). With a small explicit breaking, radiative corrections give H₂ a small mass, making it a pseudo-Goldstone mode.; answer: After ⟨h⟩=v and ⟨φ⟩=x, the CP-even scalars mix. One finds two mass eigenstates,\n\nH₁ ≃ cos\u2009θ·h + sin\u2009θ·φ  (SM-like Higgs, M≈125\u2009GeV)\nH₂ ≃ −sin\u2009θ·h + cos\u2009θ·φ  (pseudo-Goldstone, predominantly φ)\n\nThe inert doublet S yields a charged pair H⁺,H⁻ and two neutral states H⁰ (CP-even) and A⁰ (CP-odd). H₂ is light because in the limit of an exact global symmetry φ→φ+const it would be massless; small breaking (e.g. loops) makes it a pseudo-Goldstone boson.\nCoT-SC agent 04ED, classifying scalar physical states, thinking: After SSB the neutral CP-even components of H (h field) and φ mix, yielding two mass eigenstates: the lighter SM‐like Higgs H₁ and the singlet‐like pseudo‐Goldstone H₂. Because φ’s VEV breaks the approximate global symmetry, the orthogonal combination to the true Goldstone acquires a small mass radiatively and is identified as H₂. Its composition is mostly φ with a small h admixture controlled by the mixing angle α ≃ (λ_{Hφ} v x)/(m_φ²−m_h²).; answer: The neutral scalar sector consists of two CP-even states \n• h₁ ≃ cosα·h + sinα·φ (SM‐like Higgs, mass ∼125\u2009GeV)\n• h₂ ≃ −sinα·h + cosα·φ (pseudo‐Goldstone boson)\nHere α is the mixing angle fixed by the off‐diagonal entry ∝λ_{Hφ}v x in the scalar‐mass matrix. h₂ is mostly the singlet φ direction and remains light (pseudo‐Goldstone) because its mass arises only via radiative/global‐symmetry–breaking effects.\nCoT-SC agent tP6Z, classifying scalar physical states, thinking: After symmetry breaking, the real components of the SM Higgs doublet H and the singlet φ develop VEVs v and x, respectively.  Writing H=(G^+, (v+h'+iG^0)/√2) and φ=x+φ', the two CP-even fields h' and φ' mix through the scalar potential.  Diagonalizing the 2×2 mass matrix yields two mass eigenstates: the SM‐like Higgs h₁≈h' with m≈125\u2009GeV, and the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂≈φ' which is massless at tree level (it would be an exact Goldstone if the global symmetry were exact).  Radiative corrections from loops of W, Z, top, heavy neutrinos, and inert scalars lift H₂ and give it a small mass.  The SM Goldstone modes G^0 and G^± are eaten by Z and W^±.  The inert doublet S, having no VEV, yields physical states H^±, H^0 (CP‐even), and A^0 (CP‐odd) that do not mix with h' or φ'.; answer: After SSB the scalar spectrum is:\n\n1) Two CP‐even mixtures of (h',φ'):\n   • h₁≈h' (SM‐like Higgs, m≈125\u2009GeV)\n   • H₂≈φ' (pseudo‐Goldstone boson, massless at tree‐level, acquires small radiative mass)\n\n2) SM Goldstones G⁰, G^± from H (eaten by Z and W^±)\n\n3) Inert‐doublet scalars (from S): charged H^±, neutral CP‐even H^0, neutral CP‐odd A^0 (no VEV, do not mix with h', φ').\nCoT agent mB8s, extracting radiative corrections, thinking: Sub-task 3 asks to isolate the loop contributions entering the pseudo-Goldstone mass.  From the Coleman–Weinberg potential one finds quartic mass-dependence for bosons (positive) and fermions (negative), each weighted by an αi.  We therefore identify each sector’s term and assemble them into the standard 1/(8π²(x²+v²)) prefactor.; answer: The one‐loop radiative correction to m_{H₂}² picks up contributions from:  \n  • CP-even SM Higgs h₁:  +α₁\u2009M_{h₁}⁴  \n  • W bosons:             +α₂\u2009M_W⁴  \n  • Z bosons:             +α₃\u2009M_Z⁴  \n  • charged scalars H±:    +α₅\u2009M_{H±}⁴  \n  • neutral inert H⁰:       +α₆\u2009M_{H⁰}⁴  \n  • inert pseudoscalar A⁰: +α₇\u2009M_{A⁰}⁴  \n  • top quark t:           –α₄\u2009M_t⁴  \n  • singlet fermions N_i:  –α₈\u2009∑_i\u2009M_{N_i}⁴  \nPutting these together gives the approximate mass²  \n  m_{H₂}² ≃ 1/[8π² (x²+v²)]  { α₁M_{h₁}⁴ + α₂M_W⁴ + α₃M_Z⁴ + α₅M_{H±}⁴ + α₆M_{H⁰}⁴ + α₇M_{A⁰}⁴ – α₄M_t⁴ – α₈ ∑_iM_{N_i}⁴ }\nCoT agent ksk3, evaluating mass correction formula structure, thinking: The sub-task asks to describe the generic structure of the one-loop mass correction: it follows from the Coleman–Weinberg potential and scales as 1/(8π²(x²+v²)) times the sum over particle masses to the fourth power, with positive signs for bosonic loops and negative for fermionic. The x²+v² arises because H₂ is the pseudo‐Goldstone of the broken global symmetry in the φ–h directions, and the loop factor 1/(8π²) is the standard one‐loop coefficient.; answer: The one-loop mass correction for H₂ takes the form:\n\nm_{H₂}² ≃ 1/[8π²·(x² + v²)] · {  + α₁·M_{h₁}⁴  + α₂·M_W⁴  + α₃·M_Z⁴  + α₅·M_{H±}⁴  + α₆·M_{H⁰}⁴  + α₇·M_{A⁰}⁴  – α₄·M_t⁴  – α₈·∑_i M_{N_i}⁴ }\n\nKey features:\n • Prefactor 1/(8π²(x²+v²)): loop suppression and normalization by the total VEV squared.\n • Quartic mass dependence M⁴: each particle’s contribution scales as its mass to the fourth power.\n • Positive contributions from bosonic loops (scalars and gauge bosons).\n • Negative contributions from fermionic loops (top quark and singlet fermions).\nDebate agent uMW0, round 0, debating candidate formulas, thinking: Comparing against the derived structure: the one-loop mass correction for the pseudo-Goldstone boson must scale as 1/[8π²(x²+v²)] times the sum of quartic mass terms, with positive signs for all bosonic contributions (h₁, W, Z, H±, H⁰, A⁰) and negative signs for fermionic loops (top quark and singlet neutrinos).
