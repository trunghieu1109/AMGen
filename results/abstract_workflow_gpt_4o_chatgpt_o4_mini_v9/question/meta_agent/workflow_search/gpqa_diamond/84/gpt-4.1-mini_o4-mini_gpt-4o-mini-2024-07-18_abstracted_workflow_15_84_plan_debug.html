    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 1.05&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.98&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.53&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.30&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Compare the computed temperature ratio from Sub-task 3 with the provided multiple-choice options (~1.05, ~0.98, ~0.53, ~1.30) and identify the closest match as the final answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Uy3J:
The equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the semi-major axes via T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Without numeric values for the orbital distances (or periods) a1 and a2, we cannot compute a numerical ratio to compare with the provided options.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3D7q:
We can infer the ratio of orbital distances from the RV shifts: v1/v2 = δλ1/δλ2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75. For circular orbits, Teq∝a^(–1/2), so T1/T2 = √(a2/a1) = v1/v2 = 0.75. Among the choices (~1.05, ~0.98, ~0.53, ~1.30), ~0.53 is the closest to 0.75.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mowW:
We use the equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). We infer the orbital distances a via the stellar reflex velocity K ≈ M_p√(G/(aM_star)), so a ∝ M_p^2/K^2. Thus a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2*(K1/K2)^2. With M1=7 M⊕, M2=5 M⊕, K1/K2 = (Δλ1/λ)/(Δλ2/λ) = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, so a2/a1 = (5/7)^2*(0.75)^2 ≈ (0.714)^2*(0.75)^2 ≈ 0.510. Then T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.510) ≈ 0.714, but using more precise Δλ-based velocities (1.29 km/s and 1.90 km/s) gives ≈0.48–0.53. The closest choice is ~0.53.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent cMtE:
We can infer the semi-major axis ratio from the RV amplitudes: K∝Mp/√a. Given K1/K2=0.03/0.04=0.75 and M1/M2=7/5=1.4, we get √(a2/a1)=0.75/1.4≈0.5357. Since Teq∝1/√a, T1/T2=√(a2/a1)≈0.5357, which matches ~0.53.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Uy3J:
T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the orbital distances (a1 and a2) or orbital periods for Planet1 and Planet2 to determine their semi-major axes and compute the numeric temperature ratio.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the closest temperature ratio choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
