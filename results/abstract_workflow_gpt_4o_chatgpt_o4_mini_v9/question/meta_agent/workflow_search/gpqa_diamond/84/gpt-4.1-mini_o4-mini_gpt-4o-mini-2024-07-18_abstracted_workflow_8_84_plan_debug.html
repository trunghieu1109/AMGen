    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 1.05&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.98&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.53&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.30&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 based on Sub-task 3 results, and compare this ratio to the provided multiple-choice options to identify the closest match. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ucuh:
We can estimate the orbital distances from the measured RV amplitudes using K ∝ M_p/√a (for the same star and inclination), so a ∝ (M_p/K)^2.  With M1=7 M⊕, K1=(0.03/6300)c≈1.43 km/s and M2=5 M⊕, K2=(0.04/6300)c≈1.90 km/s, we find a1/a2≈(7/1.43)²/(5/1.90)²≈3.49.  The equilibrium temperature scales as T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/², so T1/T2=√(a2/a1)≈1/√3.49≈0.535, which is closest to ~0.53.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 9DZ0:
We need the semi-major axes (a₁, a₂) to compute the numerical ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 = √(a₂/a₁). Without those values, we can only express the ratio symbolically and cannot match it to the given choices.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ucuh:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 9DZ0:
T_eq1/T_eq2 = √(a₂/a₁)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the orbital semi-major axes (a₁ and a₂) or periods so we can compute the numerical ratio and select the closest choice.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the ratio of equilibrium temperatures and closest multiple-choice option.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
