Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_84
proposed answer: Using the RV amplitudes K∝Mp/√a, we have a∝(Mp/K)². With M1=7M⊕, K1≈(0.03/6300)c≈1.43 km/s and M2=5M⊕, K2≈1.90 km/s, we find a1/a2≈(7/1.43)²/(5/1.90)²≈3.49. The equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2∝√(a2/a1)≈1/√3.49≈0.535, which matches choice ~0.53.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_84
proposed answer: We infer the semi-major axis ratio using RV amplitude ratios and planet masses: K∝Mp/√a gives √(a2/a1)=K1/K2×M2/M1≈0.75×(5/7)≈0.536. Since Teq∝1/√a, T1/T2≈0.536, matching option ~0.53.
