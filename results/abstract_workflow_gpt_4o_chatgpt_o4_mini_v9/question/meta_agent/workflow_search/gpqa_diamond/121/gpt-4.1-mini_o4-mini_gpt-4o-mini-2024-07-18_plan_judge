Question: Example(question='acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)', choice1='12', choice2='10', choice3='5', choice4='8', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_121
proposed answer: The molecule is symmetric with two identical diethyl cyanoacetate ends connected by a pentamethylene linker. The unique proton environments are: ethyl CH3, ethyl OCH2, CH(CN) methine, CH2 α to the cyano-substituted carbon, CH2 β to the cyano-substituted carbon, and the central CH2. Thus there are 6 distinct 1H NMR signals.

proposed answer: Product 4 is a symmetric diester with two identical termini and a pentamethylene linker. The proton environments are: (1) ethyl CH₃, (2) ethyl OCH₂, (3) CH adjacent to CN and CO₂, (4) linker CH₂ α to the CH(CN) centers, (5) linker CH₂ β to those centers, and (6) the central linker CH₂. Thus there are 6 chemically distinct ¹H signals.
