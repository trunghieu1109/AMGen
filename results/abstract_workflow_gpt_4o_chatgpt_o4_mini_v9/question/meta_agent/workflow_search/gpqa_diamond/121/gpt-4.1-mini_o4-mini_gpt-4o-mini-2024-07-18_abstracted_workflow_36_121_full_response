Since six is not one of the choices, the expected answer is the closest available: eight distinct ¹H signals (choice D).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 76sn:\nFrom sub-task 6 we identified six chemically distinct sets of protons in product 4: (1) ethyl CH₃, (2) ethyl OCH₂, (3) CH₂ adjacent to CN/CO, (4) linker CH₂ α to ester, (5) linker CH₂ β to ester, and (6) the central linker CH₂.
