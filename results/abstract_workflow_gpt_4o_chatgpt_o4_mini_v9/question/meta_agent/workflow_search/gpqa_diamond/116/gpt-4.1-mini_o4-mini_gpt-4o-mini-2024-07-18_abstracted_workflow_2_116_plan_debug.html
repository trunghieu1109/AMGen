    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the evaluation results from Sub-task 3, compare which compounds exhibit optical isomerism and select the correct choice from the provided options: 1) 2 and 3, 2) 1 and 2, 3) 3 and 4, 4) 1, 2 and 4. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 26Fq:
Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism according to Sub-task 3, yet none of the provided options list only 2. Therefore no choice matches the correct result.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent BgCr:
Sub-task 3 established that only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 lack stereogenic elements. However, none of the provided choices corresponds to “only 2,” making the options inconsistent with the analysis.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 26Fq:
None of the provided choices. Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.
[TOO_HARD]
Please revise the answer choices to include an option for only compound 2, as currently no choice matches this result.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent BgCr:
None of the given options.
[TOO_HARD]
Please verify whether any additional stereochemical features were overlooked for compounds 3 or 4, or revise the answer choices to include the case of only compound 2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on which choice correctly lists all compounds exhibiting optical isomerism.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
