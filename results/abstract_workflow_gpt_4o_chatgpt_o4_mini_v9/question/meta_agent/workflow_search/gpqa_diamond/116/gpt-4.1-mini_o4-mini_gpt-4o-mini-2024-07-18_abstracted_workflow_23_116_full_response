This is a conceptual explanation and does not require missing information or further decomposition, so no [TOO_HARD] mark is needed.; answer: Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism in which two (or more) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers. Necessary structural features:\n• Chiral center: typically a tetrahedral (sp3) atom—most often carbon—that carries four different substituents. This asymmetry means the molecule and its mirror image cannot be overlaid.\n• Absence of an internal mirror plane or center of symmetry in the molecule’s three-dimensional structure.\nOptical activity:\n• Enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in equal but opposite directions. One isomer is dextrorotatory (rotates light to the right, labeled “+”), and its mirror image is levorotatory (rotates light to the left, labeled “–”).\n• A racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers) is optically inactive because the rotations cancel.\nIn summary, molecules must have at least one chiral center (or another element of asymmetry) and lack symmetry so that they exist as two non-superimposable mirror images that differ in their effect on plane-polarized light.\nCoT agent JRCl, identifying molecular structures, thinking: The question asks for structural identification of known compounds; sufficient information is provided.
