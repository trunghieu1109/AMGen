Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_116
proposed answer: Only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a stereogenic center and can exhibit optical isomerism; compounds 1, 3, and 4 lack chiral centers. None of the given options corresponds to “only 2.”

Answer:None of the provided choices
[TOO_HARD]
Please revise the answer choices to include an option for only compound 2, as currently no choice matches this result.
Extracted answer: None of the provided choices
Correct answer: 1
