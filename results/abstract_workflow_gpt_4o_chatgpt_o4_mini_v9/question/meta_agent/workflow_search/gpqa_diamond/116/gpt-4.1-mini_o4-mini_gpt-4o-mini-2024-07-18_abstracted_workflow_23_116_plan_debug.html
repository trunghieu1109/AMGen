    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Match the identified moieties that show optical isomerism (from Sub-task 5) with the provided answer choices (choice1 to choice4) to select the correct option(s). 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent HtDw:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, which corresponds to choice2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 4kOv:
Compounds 1 and 2 were identified as showing optical isomerism. Among the provided options, choice2 corresponds to 1 and 2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 6hbj:
From Sub-task 5, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. Among the given choices, choice2 (‘1 and 2’) corresponds to compounds 1 and 2. Hence the correct option is B).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent H69T:
Based on Sub-task 5, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. Matching this to the provided choices, choice2 corresponds to “1 and 2.”

### answer #1 by Debate Agent HtDw:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 4kOv:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 6hbj:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent H69T:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the correct answer choice(s).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
