This is straightforward and can be answered fully without marking as [TOO_HARD].; answer: Optical isomerism arises when a molecule is chiral—i.e. it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image—and therefore rotates plane-polarized light. Key structural features and criteria: 1. Presence of one or more stereogenic (chiral) centers: a carbon (or other atom) bonded to four different substituents. 2. No internal mirror plane or inversion center: the molecule must lack symmetry that makes the mirror image identical. 3. If one stereocenter exists, two enantiomers are possible; with n stereocenters (and no meso form), up to 2^n stereoisomers exist. 4. Molecules with chiral axes or planes (e.g., certain biphenyls with restricted rotation) can also be optically active. 5. Functional groups per se (like carbonyls or double bonds) confer no optical activity unless they create a chiral environment. In practice, to identify optical isomerism, look for atoms with four distinct substituents or for rigid, nonsymmetrical axes of chirality, and verify the absence of an internal symmetry element.\nCoT-SC agent zkEI, extracting molecular structures and stereochemical features, thinking: To prepare for evaluating optical isomerism, we need to extract each compound’s 2D connectivity and identify any stereogenic elements (chiral centers or rigid chiral axes). All needed structural details are in the names, so no additional information is required.; answer: Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6\\'-dinitro-[1,1\\'-biphenyl]-2,2\\'-dicarboxylate\n• Structure: two phenyl rings linked at the 1,1\\' positions; each ring bears a CO2Me at C2/C2\\' and a NO2 at C6/C6\\'.\n• Key stereochemical feature: ortho substituents cause restricted rotation (potential atropisomerism), but identical substitution on both rings yields an internal mirror plane—molecule is overall achiral.\n\nCompound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n• Structure: CH3–CH(OH)–CO2Me\n• Key stereochemical feature: C2 is bonded to OH, H, CH3, and CO2Me (four different groups) — one stereogenic (chiral) center.\n\nCompound 3: benzophenone\n• Structure: Ph–CO–Ph\n• Key stereochemical feature: no atom bears four different substituents; rotation about the Ar–C(=O) bond is free—achiral.\n\nCompound 4: dimethyl fumarate\n• Structure: MeO2C–CH=CH–CO2Me, trans (E) alkene\n• Key stereochemical feature: although the C=C has E configuration, each vinylic carbon bears identical pairs of substituents across the double bond, and a mirror plane through the alkene makes the molecule achiral.\nCoT-SC agent oNG7, extracting molecular structures and stereochemical features, thinking: We need to extract for each compound its molecular structure and any stereochemical features (chiral centers or axes) relevant to optical activity.; answer: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: biphenyl core with nitro groups at 6,6' and ester groups at 2,2'; restricted rotation about the biaryl bond can create axial chirality if rotation is sterically hindered. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3–CH(OH)–CO2Me; single stereogenic carbon (–CH–) bonded to OH, CH3, H, and CO2Me, giving one chiral center. Benzophenone: Ph2C=O; planar ketone with two identical phenyl substituents, no stereocenters or chiral axes, achiral. Dimethyl fumarate: trans-CO2Me–CH=CH–CO2Me; E-alkene with a plane of symmetry, no stereogenic center or chiral axis, achiral.\nCoT-SC agent x02W, extracting molecular structures and stereochemical features, thinking: We need to list each compound, outline its structural formula in brief, and highlight any stereogenic elements (chiral centers or axes). None require molecular drawings, just the key stereochemical features. All information is available from nomenclature, so it’s doable.; answer: 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n   • Structure: Biphenyl core with methyl ester groups at 2,2'-positions and nitro groups at 6,6'-positions.\n   • Stereochemical feature: Substituents at ortho positions on each ring hinder free rotation about the inter-ring bond, creating an atropisomeric (axially chiral) axis.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n   • Structure: CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3\n   • Stereochemical feature: Carbon-2 is bonded to four different substituents (H, OH, CH3, and COOCH3), making it a single stereogenic center.\n\n3. Benzophenone\n   • Structure: (C6H5)2C=O\n   • Stereochemical feature: The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized (planar) and there are no stereogenic centers or axes—optically inactive.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate\n   • Structure: CH3OOC–CH=CH–COOCH3 (trans configuration)\n   • Stereochemical feature: The double bond is E (trans), but both sp2 carbons and ester substituents lie in a plane; no chiral centers or chiral axes.\nReflexion CoT agent C1Rz, evaluating optical isomerism for compounds, thinking: From the extracted features: only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic center (C bonded to OH, H, CH₃, CO₂Me). The biphenyl derivative has an internal mirror plane, benzophenone has no chiral center, and fumarate is achiral. Thus only compound 2 is optically active.; answer: Compound 1: no optical isomerism\nCompound 2: yes (one chiral center)\nCompound 3: no optical isomerism\nCompound 4: no optical isomerism\n\nOnly methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\nCritic agent SXTM, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) as chiral due to its stereocenter, but it overlooks that the 6,6′-dinitro biphenyl derivative (1) can exhibit axial chirality (atropisomerism) when restricted rotation around the biaryl bond makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) have no stereogenic elements and are achiral. Thus the complete set of optically isomeric moieties is compounds 1 and 2.; answer: 1 and 2\nReflexion CoT agent C1Rz, refining evaluation, thinking: I compared each compound’s stereochemical elements against the criteria for optical activity: chiral centers (four different substituents) or rigid chiral axes without an internal symmetry plane. Compound 2 has one stereogenic center (CH bonded to OH, H, CH₃, CO₂Me) and is thus optically active. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 lack any stereogenic center or unsymmetrical rigid axis (compound 1 is symmetrical about the biphenyl axis and has a mirror plane), so they are achiral.; answer: Compound 1: no optical isomerism\nCompound 2: yes, exhibits optical isomerism\nCompound 3: no optical isomerism\nCompound 4: no optical isomerism\nOnly methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) exhibits optical isomerism.\nDebate agent 26Fq, round 0, debating correct choice, thinking: Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism according to Sub-task 3, yet none of the provided options list only 2.
