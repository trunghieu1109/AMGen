Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_23
proposed answer: Mixture X consists of C6H8 (8 H) and C6H10 (10 H); equimolar gives 8+10=18 total H atoms, corresponding to choice D).
