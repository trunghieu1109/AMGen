No conjugated multiple bonds ⇒ these are isolated (aliphatic) double/triple bonds. Thus X must be a pair of simple aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g. an alkene and an alkyne (or two isolated alkenes).; answer: Mixture X contains non-conjugated aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbons (isolated C=C and/or C≡C bonds), most likely one alkene and one alkyne.\nCoT-SC agent ywsn, analyzing transformation X to Y, thinking: Mixture Y does not decolorize Br₂ (no C=C or C≡C), yet on H₂ Pt it gives only Z (cyclohexane), which is itself one component of Y. The only way both components of Y yield cyclohexane is that one is cyclohexane (already saturated) and the other is benzene (an aromatic that requires harsh H₂/Pt to hydrogenate to cyclohexane). These arise by transfer hydrogenation (disproportionation) of the isolated unsaturates in X: one unsaturated dehydrogenates to benzene, the other hydrogenates to cyclohexane.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, formed by transfer hydrogenation between the two unsaturated components of mixture X (one component dehydrogenates to benzene, the other hydrogenates to cyclohexane).\nCoT-SC agent 7H12, analyzing transformation X to Y, thinking: Mixture X from sub-task 1 contains an isolated diene (1,4-cyclohexadiene) and an alkene (cyclohexene). Under Pt/heat these undergo intramolecular hydrogen transfer (disproportionation): the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene while its H2 reduces the alkene to cyclohexane. Both benzene (an aromatic) and cyclohexane (a cycloalkane) are liquids that do not decolorize Br2 water, and hydrogenation of either yields cyclohexane (Z).; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane formed by Pt-catalyzed disproportionation: C6H8 + C6H10 → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane).\nCoT-SC agent 6ouN, analyzing transformation X to Y, thinking: Mixture X comprises cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), both non-conjugated unsaturated cyclics that decolorize Br2. On Pt and heat they undergo intramolecular H-transfer (disproportionation): C6H8 loses H2 to give benzene (C6H6), while C6H10 gains H2 to give cyclohexane (C6H12). Both products are liquids that do not decolorize bromine water.; answer: Mixture Y contains benzene and cyclohexane, formed by transfer-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (→ benzene) and cyclohexene (→ cyclohexane).\nCoT agent LIcz, determining hydrocarbon Z, thinking: Sub-task 2 gave mixture Y as benzene and cyclohexane. Z is the only product from hydrogenation of Y under severe H2/Pt and is already a constituent of Y. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane, while cyclohexane is saturated and does not react further. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%; for C6H12 this is 12/(6×12+12)=12/84=0.142857=14.28%. Thus Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.; answer: Cyclohexane, C6H12\nReflexion CoT agent Z1Vz, deducing molecular formulas of liquids in mixture X, thinking: Mixture Y is benzene and cyclohexane formed by a transfer hydrogenation between a diene and an alkene. The only non‐conjugated cyclohexadiene is cyclohex-1,4-diene (C6H8), which can lose H2 to give benzene, and cyclohexene (C6H10) can gain H2 to give cyclohexane. Thus X is equimolar cyclohex-1,4-diene and cyclohexene.; answer: C6H8 and C6H10\nCritic agent RRdc, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed formulas C6H8 (non-conjugated cyclohex-1,4-diene) and C6H10 (cyclohexene) satisfy all given constraints and reaction pathways, so the deduction is correct.; answer: C6H8 and C6H10\nReflexion CoT agent Z1Vz, refining molecular formulas, thinking: Mixture X yields benzene and cyclohexane by transfer hydrogenation, and both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z). The only non‐conjugated diene that can dehydrogenate to benzene is cyclohex-1,4-diene (C6H8), and the alkene must be cyclohexene (C6H10) to hydrogenate to cyclohexane.; answer: The molecular formulas of the two liquids in mixture X are C6H8 and C6H10.\nDebate agent FyH3, round 0, calculating total hydrogen atoms, thinking: The equimolar mixture contains one mole each of C6H8 (8 H atoms) and C6H10 (10 H atoms).
