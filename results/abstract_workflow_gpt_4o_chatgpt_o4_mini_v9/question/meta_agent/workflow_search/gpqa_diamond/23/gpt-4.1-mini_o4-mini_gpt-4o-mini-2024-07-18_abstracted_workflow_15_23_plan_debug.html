{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;22&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;12&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;16&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;18&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on molecular formulas of mixture X liquids. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Sc5O:
Disproportionation of equimolar unsaturated C6 compounds to C6H6 and C6H12 under Pt/heat requires one donor losing 2 H (C6H8 → C6H6) and one acceptor gaining 2 H (C6H10 → C6H12). Both decolorize Br2 and lack conjugation. Severe H2/Pt fully hydrogenates both to C6H12. Thus mixture X must be C6H8 (a nonconjugated cyclohexadiene) and C6H10 (cyclohexene).

### answer by Final Decision Agent Sc5O:
The two liquids in mixture X have molecular formulas C6H10 and C6H8.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X by summing the hydrogen atoms from the molecular formulas deduced in Sub-task 5.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
