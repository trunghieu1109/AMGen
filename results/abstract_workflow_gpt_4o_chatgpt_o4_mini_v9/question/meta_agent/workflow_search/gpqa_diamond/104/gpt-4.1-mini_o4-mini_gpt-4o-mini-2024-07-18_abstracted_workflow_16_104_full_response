Calculating gives ≃5830K.; answer: ≈5830K\nCoT-SC agent XGA7, calculating flux ratio, thinking: We apply the Stefan–Boltzmann law: flux F ∝ T^4. Using T_spotted≈5830\u2009K and T_unspotted=6000\u2009K gives F_spotted/F_unspotted = (5830/6000)^4 ≈0.89.; answer: The brightness (flux) ratio between the spotted and unspotted hemispheres is ≈0.89.\nCoT-SC agent 56Mh, calculating flux ratio, thinking: We have T_eff_spotted≈5830K and T_unspotted=6000K. The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives surface flux F∝T^4. Thus the brightness ratio is F_spotted/F_unspotted = (5830/6000)^4 ≃ (0.9717)^4 ≃ 0.89.; answer: F_spotted/F_unspotted ≃ (5830/6000)^4 ≃ 0.89\nCoT-SC agent B5TH, calculating flux ratio, thinking: Applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law, flux F ∝ T^4. We have T_spotted_hemi ≈5830 K and T_unspotted_hemi=6000 K. Thus F_spotted/F_unspotted = (5830/6000)^4. Compute (0.9717)^4 ≃ exp(4·ln(0.9717)) ≃ exp(4·(–0.0288)) ≃ exp(–0.1152) ≃0.89.; answer: F_spotted / F_unspotted ≃ 0.89\nReflexion CoT agent msOD, calculating fractional brightness change, thinking: The flux ratio between the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted one is ≈0.89. When the spotted side faces us the observed flux is 0.89 F0; when the unspotted side faces us it’s 1 F0. The fractional change is (1–0.89)=0.11 or 11%. ; answer: ≈11%\nCritic agent 8lFI, providing feedback, thinking: The 11% estimate (ΔF/F≈1–F_spotted/F_unspotted≈0.11) is a reasonable back‐of‐the‐envelope result under the assumption that both the quiet photosphere and spots emit as perfect blackbodies and that 20% of one hemisphere is uniformly covered by spots 1000\u2009K cooler.  It captures the first‐order flux deficit but ignores several real‐world effects.; answer: Limitations:\n1. Limb darkening: the spotted and unspotted areas near the stellar limb contribute less flux than at disk center, reducing the actual contrast.\n2. Spot contrast vs. wavelength: blackbody assumption overestimates spot dimming in broad photometric bands where molecular absorption and line blanketing alter flux.\n3. Inhomogeneous spot properties: real spots have penumbrae/umbrae with temperature gradients, not a single ΔT.\n4. Faculae and plages: bright active regions often accompany spots and partially offset the flux deficit.\n5. Geometric visibility: as the star rotates, only parts of the spots cross the disk center, so the peak‐to‐peak amplitude is typically lower than the full‐hemisphere estimate.\nReflexion CoT agent msOD, refining fractional brightness change, thinking: We use the flux ratio F_spotted/F_unspotted ≃0.89 from Sub‐task 2. When the spotted hemisphere faces us we see 0.89\u2009F0; when the unspotted hemisphere faces us we see 1\u2009F0. The fractional brightness change is ΔF/F = (1–0.89) ≃0.11 or 11%. This back‐of‐the‐envelope ignores limb darkening, spot distribution, and spectral band effects.; answer: ≈11%\nCoT agent uvyW, translating brightness change to radius ratio, thinking: The fractional brightness change ΔF/F ≃0.11 equals the transit depth (Rpl/Rstar)^2.
