Its effective temperature is (0.2·5000^4 + 0.8·6000^4)^(1/4) ≈ 5840 K, rounded to ~5850 K.; answer: 5850 K\nCoT-SC agent QA9c, calculating relative brightness, thinking: Using Stefan–Boltzmann law, flux ∝ T^4, so the ratio is (5850\u2009K / 6000\u2009K)^4 = 0.975^4 ≈ 0.904.; answer: ≈0.90\nCoT-SC agent LWt6, calculating relative brightness, thinking: Using Stefan–Boltzmann law, flux ∝ T^4.  So the ratio F_spotted/F_unspotted = (T_spotted_eff/T_unspotted)^4 = (5850\u2009K/6000\u2009K)^4 = (0.975)^4 ≈ 0.905, or about 90.5%.; answer: ≈0.905 (≈90.5%)\nCoT-SC agent ptye, calculating relative brightness, thinking: Apply Stefan–Boltzmann law: flux ∝ T^4. Use T_spotted=5850 K, T_unspotted=6000 K. Compute (5850/6000)^4 = (0.975)^4 ≈ 0.90.; answer: The relative brightness is (5850/6000)^4 ≈ 0.90 (90%).\nCoT agent 312T, calculating fractional brightness change, thinking: The spotted hemisphere has flux 0.904 times the unspotted one, so the drop in brightness is 1 - 0.904 = 0.096, i.e. a ~9.6% fractional variation.; answer: ≈0.096 (≈9.6%)\nReflexion CoT agent QN5p, computing radius ratio, thinking: The fractional brightness change from spots is ΔF/F≈0.096. Equating this to a transit depth δ=(Rpl/Rstar)^2 gives Rpl/Rstar≈√0.096≈0.31, matching choice ~0.32.; answer: B)\nCritic agent ZD7P, providing feedback, thinking: The chain‐of‐thought correctly uses the spot‐induced flux drop ΔF/F≈0.10 (from 20% spot coverage on one hemisphere with T_s=5000\u2009K vs T=6000\u2009K) and equates it to the transit depth δ=(R_pl/R_star)^2. Taking R_pl/R_star=√(ΔF/F)≈√0.10≈0.32 is both mathematically and physically sound.; answer: ~0.32\nReflexion CoT agent QN5p, refining radius ratio, thinking: We have a fractional brightness change ΔF/F≈0.096 from spots. Equating this to a transit depth δ=(Rpl/Rstar)^2 gives Rpl/Rstar=√0.096≈0.31, corresponding to choice ~0.32.; answer: B)\nDebate agent FdfH, round 0, comparing radius ratio, thinking: The computed radius ratio is √0.096 ≈ 0.31, which is closest to the provided option ~0.32.; answer: B)\nDebate agent niKb, round 0, comparing radius ratio, thinking: From Sub-task 4 we found Rpl/Rstar ≈ √0.096 ≈ 0.31.
