        "response": "None of the four given sequences installs the cyclohexyl substituent correctly, gives the cis\u2010alkene selectively, performs reductive ozonolysis to dialdehyde, and then selectively reduces only one aldehyde to the secondary alcohol. Each choice fails at one or more critical steps: wrong alkyl halide, inappropriate hydrogenation method, missing or incorrect ozonolysis/reduction steps. Because no option achieves all four transformations in order, no sequence can be selected as correct.\n\nAnswer:None of the provided sequences is correct.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease decompose the target synthesis into the four key transformations (cyclohexyl alkylation of the terminal alkyne, cis\u2010hydrogenation, reductive ozonolysis, selective aldehyde reduction) and propose suitable reagents for each step to arrive at the desired product.",
