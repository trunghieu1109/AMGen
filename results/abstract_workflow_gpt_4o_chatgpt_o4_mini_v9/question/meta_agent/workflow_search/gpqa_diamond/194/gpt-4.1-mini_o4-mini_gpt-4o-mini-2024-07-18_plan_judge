Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_194
proposed answer: The calculated maximum orbital period is ≃33 days, which is closest to the provided choice of ≃33.5 days (choice2).

proposed answer: Based on the previous estimate of P₂,max ≈ 27 days, the closest choice among ~7.5, ~33.5, ~37.5, and ~12.5 days is ~33.5 days. However, the stellar mass assumption (derived from a rough mass–radius relation) introduces significant uncertainty in the period estimate.

Answer:B)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide a more precise stellar mass or a detailed mass–radius relation to refine this period estimate.
