    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 7.5&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 33.5&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 37.5&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 12.5&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated maximum orbital period of the second planet with the provided multiple-choice options (~7.5, ~33.5, ~37.5, ~12.5 days) and select the closest matching value. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Eqo7:
Sub-task 6 gave a maximum orbital period of ≃33 days. Among the options (~7.5, ~33.5, ~37.5, ~12.5), 33 days is closest to ~33.5 days, which is choice2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent OoFP:
The calculated maximum orbital period is ≃33 days, which is closest to the provided choice of ≃33.5 days (choice2).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Eqo7:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent OoFP:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on the closest matching maximum orbital period.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
