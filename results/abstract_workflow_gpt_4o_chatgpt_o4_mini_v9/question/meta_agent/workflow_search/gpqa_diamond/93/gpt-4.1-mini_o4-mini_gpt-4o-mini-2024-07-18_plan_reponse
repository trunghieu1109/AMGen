Only 1-vinylcyclohex-1-ene can be isomerized to a 1,3-cyclohexadiene and only methyl hex-2-ynoate can be converted to an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester to serve as the Diels\u2013Alder partners for assembling the octahydronaphthalene core. The other candidates lack the requisite conjugated fragments or demand more extensive, less precedented sequences.\n\nAnswer:A)",
