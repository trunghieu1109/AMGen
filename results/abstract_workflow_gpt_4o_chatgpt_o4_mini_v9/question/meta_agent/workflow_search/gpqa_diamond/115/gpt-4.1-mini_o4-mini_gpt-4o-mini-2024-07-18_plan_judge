Question: Example(question='Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.', choice1='(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', choice2='(1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', choice3='(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', choice4='(1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_115
proposed answer: The Diels–Alder between the cis‐alkene dienophile and the conjugated diene proceeds via the endo transition state to give the syn adduct with stereochemistry (1S,4R,5S,6S). Among the options, only choice 1 matches the 4,5,6‐trimethylcyclohex‐2‐enol framework with that stereochemistry.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_45_115
proposed answer: Comparing the endo‐selective Diels–Alder adduct’s stereochemistry—OH at C1 and methyls at C4, C5, C6 all syn—to the options shows only (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol matches.
