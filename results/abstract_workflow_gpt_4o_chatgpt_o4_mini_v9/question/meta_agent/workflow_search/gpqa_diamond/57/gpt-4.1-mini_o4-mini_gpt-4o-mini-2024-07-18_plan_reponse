Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, has no quantum UV divergences but is not a quantum framework. Superstring Theory, thanks to its extended one-dimensional objects and intrinsic string length scale, is manifestly UV finite and never needs an ad hoc high-energy regulator.\n\nAnswer:A)",
