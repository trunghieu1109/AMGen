At an observation point with position vector r (relative to the same origin), we measure the electromagnetic fields at time t. The fields actually originate from the charge at an earlier retarded time tr defined implicitly by |r – s(tr)| = c (t – tr). We denote d = r – s(tr), the vector from the charge’s retarded position s(tr) to the observation point r. The charge’s velocity at the retarded time is v = ds/dt evaluated at t = tr. The constants are c, the speed of light in vacuum; ε0, the vacuum permittivity; and μ0, the vacuum permeability. These notations set the stage for deriving the retarded scalar potential V(r, t) and vector potential A(r, t) in terms of q, d, v, c, ε0, and μ0.\nCoT-SC agent EGIz, recalling general expressions, thinking: The question asks for the retarded scalar and vector potentials (Liénard–Wiechert potentials) of a point charge in arbitrary motion, expressed in terms of the retarded vector d=r−s(tr), the charge’s velocity v at the retarded time, and constants c, ε0, μ0. These are standard results in electrodynamics.; answer: V(r,t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\bigl(|d| - \\frac{d\\cdot v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Big|_{\\text{ret}} ,\n\nA(r,t) = \\frac{\\mu_0\\,q\\,v}{4\\pi\\bigl(|d| - \\frac{d\\cdot v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Big|_{\\text{ret}}\nCoT-SC agent mrVe, recalling general expressions, thinking: Recall that the Liénard–Wiechert potentials for a point charge moving along s(t) and observed at r and t use the retarded time tr defined by |r–s(tr)|=c(t–tr). The scalar potential is V(r,t)=q/[4πε₀(R–R·v/c)] and the vector potential A(r,t)=μ₀qv/[4π(R–R·v/c)], all quantities evaluated at tr. Here R=d=r–s(tr), v=ds/dt|_{tr}, c is light speed, ε₀ and μ₀ the vacuum constants.; answer: V(r,t)=\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\bigl(d-\\frac{\\mathbf d\\cdot\\mathbf v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Big|_{t_r},\nA(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0\\,q\\,\\mathbf v}{4\\pi\\bigl(d-\\frac{\\mathbf d\\cdot\\mathbf v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Big|_{t_r}\nCoT-SC agent yb6d, recalling general expressions, thinking: The user asks for the general Liénard–Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge, incorporating the retarded time, in terms of their notation (q, d, v, c, ε0, μ0). I recall the standard forms and express them both in vector form (using |d| and direction n) and in the d·v notation.; answer: The Liénard–Wiechert potentials for a point charge q moving along s(t) are evaluated at the retarded time tr defined by |d|=c(t−tr), with d=r−s(tr) and β=v/c.  Let n=d/|d|.  Then:\n\nV(r,t)= q/(4π ε0 |d| (1−n·β))  =  q\u2009c/(4π ε0 (|d|\u2009c − d·v))\n\nA(r,t)= μ0 q\u2009v/(4π |d| (1−n·β))  =  μ0\u2009q\u2009c\u2009v/(4π (|d|\u2009c − d·v))\nCoT agent rhgF, expressing scalar potential V explicitly, thinking: The Liénard–Wiechert scalar potential for a point charge in arbitrary motion is given by q divided by 4πε₀ times 1 over (retarded distance minus the projection of velocity along that distance divided by c). Rewriting the denominator as c|d| − d·v and multiplying numerator and denominator by c yields q c/[4πε₀(c|d|−d·v)].; answer: V(r,t) = \\dfrac{q\\,c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\bigl(c\\,|\\vec d| - \\vec d\\cdot\\vec v\\bigr)}\nCoT agent OqQ7, expressing vector potential A explicitly, thinking: The Liénard–Wiechert vector potential for a moving point charge parallels the scalar potential, with an extra factor of μ₀ v.
