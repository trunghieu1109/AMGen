Retarded Time (tr)\n   • Defined by t − tr = |r − s(tr)|/c, enforcing causality: fields at r and t originate from the charge at an earlier time tr.\n\n3. Geometric Quantities\n   • d = r − s(tr) is the vector from the charge’s retarded position to the field point. Its magnitude d = |d| appears in the denominator along with the projection d·v, encoding aberration and time-retardation effects.\n\n4.

They carry information about q’s position s(tr) and velocity v(tr) at the retarded time tr determined by t–tr=|r–s(tr)|/c, and their denominators encode the finite propagation speed c and the projection of v onto the radiation direction.  ε0 and μ0 enter as normalization factors (1/4πε0 for V, μ0/4π for A) ensuring consistency with Maxwell’s equations.; answer: Scalar potential V and vector potential A are the Liénard–Wiechert retarded potentials, given by\n\n V(r,t) = q\u2009c / [4π\u2009ε0\u2009( d\u2009c – d·v ) ]  \n A(r,t) = μ0\u2009q\u2009c\u2009v / [4π\u2009( d\u2009c – d·v ) ]  \n\nwhere d = r – s(tr) is the displacement from the charge’s retarded position, v = ṡ(tr) its retarded velocity, and tr satisfies t – tr = |d|/c.
