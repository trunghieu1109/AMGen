{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin.

The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t &gt; tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$?

### Sub-task 5: Compare the derived expressions for scalar potential V and vector potential A with each provided choice (choice1 to choice4), checking for consistency in form, variables, and denominators. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wy0f:
The derived scalar and vector potentials are the Liénard–Wiechert forms: V(r,t)=qc/[4πε₀(dc−d·v)] and A(r,t)=μ₀qc v/[4π(dc−d·v)]. Comparing choices:
- Choice1 uses 1/r form and A∝v/c²V: incorrect for moving charge.
- Choice2 matches both denominators and numerators exactly.
- Choice3 is static form with v² factor: wrong.
- Choice4 has plus sign in denominator and wrong μ without subscript: incorrect.
Thus only choice2 is consistent.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent xm7x:
The standard Liénard–Wiechert scalar potential is V=q/(4πε0)/[d−(d·v)/c], which can be written as qc/[4πε0(dc−d·v)], and the vector potential is A=μ0qv/(4πε0)/[d−(d·v)/c]=μ0qc v/[4π(dc−d·v)]. Only choice2 matches both expressions and denominators.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent nEex:
The correct Liénard–Wiechert potentials are
V(r,t)= q c / [4π ε₀ (c|d|−d·v)]
and
A(r,t)= μ₀ q c v / [4π (c|d|−d·v)].
Compare each choice’s form, denominator, and prefactors against these.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wBGj:
The standard Liénard–Wiechert potentials are
V = q /[4π ε₀ (c|d| – d·v)]  and A = μ₀ q c v /[4π (c|d| – d·v)].
Comparing each choice:
• choice1 uses static denominator r and has A ∝ v V/c² – does not match (no retardation factor).
• choice2 exactly matches the LW form, with denominator (c d – d·v) and A = μ₀ q c v /[4π(…)].
• choice3 again uses static r and A ∝ v²V/c² – incorrect.
• choice4 uses (c d + d·v) in denom and wrongly uses μ instead of μ₀ – sign and form wrong.

B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent xm7x:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent nEex:
choice1: Inconsistent. Uses V=q/(4πε₀r) (no retardation), denominator r instead of (c|d|−d·v), and A=vV/c² instead of μ₀qcv/[4π(c|d|−d·v)].
choice2: Consistent. Both V and A match the correct denominators (c|d|−d·v) and numerators qc and μ₀qcv, respectively.
choice3: Inconsistent. Uses wrong A numerator v²V/c² and static denominator r.
choice4: Inconsistent. Denominator uses (c|d|+d·v) with wrong sign, and A’s μ prefactor is incorrect (should be μ₀).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent wBGj:
