proposed answer: The Liénard–Wiechert potentials chosen match standard electromagnetic theory: they include the factors c, ε₀, μ₀ related by μ₀ε₀c²=1, ensure correct SI units (V in volts for V and V·s/m for A), enforce retarded causality via the denominator (d c–d·v) so that t>tr, reduce to the static Coulomb potential as v→0, and satisfy the Lorenz gauge condition ∇·A+μ₀ε₀∂V/∂t=0, guaranteeing consistency with Maxwell’s equations.

Answer:The scalar and vector potentials
V(r,t)=qc / [4π ε₀ (d c – d·v)]
A(r,t)=μ₀ q c v / [4π (d c – d·v)]
satisfy causality (t>tr), have correct units, reduce to the Coulomb form for v→0, and obey Maxwell’s equations in the Lorenz gauge.

proposed answer: The derived Liénard–Wiechert potentials are V(r,t)=qc/[4πε₀(dc−d·v)] and A(r,t)=μ₀qc v/[4π(dc−d·v)]. Only choice2 matches these forms exactly.
