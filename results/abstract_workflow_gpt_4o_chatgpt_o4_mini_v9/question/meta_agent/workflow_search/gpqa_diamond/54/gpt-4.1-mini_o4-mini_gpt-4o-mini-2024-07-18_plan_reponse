The dq at 5.5 ppm shows coupling of ~16 Hz to the other vinyl proton and ~6 Hz to the methyl, consistent with propenyl acetate. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is the acetate methyl and the doublet at 1.6 ppm is the vinyl methyl. No CH2 signals appear, ruling out butenyl acetate. Thus the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nAnswer:A)",
