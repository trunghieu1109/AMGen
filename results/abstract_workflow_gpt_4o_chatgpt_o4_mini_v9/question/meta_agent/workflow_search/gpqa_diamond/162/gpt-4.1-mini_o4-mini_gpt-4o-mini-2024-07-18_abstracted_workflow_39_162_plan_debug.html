{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3&#39;}.
