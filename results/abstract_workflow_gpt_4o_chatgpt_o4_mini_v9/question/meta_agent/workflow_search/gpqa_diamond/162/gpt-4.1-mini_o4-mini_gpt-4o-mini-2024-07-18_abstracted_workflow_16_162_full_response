Then moles = mass/molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol.; answer: 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol\nCoT agent p1as, converting volume to liters, thinking: Converting cubic centimeters to liters: 1 cm3 = 1 mL and 1000 mL = 1 L, so 100 cm3 = 100 mL = 0.100 L.; answer: 0.100 L\nCoT agent 7TNs, identifying reaction and stoichiometry, thinking: Fe(OH)₃ dissolves by protonation of its hydroxide groups. Each hydroxide requires one H⁺ to form water, and there are three hydroxides per formula unit, so 3 H⁺ are needed per Fe(OH)₃.; answer: Fe(OH)₃ + 3 H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3 H₂O; stoichiometry: 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃\nCoT agent 8qM6, calculating minimum acid volume, thinking: Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 9.36×10⁻⁴; H⁺ needed = 3×9.36×10⁻⁴ = 2.808×10⁻³ mol; volume = moles/C = 2.808×10⁻³ mol / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.; answer: 28.08 cm3\nCoT agent Twwf, calculating excess H+ concentration, thinking: Moles H+ added = 0.1 M×0.02808 L = 2.808×10⁻³ mol. Moles H+ consumed by dissolving 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ = 3×(0.1/106.85) = 2.808×10⁻³ mol. Excess H+ = 2.808×10⁻³−2.808×10⁻³ = 0. Total volume = 0.100 L, so [H+]excess = 0/0.100 = 0 M.; answer: 0 M\nCoT agent CHaT, calculating pH, thinking: The calculated excess [H+] is zero, so pH = -log(0) is undefined. In reality water autoprotolysis and Fe³⁺ hydrolysis will produce H⁺, so the pH cannot be determined without those equilibrium data. Therefore the problem as stated is underdetermined.; answer: pH cannot be determined from [H⁺] = 0 alone.
