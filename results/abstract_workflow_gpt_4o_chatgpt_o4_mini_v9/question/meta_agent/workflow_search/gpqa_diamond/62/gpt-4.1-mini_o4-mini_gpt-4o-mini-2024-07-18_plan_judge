proposed answer: The computed photon momentum p ≈ 3.1×10⁻³¹ N·s is orders of magnitude smaller than all provided options (which range from 10⁻²⁸ to 10⁻²⁷ N·s), so none of the choices match.

Answer:None of the provided choices.
[TOO_HARD]
Please re-evaluate the photon energy calculation from sub-task 8, as the computed photon momentum does not match any given option.
Extracted answer: None of the provided choices.
Correct answer: 3
