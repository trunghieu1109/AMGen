    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of Sub-task 4, select the correct statement(s) regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent AQsz:
Based on sub-task 4 results, only statements 2 and 4 are true regarding dual-catalyst ethylene polymerization for regular branching: Al-activators poison the branching catalyst (true), and noble-metal catalysts work but are cost-prohibitive (true).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3mAo:
Sub-task 4 determined that statements 2 and 4 are true while 1 and 3 are false.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent AQsz:
Statements 2 and 4 are correct.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 3mAo:
Statements 2 and 4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct statement(s) regarding the polymer formation with regular branches.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
