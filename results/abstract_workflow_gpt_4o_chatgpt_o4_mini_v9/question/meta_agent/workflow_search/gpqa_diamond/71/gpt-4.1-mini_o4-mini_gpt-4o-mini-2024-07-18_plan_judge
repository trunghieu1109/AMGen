Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_71
proposed answer: Based on the classification from sub-task 9, product 4 has 10 chemically distinct hydrogen environments. Comparing this count with the provided options (7, 8, 10, 4), the correct choice is C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_71
proposed answer: Final product 4 is 1-formylnaphthalene, which has 8 aromatic Hâ€™s plus 1 formyl H. Symmetry equates H2/8, H3/7, H4/6, leaving H5 unique, plus the aldehyde proton: total of 5 chemically distinct H environments.

Answer:5
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide an explicit atom-numbering scheme for intermediate 3 to confirm the regiochemistry of the aromatic collapse.
