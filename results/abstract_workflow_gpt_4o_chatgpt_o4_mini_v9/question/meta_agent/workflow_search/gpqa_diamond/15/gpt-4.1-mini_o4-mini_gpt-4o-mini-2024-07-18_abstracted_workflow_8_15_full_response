Limitations of this analysis include:\n1. Focusing solely on sp³ stereocenters and ignoring potential axial, planar, or helical chirality.\n2. Neglecting conformational flexibility that could introduce internal mirror planes or dynamic meso behavior.\n3. Overlooking cryptochirality in molecules lacking obvious stereogenic centers.\n4. Assuming static configurations without considering racemization or interconversion under experimental conditions.\n5.
