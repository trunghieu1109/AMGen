A couple of notes:\n- For (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the two ring paths differ due to the double bond, so the stereocenter is indeed chiral (no rapid racemizing inversion).  \n- The bicyclic anhydride is rigid with no internal mirror plane, so its two stereocenters yield optical activity as stated.  \nOverall, the analysis is sound given standard conformational rigidity and absence of racemization pathways.; answer: 1) Achiral; 2) Optically active; 3) Achiral (meso); 4) Optically active; 5) Optically active; 6) Achiral; 7) Achiral\nReflexion CoT agent jowT, refining evaluation, thinking: Each compound’s stereogenic elements and symmetry were reassessed: 1) lacks any stereocenter or dissymmetric element; 2) rigid bicyclic framework with two configured centers has no internal mirror plane; 3) R/S on a symmetric backbone yields a meso form; 4) identical R configurations produce a chiral diastereomer; 5) single R center adjacent to unsaturation gives no symmetry; 6) all-cis triol has an S₆ axis (D₃d), rendering it achiral; 7) no sp³ carbon with four different substituents.
