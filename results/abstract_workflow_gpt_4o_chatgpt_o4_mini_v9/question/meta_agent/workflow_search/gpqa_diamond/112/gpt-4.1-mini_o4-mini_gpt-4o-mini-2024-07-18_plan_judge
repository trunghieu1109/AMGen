Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_112
proposed answer: Based on the fragment at m/z 45 indicating a carboxylic acid, the IR showing broad OH, C=O (1700 cm⁻¹) and C=C (1650 cm⁻¹), and NMR vinyl protons, C6H10O2 (one C=O, one C=C, OH) is the only formula matching all data.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_112
proposed answer: FTIR shows a broad O–H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹, a strong C=O absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR reveals vinyl hydrogens and an acidic OH signal. The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Among the candidates, only C6H10O2 accommodates one degree of unsaturation for the C=C, one for the C=O, and the required oxygen content for a carboxylic acid.
