    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C6H10O2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C6H12O&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;C6H10O&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C6H12O2&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Based on the integration of spectral data (Sub-task 4), evaluate and prioritize the candidate chemical formulas (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2) for consistency with all spectral data and select the most likely chemical formula of the unknown compound. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Hbqb:
FTIR shows broad O–H stretch, strong C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹ and C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid; 1H NMR reveals vinyl hydrogens and carboxylic OH; MS fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Only C6H10O2 fits these features.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Tw4h:
The FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid (broad O–H, 1700 cm⁻¹ C=O, 1650 cm⁻¹ C=C), the ¹H NMR shows vinyl protons and an acidic OH, and the m/z 45 fragment (COOH⁺) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Among the formulas, only C6H10O2 supports an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the correct degree of unsaturation.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the most likely chemical formula.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>FTIR shows a broad O–H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹, a strong C=O absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR reveals vinyl hydrogens and an acidic OH signal. The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Among the candidates, only C6H10O2 accommodates one degree of unsaturation for the C=C, one for the C=O, and the required oxygen content for a carboxylic acid.

Answer:C6H10O2</pre>
