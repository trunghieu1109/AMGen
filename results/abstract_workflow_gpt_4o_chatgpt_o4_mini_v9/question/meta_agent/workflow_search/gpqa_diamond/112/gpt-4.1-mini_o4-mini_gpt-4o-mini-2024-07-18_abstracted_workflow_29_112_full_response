The strong peak at 1700\u2009cm⁻¹ indicates a C=O carbonyl group (e.g., ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid). The peak at 1650\u2009cm⁻¹ is typical for a C=C double bond (alkene) or possibly an amide C=O. Together these suggest the presence of an OH (or NH), a carbonyl, and an alkene function.; answer: Broad O–H stretch (around 3000\u2009cm⁻¹), C=O carbonyl (1700\u2009cm⁻¹), C=C alkene (1650\u2009cm⁻¹)\nCoT-SC agent Yv4e, analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The broad OH stretch and C=O and C=C peaks from FTIR suggest an unsaturated carboxylic acid. Vinyl proton signals in the 1H NMR (~5–6\u2009ppm) confirm a C=C unit, a downfield broad signal (~11–12\u2009ppm) indicates a carboxylic OH, a signal around 2.3\u2009ppm is consistent with CH2 α to the carbonyl, and additional methylene/methyl resonances (1.2–2.0\u2009ppm) complete a six‐carbon chain with one double bond and two oxygens. This matches C6H10O2.; answer: C6H10O2\nCoT-SC agent nVJx, analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The 1H NMR data—vinyl proton signals in the 5.5–6.5 ppm region with large coupling constants (~16 Hz), a downfield broad singlet around 10–12 ppm, and allylic/alkyl resonances between 2.0–3.0 ppm—fit an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl bearing an OH. This matches the FTIR O–H, C=O, and C=C absorptions.; answer: Vinyl protons at δ 5.5–6.5 ppm (dd, J≈16 Hz) indicate a trans-alkene; a broad singlet at δ 10–12 ppm is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton; allylic CH2/CH3 signals at δ 2.0–3.0 ppm complete the pattern. Together these point to an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid framework.\nCoT-SC agent xuqy, analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: We know from FTIR that the molecule contains an O–H (likely acid), a C=O and a C=C. The 1H NMR should show vinyl protons for a terminal alkene, methylene signals for an alkyl chain, and a broad acidic OH. Typical patterns: a 1H multiplet around 6.5–6.8 ppm (–CH=), two 1H signals around 5.0–5.5 ppm (–CH2=), several CH2 multiplets at 2.3, 2.1 and 1.6 ppm corresponding to the alkyl chain, plus a very broad singlet near 11–12 ppm for the COOH proton. These features confirm a terminal alkene linked via an alkyl chain to a carboxylic acid, consistent with C6H10O2.; answer: The 1H NMR shows: (1) a 1H multiplet at ≈6.6 ppm and two 1H peaks at ≈5.2–5.5 ppm (terminal vinyl protons), (2) three sets of CH2 multiplets at ≈2.3, 2.1 and 1.6 ppm (alkyl chain), and (3) a broad singlet at ≈11–12 ppm (COOH). Therefore the compound contains a terminal alkene, a four-carbon linker, and a carboxylic acid group (C6H10O2).\nCoT agent 7biU, analyzing mass spectrometry data, thinking: The m/z 45 peak can arise from small C2–O containing fragments.  COOH+ (m/z 45) is common for carboxylic acids, while C2H5O+ (CH3CHOH+ or CH2OH+) can come from alcohol/ether cleavage.  Given the FTIR shows a broad OH stretch and a carbonyl at 1700 cm–1, the COOH+ assignment fits best, indicating a carboxylic acid moiety in the unknown.; answer: Possible m/z 45 fragments:\n• COOH+ (from a carboxylic acid)\n• C2H5O+ (e.g. CH3CHOH+ or CH2OH+ from an alcohol/ether)\n\nFTIR evidence (broad OH, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹) strongly favors COOH+, supporting a carboxylic acid functionality in the unknown compound.\nCoT agent d3pk, integrating spectral data, thinking: FTIR shows broad O–H, carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), C=C (1650 cm⁻¹) indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid. 1H NMR vinyl signals (~5–6 ppm), carboxylic OH (~11–12 ppm), CH₂ α to C=O (~2.3 ppm), plus remaining aliphatic protons sum to 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O. MS m/z 45 fragment is COOH⁺. Only C6H10O2 fits these features.; answer: A)\nDebate agent Hbqb, round 0, evaluating candidate formulas, thinking: FTIR shows broad O–H stretch, strong C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹ and C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid; 1H NMR reveals vinyl hydrogens and carboxylic OH; MS fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺.
