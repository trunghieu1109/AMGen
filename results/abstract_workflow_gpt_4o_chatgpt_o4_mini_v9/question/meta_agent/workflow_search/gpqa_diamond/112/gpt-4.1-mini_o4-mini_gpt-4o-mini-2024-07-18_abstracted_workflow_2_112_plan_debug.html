    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C6H10O2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C6H12O&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;C6H10O&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C6H12O2&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on validated molecular structures based on mass spectrometry fragment data. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent SIGY:
The m/z 45 fragment corresponds to the COOH+ ion, indicating a carboxylic acid functional group. Of the given formulas, only C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 contain two oxygens; C6H12O2 has only one degree of unsaturation (consistent with a single C=O), which cannot account for the observed vinyl protons in the 1H NMR. C6H10O2 has two degrees of unsaturation (one carboxyl C=O and one C=C), matching the IR (broad OH, C=O at 1700, C=C at 1650) and NMR (vinyl hydrogens) data. Therefore, the validated formula is C6H10O2.

### answer by Final Decision Agent SIGY:
C6H10O2

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the validated molecular structures and their corresponding chemical formulas against the given choices (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2) to identify the most likely chemical formula of the unknown compound.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Based on the fragment at m/z 45 indicating a carboxylic acid, the IR showing broad OH, C=O (1700 cm⁻¹) and C=C (1650 cm⁻¹), and NMR vinyl protons, C6H10O2 (one C=O, one C=C, OH) is the only formula matching all data.
