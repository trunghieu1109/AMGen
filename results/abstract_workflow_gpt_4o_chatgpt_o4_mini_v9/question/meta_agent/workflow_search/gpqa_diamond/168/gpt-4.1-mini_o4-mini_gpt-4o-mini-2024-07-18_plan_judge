Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_168
proposed answer: The variant decay replaces two light particles with one massless particle, so the summed energy of the E particles still has a continuous spectrum up to the same endpoint Q. None of the four options describes a continuous spectrum with an unchanged endpoint, so no choice matches.

Answer:None of the above
[TOO_HARD]
Please include an option for a continuous spectrum with the same endpoint energy Q.
Extracted answer: None of the above
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_50_168
proposed answer: We determined that replacing two neutrinos with one massless particle leaves three light final‚Äêstate particles, so the summed E energy spectrum remains continuous. Energy conservation implies the endpoint remains at Q, unchanged. None of the four provided choices matches a continuous spectrum with unchanged endpoint, so we cannot select any of them directly and must request the missing option.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please provide a choice where the spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint is unchanged, since none of the current options matches this scenario.
