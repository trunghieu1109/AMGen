Albedo for all three planets = 0.3.\nCoT agent 3yZ1, extracting mass ratios, thinking: The problem statement explicitly states the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is approximately 1.35.; answer: Planet1\u2009&\u2009Planet2: ~1.15; Planet2\u2009&\u2009Planet3: ~1.35\nCoT agent QE6c, recalling equilibrium temperature formula, thinking: To relate equilibrium temperature to orbital distance and albedo, we use the balance between absorbed stellar radiation and blackbody emission. For circular orbits and equal albedo, the standard derivation applies directly, yielding a closed‐form expression.; answer: T_eq = [ (1 – A)\u2009L_star / (16\u2009π\u2009σ\u2009d^2 ) ]^(1/4)  ,\nwhich for a given star (fixed L_star) and constant albedo A simplifies to T_eq ∝ d^(–1/2).\nCoT agent AEtP, calculating orbital distance ratios, thinking: The equilibrium temperature scales as T_eq ∝ d^(–1/2), so the orbital distance d ∝ T_eq^(–2). Therefore:\n• a1/a2 = (T2/T1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 ≈ 0.51\n• a2/a3 = (T3/T2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ 0.19; answer: Orbital distance ratios: a1/a2 ≈ 0.51; a2/a3 ≈ 0.19.\nCoT agent gAgc, recalling Kepler's third law, thinking: Kepler’s third law relates the square of the orbital period to the cube of the semimajor axis for bodies orbiting the same mass: P^2=(4π^2/GM)a^3. Simplifying constants gives P∝a^{3/2}.; answer: Kepler’s third law: P^2 = (4π^2/GM)·a^3, so for planets around the same star, P ∝ a^{3/2}.\nCoT agent XPLZ, calculating orbital period ratios, thinking: We have a1/a2 ≈0.51 and a2/a3 ≈0.19. By Kepler’s third law P ∝ a^{3/2}, so\n• P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^{3/2} ≈ 0.51^{1.5} ≈ exp(1.5·ln0.51) ≈ 0.36.\n• P2/P3 = (a2/a3)^{3/2} ≈ 0.19^{1.5} ≈ exp(1.5·ln0.19) ≈ 0.083.; answer: P1/P2 ≈ 0.36; P2/P3 ≈ 0.083\nCoT agent bczM, combining orbital period ratios, thinking: We have P1/P2 ≈ 0.36 and P2/P3 ≈ 0.083. Thus P3/P1 = (P3/P2) × (P2/P1) = (1/0.083) × (1/0.36) ≈ 12.05 × 2.78 ≈ 33.5.; answer: B)\nDebate agent YctK, round 0, comparing orbital period ratio with choices, thinking: We have P1/P2 ≈ 0.36 and P2/P3 ≈ 0.083, thus P3/P1 ≈ (1/0.083)*(1/0.36) ≈ 12.05*2.78 ≈ 33.5, which is closest to ~33.4.; answer: B)\nDebate agent PKXu, round 0, comparing orbital period ratio with choices, thinking: From P1/P2≈0.36 and P2/P3≈0.083, we get P3/P1=(1/0.083)*(1/0.36)≈12.05*2.78≈33.5, which is closest to 33.4.; answer: B)\nDebate agent NH0s, round 0, comparing orbital period ratio with choices, thinking: Calculated P3/P1 ≈33.5, which is closest to ~33.4.; answer: B)\nDebate agent Ho57, round 0, comparing orbital period ratio with choices, thinking: We previously found P3/P1 ≈33.5.
