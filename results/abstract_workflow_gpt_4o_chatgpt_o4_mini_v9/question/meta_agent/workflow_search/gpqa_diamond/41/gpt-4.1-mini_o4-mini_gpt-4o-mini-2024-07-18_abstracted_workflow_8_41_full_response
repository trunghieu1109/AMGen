These are directly stated in the problem description.; answer: Extracted quantities:\n- Temperature ratio T1/T2 ≈ 1.4\n- Temperature ratio T2/T3 ≈ 2.3\n- Mass ratio M1/M2 ≈ 1.15\n- Mass ratio M2/M3 ≈ 1.35\n- Albedo for all three planets = 0.3\nCoT agent yIBM, recalling physical formulas, thinking: We need to list (1) equilibrium temperature formula linking T_eq, albedo A, stellar flux, orbital distance; and (2) Kepler’s third law relating orbital period P to semi-major axis a and stellar mass. These are standard.; answer: Relevant formulas:\n\n1. Equilibrium temperature of a planet (assuming zero greenhouse effect, uniform temperature):\n   T_eq = [ (1 – A)\u2009L_star / (16\u2009π\u2009σ\u2009d^2) ]^(1/4)\n   – A is the albedo (reflectivity).\n   – L_star is the stellar luminosity.\n   – σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.\n   – d is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n   \n   Alternatively, since the incident flux at distance d is S = L_star/(4πd^2), one can write:\n   T_eq = [ S\u2009(1 – A) / (4\u2009σ) ]^(1/4).\n\n2. Kepler’s third law for circular orbits around a star of mass M_star:\n   P^2 = (4\u2009π^2\u2009a^3) / (G\u2009M_star)\n   – P is the orbital period.\n   – a (or d) is the semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n   – G is the gravitational constant.\n   – M_star is the mass of the host star.\n\n   In proportional form (for the same central star):\n   P ∝ a^(3/2).\n\nThese relations allow linking equilibrium temperature ratios to distance ratios (via T ∝ d^(–1/2)) and then to period ratios using Kepler’s law (P ∝ d^(3/2)).\nCoT agent Rqxs, deriving orbital radii ratios, thinking: We use the equilibrium temperature relation T_eq ∝ d^(–1/2) for equal albedo and same star. Hence d ∝ T_eq^(–2). Given T1/T2≈1.4 and T2/T3≈2.3: d2/d1=(T1/T2)^2=(1.4)^2≈1.96; d3/d2=(T2/T3)^2=(2.3)^2≈5.29. Therefore d3/d1=d3/d2·d2/d1≈5.29·1.96≈10.37.; answer: a2/a1 ≈ 1.96; a3/a1 ≈ 10.37\nCoT agent MFdV, calculating orbital period ratio, thinking: We have a3/a1 ≈10.37 from Sub‐task 3. Kepler’s third law gives P∝a3/2 (negligible planet masses vs. the star), so P3/P1≈(10.37)3/2≈33.4.; answer: B)\nDebate agent 5qSn, round 0, comparing orbital period ratio with choices, thinking: The calculated orbital period ratio P3/P1 ≈ 33.4 exactly matches choice2 (~33.4).; answer: B)\nDebate agent KvSU, round 0, comparing orbital period ratio with choices, thinking: Using Kepler’s third law, we found P3/P1 ≈ (a3/a1)^(3/2) ≈ 10.37^(3/2) ≈ 33.4, which directly matches choice B).; answer: B)\nFinal Decision agent, deciding closest orbital period ratio, thinking: The calculated orbital period ratio P3/P1 ≈33.4 directly matches choice2 (~33.4).; answer: B)', iteration_idx=-1)]
