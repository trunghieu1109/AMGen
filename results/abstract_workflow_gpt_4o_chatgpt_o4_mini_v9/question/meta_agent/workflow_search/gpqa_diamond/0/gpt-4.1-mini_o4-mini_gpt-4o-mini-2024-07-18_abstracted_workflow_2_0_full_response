For τ₁ = 10⁻⁹\u2009s, ΔE₁ ≈ (6.6×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV·s)/(2×10⁻⁹\u2009s) ≃ 3.3×10⁻⁷\u2009eV, and for τ₂ = 10⁻⁸\u2009s, ΔE₂ ≃ 3.3×10⁻⁸\u2009eV. A shorter lifetime yields a larger ΔE and hence broader spectral lines; the longer‐lived state has a narrower line. To resolve two levels, their energy separation must exceed these linewidths, so states with longer lifetimes can be distinguished more sharply.\nCoT-SC agent gCuk, identifying lifetime-energy uncertainty relationship, thinking: The energy–time uncertainty principle gives ΔE·Δt ≳ ħ/2, so ΔE ≃ ħ/(2τ). Thus shorter lifetimes yield larger energy uncertainties. This directly answers the relationship asked.; answer: The energy uncertainty ΔE and lifetime τ satisfy ΔE ≃ ħ/(2τ), i.e. the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the state’s lifetime: shorter lifetimes produce larger ΔE.\nCoT-SC agent A3AB, identifying lifetime-energy uncertainty relationship, thinking: The energy–time uncertainty principle states that ΔE·Δt ≳ ħ/2. Here the lifetime τ plays the role of Δt, so the energy uncertainty ΔE is inversely proportional to τ. This directly explains why shorter-lived states have larger linewidths and longer-lived states have narrower ones.; answer: The relationship is ΔE ≃ ħ/(2τ), i.e., the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the state’s lifetime: shorter lifetimes yield larger ΔE (broader spectral lines), and longer lifetimes yield smaller ΔE (narrower lines).\nCoT-SC agent RGi4, identifying lifetime-energy uncertainty relationship, thinking: We apply the time–energy uncertainty principle: ΔE ≳ ħ/(2τ). Thus the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Shorter τ gives larger ΔE (broader lines), longer τ gives smaller ΔE (narrower lines).; answer: The energy-time uncertainty principle gives ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), so the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the state’s lifetime: shorter lifetimes yield larger ΔE, and longer lifetimes yield smaller ΔE.\nCoT agent TwPR, calculating minimum energy uncertainties, thinking: We apply the time–energy uncertainty relation ΔE ≃ ħ/(2τ) using ħ ≈ 6.58×10^–16\u2009eV·s. For τ1 = 10^–9\u2009s: ΔE1 ≃ 6.58×10^–16/(2×10^–9) ≃ 3.29×10^–7\u2009eV. For τ2 = 10^–8\u2009s: ΔE2 ≃ 6.58×10^–16/(2×10^–8) ≃ 3.29×10^–8\u2009eV.; answer: ΔE1 ≃ 3.3×10^–7\u2009eV; ΔE2 ≃ 3.3×10^–8\u2009eV.\nCoT agent 0Ypb, determining minimum energy difference for resolution, thinking: To clearly distinguish the two levels, the energy separation must exceed the combined uncertainties: ΔE_required ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≃ 3.3×10⁻⁷\u2009eV + 3.3×10⁻⁸\u2009eV ≃ 3.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV.; answer: Minimum energy difference required ≃ 3.6×10⁻⁷ eV.\nDebate agent mGv8, round 0, evaluating options, thinking: The required minimum energy difference is ≃3.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV.
