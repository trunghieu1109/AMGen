Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_0
proposed answer: The energy-time uncertainty principle requires ΔE ≳ ħ/Δt. With the shorter lifetime 10⁻⁹ s, ΔE_min ≃6.6×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s / 10⁻⁹ s ≃6.6×10⁻⁷ eV (~3.6×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this and thus can be clearly resolved.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: To clearly resolve two energy levels their separation ΔE should exceed the natural linewidth set by the shorter lifetime τ≈10⁻⁹ s. Using ΔE_min≈ħ/τ≈6.6×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s/10⁻⁹ s≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV. Of the given options only 10⁻⁴ eV≫6.6×10⁻⁷ eV, so only choice D) suffices.
