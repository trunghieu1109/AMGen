The eigenvectors of Ay therefore form an orthonormal basis for the spin space and, since A² commutes with Ay, these are also eigenvectors of A² but not of Az (since [Ay,Az]≠0).

I identify S as the Pauli σy matrix and c as ħ/2. This tells me Ay=ħ/2·σy, a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±ħ/2, representing spin‐½ projection along y. These steps fully address the sub‐task.; answer: Sub‐task 1: The 2×2 matrix S=\n[ 0  −i;\n i   0 ]\nis exactly the Pauli σy matrix. The constant c=h/(4π) equals ħ/2, so Ay=c·S=ħ/2·σy. This is a Hermitian operator whose eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, corresponding to the muon’s spin “up” or “down” along the y‐axis. Its eigenvectors form the orthonormal basis of y‐spin states for a spin-½ particle.\nCoT agent TQOi, formulating eigenvalue equation, thinking: To set up the eigenvalue equation we substitute Ay=c·S with c=h/(4π) and write φ as a two‐component column vector [φ1; φ2], then enforce Ay\u2009φ = a\u2009φ in matrix form.; answer: Ay\u2009φ = a\u2009φ, i.e. (h/(4π)) · [[0, −i], [i, 0]] · [φ1; φ2] = a · [φ1; φ2]\nCoT-SC agent 3CHB, calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thinking: We know Ay = (h/4π)[[0,−i],[i,0]] = (h/4π)σy. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1 with eigenvectors (1/√2)[1;±i]. Scaling by h/4π gives eigenvalues ±h/4π, which are real. Eigenvectors correspondingly remain (1/√2)[1;±i].; answer: Eigenvalues: a = +h/(4π) and a = −h/(4π), both real. Corresponding normalized eigenvectors: for a=+h/(4π), φ+ = (1/√2)[1; i]; for a=−h/(4π), φ− = (1/√2)[1; −i].\nCoT-SC agent MuYw, calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thinking: We have Ay=(h/4π)·[[0,−i],[i,0]]. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrix [[0,−i],[i,0]] are ±1. Hence Ay has eigenvalues a=±(h/4π), which are real. Solving (Ay−aI)φ=0 yields for a=+h/4π the condition φ∝[1;\u2009i] and for a=−h/4π the condition φ∝[1;\u2009−i].; answer: Eigenvalues: a=+h/(4π), a=−h/(4π), both real.

Since A² commutes with every component of A, these spin-y eigenstates are also eigenstates of A² (with s=½), but because [Ay,Az]≠0 they cannot be simultaneous eigenstates of Az. Hence φ± are the natural basis functions of Ay (and of the two-dimensional spin-½ space), but they are each linear combinations of the usual |±z⟩ states.; answer: The eigenvectors φ± of Ay are simultaneous eigenfunctions of A² (with eigenvalue s(s+1)h²/4π² for s=½) but not of Az (since [Ay,Az]≠0). They therefore form the orthonormal basis functions of Ay, related to the usual z-basis by φ±=(|+z⟩±i|−z⟩)/√2.\nDebate agent z3kk, round 0, evaluating statements, thinking: From Sub-task 4: eigenvalues of Ay are real ±h/4π, eigenvectors are simultaneous eigenstates of A² but not Az and form the spin-y basis.
