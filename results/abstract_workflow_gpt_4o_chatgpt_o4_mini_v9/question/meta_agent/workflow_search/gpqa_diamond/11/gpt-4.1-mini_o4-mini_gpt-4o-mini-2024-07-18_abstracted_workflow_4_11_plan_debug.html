Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 9: Compare the calculated kinetic energies of mu(+) and neutrino with the given choices to identify the correct option. Use outputs from Sub-task 7 and 8 and the choices in taskInfo. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent bTb2:
Sub-task 7 yielded KE(μ⁺)=4.1 MeV and Sub-task 8 yielded KE(ν)=29.8 MeV. The only choice matching ~4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV is choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent lzdt:
Given KE of muon ≈4.1 MeV and neutrino ≈29.8 MeV, these values match choice4 (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ydVS:
The calculated KE values are approximately 4.1 MeV for μ⁺ and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino, which correspond to choice 4 (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wZed:
The computed KE of muon ≃4.1 MeV and of neutrino ≃29.8 MeV matches choice4 (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Make final decision on the correct choice of kinetic energies.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
