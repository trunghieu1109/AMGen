Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_91
proposed answer: The calculated enthalpy of formation (from Sub-task 4) is –800 kJ/mol. None of the provided choices (11200 kJ/mol, 1900 kJ/g, 11.44 kJ/g, 67.4 kJ/mol) matches that value or unit: the only molar options are positive and of wrong magnitude or sign. Therefore no given choice correctly corresponds to –800 kJ/mol.

Answer:None of the given choices match the calculated enthalpy of formation of –800 kJ/mol.
[TOO_HARD]
Please supply answer choices that include a negative enthalpy of formation or clarify the expected sign and units.
Extracted answer: None of the given choices match the calculated enthalpy of formation of –800 kJ/mol.
Correct answer: 2

proposed answer: The calculated ΔHf is 1900 kJ/mol, but none of the provided options match this value and unit. Option 2 is 1900 kJ/g, which is dimensionally incorrect relative to the calculation.

Answer:No choice matches 1900 kJ/mol
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify whether the 1900 value should be in kJ/mol or if the answer choices’ units need correction.
Extracted answer: No choice matches 1900 kJ/mol
Correct answer: 2
