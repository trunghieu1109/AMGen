### Sub-task 5: Compare the calculated enthalpy of formation (from Sub-task 4) with the given answer choices (11200 kJ/mol, 1900 kJ/g, 11.44 kJ/g, 67.4 kJ/mol) to identify the correct or closest matching value, considering units and magnitude. Provide reasoning for the choice. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 68Tf:
We calculated an enthalpy of formation of –800 kJ/mol. None of the provided options match this value. Options 2 and 3 are given per gram, so their units are inapplicable. Option 1 (11200 kJ/mol) is positive and orders of magnitude too large. The only remaining molar value is 67.4 kJ/mol, which is positive and far smaller in magnitude than our result, and of the wrong sign. Thus no choice correctly corresponds to –800 kJ/mol.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent RlCE:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is −800 kJ/mol, but none of the provided choices (11200 kJ/mol, 1900 kJ/g, 11.44 kJ/g, 67.4 kJ/mol) matches that value or unit. All given options are positive or in different units, so there is no correct match.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 68Tf:
None of the given choices match the calculated value of –800 kJ/mol. The closest in magnitude is 67.4 kJ/mol, but it has the wrong sign and is much smaller than –800 kJ/mol.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent RlCE:
None of the given choices match the calculated value of −800 kJ/mol.
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify the expected sign or units of the enthalpy of formation or provide a matching negative‐valued choice.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct enthalpy of formation value.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
