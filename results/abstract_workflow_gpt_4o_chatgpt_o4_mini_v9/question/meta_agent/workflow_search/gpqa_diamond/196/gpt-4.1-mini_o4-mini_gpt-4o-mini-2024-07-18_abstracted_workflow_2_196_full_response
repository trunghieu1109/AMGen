The sharp peak at 1720\u2009cm⁻¹ corresponds to a C=O stretch of a carbonyl (acid). The absorptions at 1610 and 1450\u2009cm⁻¹ match aromatic C=C stretches.; answer: Broad absorption at 3400–2500\u2009cm⁻¹: carboxylic O–H stretch; Sharp band at 1720\u2009cm⁻¹: carbonyl (C=O) of acid; Bands at 1610 and 1450\u2009cm⁻¹: aromatic C=C stretches → Functional groups present: carboxylic acid and aromatic ring.\nCoT-SC agent ldrT, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The broad 10.5 ppm signal is a carboxylic OH. The pair of 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) with equal integration and similar J values indicates an AA′BB′ pattern of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The aliphatic multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a benzylic methine (CH) adjacent to the aromatic ring. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) is a methylene (CH₂) next in the chain, coupling to both the benzylic CH and a terminal methyl. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H, J≈6–7 Hz) is a methyl directly on the benzylic CH (sec-butyl CH–CH₃). The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H, J≈7 Hz) is the terminal methyl of the CH₂–CH₃ end. Thus Compound X contains a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl substituent.; answer: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): COOH; 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): para-disubstituted aromatic; 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): benzylic CH of sec-butyl; 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH₂ of sec-butyl; 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH–CH₃ methyl; 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH₂–CH₃ methyl\nCoT-SC agent 4Cae, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The broad singlet at 10.5\u2009ppm integrates to 1\u2009H and is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (–COOH). The two aromatic doublets at 8.0\u2009ppm (2\u2009H) and 7.2\u2009ppm (2\u2009H) with equal integration and similar coupling constants indicate a para‐disubstituted benzene ring. The multiplet at 2.9\u2009ppm (1\u2009H), the multiplet at 1.7\u2009ppm (2\u2009H), the doublet at 1.4\u2009ppm (3\u2009H), and the triplet at 0.9\u2009ppm (3\u2009H) fit the pattern of a sec-butyl group: the 2.9\u2009ppm signal is the methine (CH) adjacent to the ring, 1.7\u2009ppm is the CH2 next to it, 1.4\u2009ppm is the methyl on the methine, and 0.9\u2009ppm is the terminal methyl. Thus the data support a para-sec-butylbenzoic acid framework.; answer: Analysis:\n• 10.5\u2009ppm (bs, 1H): carboxylic acid proton\n• 8.0\u2009ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2\u2009ppm (d, 2H): para-disubstituted aromatic protons\n• 2.9\u2009ppm (m, 1H), 1.7\u2009ppm (m, 2H), 1.4\u2009ppm (d, 3H), 0.9\u2009ppm (t, 3H): sec-butyl group (CH–CH2–CH3)\n\nFragment conclusions:\n– Carboxylic acid (–COOH) attached to benzene\n– Para-substitution pattern on the ring\n– Alkyl substituent is sec-butyl\n\nOverall assignment: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\nCoT-SC agent 60Gm, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) for the COOH proton, two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) indicating an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern consistent with para substitution, and aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which correspond to a sec-butyl group (benzylic CH, CH2, methyl on the CH, terminal methyl). Combining this with the carboxylic acid and aromatic ring from Sub-task 1 gives a para-sec-butylbenzoic acid structure.; answer: The NMR data indicate: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) COOH; 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → para-disubstituted benzene; 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → sec-butyl fragment. Combined with sub-task 1, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\nReflexion CoT agent 1OZK, integrating IR and NMR results, thinking: IR shows carboxylic acid (3400–2500\u2009cm⁻¹, C=O at 1720\u2009cm⁻¹) and aromatic ring (1610, 1450\u2009cm⁻¹). 1H NMR shows COOH proton (10.5\u2009ppm), AA′BB′ aromatic pattern (8.0 and 7.2\u2009ppm, 2H each) indicating para substitution, and aliphatic signals matching a sec-butyl group (benzylic CH at 2.9\u2009ppm, CH₂ at 1.7\u2009ppm, CH–CH₃ at 1.4\u2009ppm and CH₂–CH₃ at 0.9\u2009ppm). Together these data fit a para-sec-butyl benzoic acid.; answer: B)\nCritic agent dGQ0, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid structure is fully consistent with the IR evidence for a carboxylic acid (broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹) and aromatic ring absorptions, the AA′BB′ pattern in the ¹H NMR (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, 2H each) indicative of a para‐disubstituted benzene, and the aliphatic multiplets and doublets/triplet corresponding to a sec-butyl side chain. All observed proton environments and functional groups are accounted for.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent 1OZK, refining proposed structure, thinking: The IR spectrum shows a carboxylic acid (broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹) and aromatic ring (1610, 1450 cm⁻¹). The ¹H NMR has a COOH proton at 10.5 ppm, an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, 2H each) indicating para substitution, and aliphatic signals (2.9 ppm benzylic CH, 1.7 ppm CH₂, 1.4 ppm CH–CH₃ doublet, 0.9 ppm CH₃ triplet) matching a sec-butyl group. These data are consistent only with a para-sec-butyl substituted benzoic acid.; answer: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\nCoT agent SrnR, analyzing reaction conditions, thinking: Red phosphorus and HI constitute strong reducing/decarboxylating conditions. Carboxylic acids under these conditions are reduced/lose CO₂, converting 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into the corresponding hydrocarbon. The aromatic ring and sec-butyl substituent remain intact, giving sec-butylbenzene.; answer: Sub-task 4: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid undergoes reductive decarboxylation with red P and HI to yield sec-butylbenzene.\nDebate agent yO20, round 0, identifying final product, thinking: The acid (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) decarboxylates under red P/HI to give the corresponding sec-butylbenzene.
