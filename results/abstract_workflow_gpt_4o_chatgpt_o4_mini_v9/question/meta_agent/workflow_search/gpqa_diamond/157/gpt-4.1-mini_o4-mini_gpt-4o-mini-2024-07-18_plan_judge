Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_157
proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in a dimerizing transcription factor typically retains the ability to dimerize with the wild-type subunit but generates nonfunctional complexes that cannot activate transcription. None of the provided options (loss of dimerization, aggregation, degradation, gain-of-function) describe this mechanism.

Answer:None of the above
[TOO_HARD]
Please include an option describing intact heterodimer formation with nonfunctional complexes (i.e., mutant–wild-type dimers that are inactive and cannot be phosphorylated or translocate to the nucleus).
Extracted answer: None of the above
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain allows mutant and wild-type subunits to form nonfunctional heterodimers that sequester the wild-type protein, producing a loss-of-function phenotype. Among the choices, only “protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype” approximates this mechanism of inactive complex formation.
