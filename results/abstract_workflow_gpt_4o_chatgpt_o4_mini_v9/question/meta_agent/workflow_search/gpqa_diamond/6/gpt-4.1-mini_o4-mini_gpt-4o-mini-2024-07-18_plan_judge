Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_6
proposed answer: Threshold energy E_γ ≃ (m_e c^2)^2/ε ≃ (0.511 MeV)^2/(10⁻³ eV) ≃ 2.6×10^14 eV ≃ 2.6×10^5 GeV, matching choice 3.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_6
proposed answer: Threshold energy for γγ→e⁺e⁻ is E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)² / ε ≃ (5.11×10⁵ eV)² /10⁻³ eV ≃2.61×10¹⁴ eV =2.61×10⁵ GeV. The closest provided option is 2.6×10⁵ GeV (choice C).
