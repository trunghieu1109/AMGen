Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_174
proposed answer: From Sub-task 5 the fraction at θ=30° was found to be 1/4 and from Sub-task 6 the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴. Among the given options, only choice 3 (C) matches these results.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_174
proposed answer: The radiation pattern is dipolar with f(λ,θ)∝λ⁻⁴sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin²30°=¼, so fraction=1/4 and λ-dependence=λ⁻⁴, matching choice 3 (C).
