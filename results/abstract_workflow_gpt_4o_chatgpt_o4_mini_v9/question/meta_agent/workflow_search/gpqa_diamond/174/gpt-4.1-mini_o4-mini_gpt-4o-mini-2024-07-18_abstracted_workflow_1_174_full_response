We know that any radiating oscillating charge distribution is characterized by its oscillation frequency (or wavelength λ), its geometrical symmetry axis (z–axis) which defines the polar angle θ for emission, the total radiated power A (the maximum of the angular distribution), and the functional dependence of the differential power dP/dΩ on θ and λ.; answer: Relevant physical quantities for this system:\n1. Oscillation frequency ω (or equivalently wavelength λ = 2πc/ω).\n2. Geometry: spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry axis along z–axis defines polar angle θ.\n3. Total (maximum) radiated power A, occurring at the angle where the radiation pattern peaks.\n4. Differential radiated power per unit solid angle, dP/dΩ = A·f(θ,λ), where f captures:\n   a. Angular dependence (e.g. ∝sin²θ for a dipole-like/quadrupole-like pattern arising from spheroidal geometry).\n   b. Wavelength (frequency) dependence (typically a power law ∝λ⁻⁴ or ∝ω⁴, set by the multipole order of the radiation).\nCoT-SC agent O13z, classifying radiation pattern, thinking: For a spheroidal charge oscillation the dominant far‐field is dipolar. Electric dipole radiation has angular pattern ∝sin²θ and power ∝ω⁴, hence ∝λ⁻⁴.; answer: Electric dipole radiation pattern: f(λ,θ) ∝ sin²θ / λ⁴ (sin²θ angular dependence, inverse fourth‐power wavelength dependence).\nCoT-SC agent Uo8p, classifying radiation pattern, thinking: Based on the spheroidal oscillating charge treated as a small dipole radiator, the dominant multipole is electric dipole, giving an angular dependence ∝sin²θ. Radiation power scales with frequency to the fourth power (ω⁴) or equivalently λ⁻⁴. The maximum occurs at θ=90°, so f(λ,θ)=(sin²θ)/(1)·λ⁻⁴.; answer: The radiation pattern is that of an electric dipole: f(λ,θ) ∝ sin²θ · λ⁻⁴.\nCoT-SC agent Xuqs, classifying radiation pattern, thinking: From sub‐task 1 we know the spheroidal oscillating charge produces a dipole‐like radiation pattern. The dominant multipole is the electric dipole, giving an angular distribution ∝sin²θ and a frequency (wavelength) dependence ∝ω⁴ (hence ∝λ⁻⁴).; answer: The radiation pattern is that of an electric dipole: f(θ,λ) ∝ sin²θ · λ⁻⁴\nCoT agent MSf3, deriving functional form, thinking: The radiation from a spheroidal oscillating charge is dominated by its electric dipole moment along z. In the far field dP/dΩ for a dipole p₀e^{−iωt} is (μ₀p₀²ω⁴sin²θ)/(32π²c).  Substituting ω=2πc/λ gives the λ⁻⁴ dependence and sin²θ angular pattern.; answer: f(λ,θ) = (μ₀\u2009p₀²\u2009ω⁴\u2009sin²θ)/(32π²\u2009c)\n         = (μ₀\u2009p₀²\u2009(2πc)⁴\u2009sin²θ)/(32π²\u2009c\u2009λ⁴)\n         ∝ sin²θ\u2009/\u2009λ⁴\nCoT agent AELq, determining max power and angle, thinking: Given f(λ,θ)∝sin²θ/λ⁴, the maximum occurs when sin²θ=1 ⇒ θ=90°. Plugging that into the dipole radiation formula gives A = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴)/(32π² c) = (μ₀ p₀² (2πc)⁴)/(32π² c λ⁴).; answer: A = (μ₀\u2009p₀²\u2009ω⁴)/(32π²\u2009c) = (μ₀\u2009p₀²\u2009(2πc)⁴)/(32π²\u2009c\u2009λ⁴); θ_max = 90°\nCoT agent O7ad, calculating fraction at 30 degrees, thinking: The angular dependence is f(θ)∝sin²θ. The maximum at θ=90° gives sin²90°=1. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4. Thus the fraction of A at 30° is 1/4.; answer: 1/4\nCoT agent wNze, determining wavelength dependence, thinking: For an oscillating charge distribution dominated by its electric dipole moment, the far‐field radiated power per unit solid angle scales with ω^4\u2009sin^2θ. Substituting ω=2πc/λ gives a λ^{-4} dependence.; answer: The wavelength dependence factor of the radiated power f(λ,θ) is λ^(-4).\nDebate agent B1W0, round 0, comparing with choices, thinking: From Sub-task 5 we have fraction = 1/4.
