Key quantities include the charge Q, dipole moment p(t), oscillation frequency ω, wavelength λ, wave number k, observation angle θ, and far-field approximations. Radiation arises from the time‐varying dipole (and higher multipoles), giving dP/dΩ ∝ ω^4|p₀|² sin²θ/c³ ∝ λ⁻⁴ sin²θ. No missing info prevents this basic multipole analysis.; answer: Key physical quantities and relationships:\n1) Charge distribution: total charge Q, spheroid semi-axes (a,b) with symmetry along z.\n2) Oscillation: dipole moment p(t)=p₀ e^{−iωt} along z (p₀∝Q×oscillation amplitude).\n3) Frequency–wavelength: ω=2πc/λ, wave number k=2π/λ.\n4) Far-field (radiation zone) electric field: E(θ)∝(k²p₀/r)sinθ e^{i(kr−ωt)}, magnetic field B=E×n/c.\n5) Radiated power per unit solid angle:\n   dP/dΩ = (μ₀ω⁴|p₀|²/(32π²c)) sin²θ ∝ λ⁻⁴ sin²θ.\n6) Angular dependence: maximum at θ=90°, zero on axis; fraction at θ=30°: sin²30°=¼.\nThus f(λ,θ)=const·λ⁻⁴ sin²θ, and the key observables are Q, p₀, ω (or λ), θ, and the radiated power pattern sin²θ.\nCoT-SC agent y1Tx, classifying radiation nature, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we have dP/dΩ ∝ λ⁻⁴ sin²θ, which is the hallmark angular pattern of electric dipole radiation: zero on the axis, maximum normal to it. The spheroidal oscillating charge behaves like a time‐varying dipole along z, giving a sin²θ radiation pattern symmetric about the z‐axis.; answer: The radiation is predominantly electric dipole radiation with an angular distribution dP/dΩ ∝ sin²θ: it vanishes along the symmetry axis (θ=0° and 180°) and peaks at θ=90°.\nCoT-SC agent Futr, classifying radiation nature, thinking: Sub-task 1 established that the dominant term is an oscillating dipole along z, giving far-field power dP/dΩ ∝ λ⁻⁴ sin²θ. That identifies the radiation as electric dipole radiation. Its angular distribution has the symmetry of the dipole: zero on the axis (θ=0,π), maximum in the equatorial plane (θ=90°). No additional multipoles or asymmetries were invoked, so classification is clear.; answer: The radiation is electric dipole radiation. Its angular power pattern in the radiation zone is proportional to sin²θ about the symmetry (z) axis, with nulls along the axis (θ=0,180°) and maximum emission in the plane θ=90°.\nCoT-SC agent GXSj, classifying radiation nature, thinking: From the dipole‐like oscillation along the z‐axis we found dP/dΩ∝λ⁻⁴sin²θ, which is precisely the angular pattern of electric dipole (E1) radiation: zero on axis and maximum in the equatorial plane. No higher multipoles contribute at lowest order for this symmetric oscillation.; answer: The radiation is dominantly electric dipole (E1) in nature, with an angular distribution dP/dΩ∝sin²θ: zero along the symmetry (z) axis and maximum at θ=90°.\nCoT agent ThAS, identifying wavelength dependence, thinking: The oscillating spheroidal charge acts as a time-varying electric dipole along z. Dipole radiation in the far zone yields dP/dΩ∝ω⁴|p₀|² sin²θ∝λ⁻⁴ sin²θ.
