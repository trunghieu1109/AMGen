    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on fraction of max power at theta=30 degrees. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Vcbg:
The angular distribution for a dipole oscillator is f(λ,θ) ∝ sin²θ, with maximum at θ = 90°. Thus the fraction at θ = 30° is sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.

### answer by Final Decision Agent Vcbg:
1/4

### Sub-task 6: Determine the possible functional form of f(lambda, theta) with respect to wavelength dependence consistent with radiation mechanism and spheroidal oscillation, based on Sub-task 3 and 4 outputs. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vb3E:
Based on dipole radiation from a spheroidal oscillating charge, we have dP/dΩ∝ω⁴|p₀|²sin²θ and ω=2πc/λ, so the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴. Combined with the sin²θ angular factor, the functional form is f(λ,θ)=Cλ⁻⁴sin²θ, where C encodes the dipole amplitude.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent vb3E:
f(λ,θ)=C λ^{-4} sin^{2}θ

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated fraction of maximum power at theta=30 degrees and the wavelength dependence form of f(lambda, theta) with the given multiple-choice options, and select the correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The radiation pattern is dipolar with f(λ,θ)∝λ⁻⁴sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin²30°=¼, so fraction=1/4 and λ-dependence=λ⁻⁴, matching choice 3 (C).
