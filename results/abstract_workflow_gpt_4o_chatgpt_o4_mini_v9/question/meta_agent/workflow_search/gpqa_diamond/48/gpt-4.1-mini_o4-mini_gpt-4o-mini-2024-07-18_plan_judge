Question: Example(question='Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.\n1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A\n(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C', choice1='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice2='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', choice3='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice4='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Comparing the predicted products A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, and C = 4-methylenehexanal to the four choices shows that no single choice matches all three. Choice1 matches B and C, choice3 matches A and C. Each of those matches two out of three predicted products.

Answer:None of the choices matches all three predicted products; the closest are choice1 (B and C correct) and choice3 (A and C correct).
Extracted answer: None of the choices matches all three predicted products; the closest are choice1 (B and C correct) and choice3 (A and C correct).
Correct answer: 0
