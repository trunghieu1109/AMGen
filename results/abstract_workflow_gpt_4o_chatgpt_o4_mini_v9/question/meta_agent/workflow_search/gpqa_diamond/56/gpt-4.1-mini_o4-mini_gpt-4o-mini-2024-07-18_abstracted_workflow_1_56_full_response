In low-energy (50 MeV) electron–nucleus elastic scattering, only the lowest few partial waves contribute significantly, so higher-ℓ shifts can be ignored.; answer: The given phase shifts are δ₀=90° (ℓ=0, s-wave), δ₁=67° (ℓ=1, p-wave), δ₂=55° (ℓ=2, d-wave), δ₃=30° (ℓ=3, f-wave), and δ₄=13° (ℓ=4, g-wave) in the context of elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. As specified, only these five partial-wave phase shifts are relevant and all higher-ℓ contributions are neglected.\nCoT agent qA7B, analyzing physical meaning and formula, thinking: The phase shifts δℓ quantify the additional phase each partial wave (ℓth spherical wave) acquires due to the scattering potential compared to free propagation. In the partial-wave expansion the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ)=1/(2ik) Σℓ (2ℓ+1)[e^{2iδℓ}−1]Pℓ(cosθ). Equivalently, f(θ)=1/k Σℓ (2ℓ+1)e^{iδℓ}sinδℓ Pℓ(cosθ). For the forward direction (θ=0) Pℓ(1)=1, so the imaginary part of f(0) is Im\u2009f(0)=1/k Σℓ (2ℓ+1)sin^2δℓ, summing only ℓ=0–4 as given.; answer: The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by Im\u2009f(0)=1/k Σ_{ℓ=0}^4 (2ℓ+1)sin^2δℓ.\nCoT agent D12G, deriving scattering amplitude expression, thinking: To derive the forward (θ=0) scattering amplitude we start from the standard partial‐wave expansion:  \nf(θ) = 1/(2ik) Σ_{ℓ=0}^∞ (2ℓ+1)[e^{2iδℓ}−1]Pℓ(cosθ).\nFor θ=0, Pℓ(1)=1.  Write e^{2iδℓ}−1=2i e^{iδℓ} sinδℓ, so\nf(0) = 1/(2ik) Σ_{ℓ}(2ℓ+1)·2i e^{iδℓ} sinδℓ = 1/k Σ_{ℓ}(2ℓ+1)e^{iδℓ} sinδℓ.\nThe imaginary part picks out sinδℓ·sinδℓ=sin^2δℓ, giving\nIm\u2009f(0) = 1/k Σ_{ℓ=0}^4 (2ℓ+1) sin^2δℓ.; answer: Using the partial-wave expansion and Pℓ(1)=1, the imaginary part of the forward amplitude is\nIm\u2009f(0) = (1/k) Σ_{ℓ=0}^4 (2ℓ+1) sin^2δℓ.\nCoT agent GD8g, converting phase shifts to radians, thinking: To convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180. Applying this to each phase shift gives:; answer: δ₀=90°→1.5708 rad, δ₁=67°→1.1694 rad, δ₂=55°→0.9599 rad, δ₃=30°→0.5236 rad, δ₄=13°→0.2269 rad\nCoT agent s3gW, calculating imaginary part of scattering amplitude, thinking: We use Im f(0)=1/k ∑_{l=0}^4(2l+1) sin^2δ_l. Convert δ to radians, compute sin^2: 1, 0.848, 0.671, 0.25, 0.051. Weighted sum Σ=(1*1)+(3*0.848)+(5*0.671)+(7*0.25)+(9*0.051)=9.109. For non‐relativistic electrons, k=√(2mE)/ħ≈0.0362 fm^-1 so 1/k≈27.6 fm. Then Im f(0)=27.6*9.109≈251.3 fm, matching choice C.; answer: C)\nCoT agent xKLb, ensuring unit consistency, thinking: We previously computed Im f(0)=27.6\u2009fm×9.109≈251.3\u2009fm using k in fm⁻¹. Since k was expressed in fm⁻¹, 1/k in fm, the result is already in femtometers.
