        "response": "The NMR and reaction data require a styryl epoxide with a para-methyl substituent that undergoes Meinwald rearrangement under DABCO/heat to give a conjugated chalcone. Among the choices, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane features both the para-methylphenyl ring and the styryl oxirane needed for this transformation. Thus Compound X is best identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\nAnswer:Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (Choice B) because it uniquely matches the para-methylstyryl epoxide framework required by the NMR data and reaction pathway.",
