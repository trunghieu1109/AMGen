Question: Example(question='In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.', choice1='2-styrylepoxide', choice2='2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', choice3='2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', choice4='2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_78
proposed answer: The NMR data show a conjugated ketone (δ197.7), two distinct methyl singlets, trans‐olefinic doublets, and a para‐disubstituted aromatic pattern. These match the Meinwald rearrangement product of 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane under DABCO at 403 K. Thus, choice D best fits all spectral, formula, and reaction conditions.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_78
proposed answer: The NMR and reaction data require a styryl epoxide with a para-methyl substituent that undergoes Meinwald rearrangement under DABCO/heat to give a conjugated chalcone. Among the choices, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane features both the para-methylphenyl ring and the styryl oxirane needed for this transformation. Thus Compound X is best identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Answer:Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (Choice B) because it uniquely matches the para-methylstyryl epoxide framework required by the NMR data and reaction pathway.
