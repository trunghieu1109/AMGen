Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_170
proposed answer: The derived increasing order is 4<6<2<3<1<5, but none of the provided choices matches this sequence.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please verify the ranking of para-isomer yields or re-examine the choice options for a possible typo.
Extracted answer: [TOO_HARD]
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_44_170
proposed answer: The derived order of increasing para-isomer yield is 4<6<2<3<1<5. None of the given options (A–D) matches this sequence exactly.

Answer:None of the provided choices matches the correct order 4<6<2<3<1<5.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide experimental para/ortho distribution data for the COOH and COOR substituents to resolve their relative directing strengths.
Extracted answer: None of the provided choices matches the correct order 4<6<2<3<1<5.
Correct answer: 3
