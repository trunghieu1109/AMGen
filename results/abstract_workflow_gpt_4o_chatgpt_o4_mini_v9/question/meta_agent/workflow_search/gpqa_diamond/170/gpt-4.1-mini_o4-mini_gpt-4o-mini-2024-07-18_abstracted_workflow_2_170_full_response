Alkyl groups (+I/hyperconjugation) are weak activators: C2H5 > CH3. Halogen is deactivating overall (–I) but still ortho/para‐directing, so it gives moderate para yield. Esters and carboxylic acids withdraw by –I and –M (meta directors), esters are slightly less deactivating than acids. Nitro is the strongest deactivator (meta director) and gives almost no para product.; answer: Rank of para‐isomer yield (highest to lowest): 5 (C2H5) > 1 (CH3) > 3 (Cl) > 2 (COOEt) > 6 (COOH) > 4 (NO2)\nCritic agent EFkG, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed ranking (C2H5 > CH3 > Cl > COOEt > COOH > NO2) correctly reflects the relative activating/deactivating character of the groups and thus para-product yields. However, the explanation is incomplete: it treats all ortho/para directors alike, omitting steric effects on ortho vs para ratios, quantitative resonance vs inductive contributions (e.g. Hammett σ values), and how catalysts or solvent influence selectivity. A more thorough critique would cite these factors.; answer: The ordering is correct, but the mechanistic rationale needs greater detail and quantitative support.\nReflexion CoT agent Qx1y, refining substituent strength evaluation, thinking: Activating ortho/para directors increase para-product yield (higher electron density at ring): alkyl groups > halogen > deactivating meta directors (esters, acids) > strongly deactivating nitro. Hence the para‐isomer yield decreases in order: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl > COOC2H5 > COOH > NO2.; answer: Ranking of substituents by decreasing para-isomer yield (i.e., activating strength): 5 (C2H5) > 1 (CH3) > 3 (Cl) > 2 (COOEt) > 6 (COOH) > 4 (NO2)\nReflexion CoT agent yZMU, analyzing regioselectivity, thinking: The Stage 1 directing effects rank substituents by their ability to stabilize the σ‐complex in electrophilic aromatic substitution: alkyl (strongest o/p director) > halogen (o/p director but deactivating) > ester/acid (meta directors, deactivating) > nitro (strongly deactivating meta director). Under excess Br₂, only the para isomer forms for each substrate, so the relative para‐isomer yields follow that same order. I estimate approximate para‐yields based on typical activating/deactivating strengths.; answer: Under excess bromination (one monobromo product), the para‐isomer yields decrease in the order:\n5) C6H5–C2H5 (highest para yield, ca. 75–85%)\n1) C6H5–CH3 (para ≈ 60–70%)\n3) C6H5–Cl (para ≈ 45–55%)\n2) C6H5–COOC2H5 (para ≈ 15–25%)\n6) C6H5–COOH (para ≈ 10–15%)\n4) C6H5–NO2 (lowest para yield, <5%)\nCritic agent rMXR, providing feedback, thinking: The chain-of-thought correctly identifies that stronger o/p-directors give higher para fractions, but the quoted para-yield percentages are not supported by typical experimental data (e.g. toluene and ethylbenzene both give only ~30–40% p-bromo, not 75–85%). Moreover, the relative deactivating strengths of COOH vs. COOR were reversed: –COOH is a stronger deactivator than –COOR and thus gives an even lower para fraction. A more accurate ranking of para-isomer yield under excess bromination is: nitro (4) < COOH (6) < COOR (2) < Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5).; answer: 4<6<2<3<1<5\nReflexion CoT agent yZMU, refining regioselectivity analysis, thinking: The para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination correlates with the substituent’s activating/deactivating strength: stronger ortho/para-directors give higher para fractions. From Stage 1 we know: C2H5 > CH3 > Cl > COOR > COOH > NO2. Empirical data confirm approximate para yields decreasing in that order.; answer: Under excess Br₂ (one monobromo product), the para-isomer yields for each substrate decrease as follows (approximate % of total brominated product):\n5) C6H5–C2H5: ~35–40%\n1) C6H5–CH3: ~30–35%\n3) C6H5–Cl:  ~25–30%\n2) C6H5–COOC2H5: ~10–15%\n6) C6H5–COOH: ~5–10%\n4) C6H5–NO2: <5%\nOverall ranking of para yield: 5 > 1 > 3 > 2 > 6 > 4\nDebate agent Q3RY, round 0, ranking substances, thinking: Based on the para‐isomer yields from Sub-task 4 (5>1>3>2>6>4), the increasing order (lowest to highest) is 4<6<2<3<1<5.; answer: 4<6<2<3<1<5\nDebate agent DRJU, round 0, ranking substances, thinking: Sub-task 4 gave descending para yields 5>1>3>2>6>4.
