A monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ incident normally (along the z‐axis) on this aperture produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the far field, with rotational symmetry and characteristic Airy‐disk intensity maxima and minima.; answer: In the limit N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The physical setup is a normally incident monochromatic plane wave (wavelength λ) on this aperture, producing the far‐field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern (Airy pattern) along angles θ from the z‐axis.\nCoT-SC agent Nqz1, deriving diffraction pattern characteristics, thinking: For a circular aperture of radius a, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. Its intensity minima occur where the Bessel function J₁(u) = 0 with u = k a sinθ ≃ k a θ (small-angle). The m-th zero of J₁ is pₘ, so k a θₘ = pₘ ⇒ (2π/λ)·a·θₘ = pₘ ⇒ θₘ = pₘ·λ/(2πa).; answer: θₘ = pₘ·λ/(2πa), where pₘ is the m-th zero of J₁ (p₁≈3.8317, p₂≈7.0156, …).\nCoT-SC agent r9fr, deriving diffraction pattern characteristics, thinking: For a circular aperture of radius a, the far-field amplitude is proportional to J1(ka sinθ)/(ka sinθ). Minima occur where the numerator J1(ka sinθ) = 0, i.e. ka sinθ = x_m, the m-th zero of J1. With k=2π/λ and small angles sinθ≈θ, this gives θ_m = x_mλ/(2πa). The first zero x_1≈3.8317 yields θ_1≈3.8317λ/(2πa)=1.22λ/(2a)=0.61λ/a.; answer: θ_m ≈ x_m λ/(2π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1 (e.g. x_1=3.8317 gives θ_1≈0.61 λ/a)\nCoT-SC agent Z3g3, deriving diffraction pattern characteristics, thinking: The limiting case N→∞ gives a circular aperture of radius a. The far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern is described by the Airy pattern, whose intensity minima occur at angles for which the first‐order Bessel function J1 goes to zero. With k=2π/λ and small angles (sinθ≈θ), the condition k\u2009a\u2009θn = αn (the nth zero of J1) yields θn = αn\u2009λ/(2π\u2009a).; answer: θn = αn\u2009λ/(2π\u2009a), where αn is the nth zero of J1 (e.g. for the first minimum α1≈3.8317 → θ1 ≈0.61\u2009λ/a).\nReflexion CoT agent SyeZ, calculating angular distance between first two minima, thinking: For a circular aperture, the m-th minimum occurs at θm = pm λ/(2πa) where p1≈3.8317 and p2≈7.0156 are the first two zeros of J1. Thus Δθ = (p2–p1)λ/(2πa) = (7.0156–3.8317)λ/(2πa) ≈3.1839/(2π) λ/a ≈0.506 λ/a.; answer: D)\nCritic agent xk9g, providing feedback, thinking: The solution correctly identifies the first two zeros of J₁ (3.8317 and 7.0156), computes their difference (3.1839), and applies Δθ=(p₂–p₁)λ/(2πa)=3.1839/(2π)·λ/a≈0.506λ/a under the small‐angle approximation. The derivation is both correct and complete.; answer: 0.506 λ/a\nReflexion CoT agent SyeZ, refining angular distance calculation, thinking: For a circular aperture, the first two minima occur at zeros p₁≈3.8317 and p₂≈7.0156 of J₁.
