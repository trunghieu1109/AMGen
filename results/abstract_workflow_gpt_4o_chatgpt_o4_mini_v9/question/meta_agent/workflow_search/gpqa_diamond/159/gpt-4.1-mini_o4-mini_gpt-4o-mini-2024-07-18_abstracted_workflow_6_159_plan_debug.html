    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated angular distance with the provided multiple-choice options: 1.220 λ/a, 0.610 λ/a, 0.500 λ/a, 0.506 λ/a. Identify the correct choice that matches the theoretical result. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent m2qT:
The theoretical angular separation Δθ ≈0.506 λ/a matches option 4, choice D.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent QSrH:
The theoretical angular separation Δθ≈0.506 λ/a matches option 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent dKh6:
The calculated angular separation Δθ≈0.506 λ/a matches the provided option D) 0.506 λ/a.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent SmEC:
From Sub-task 3, the angular separation Δθ≈0.506 λ/a, which corresponds to choice 4.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent m2qT:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent QSrH:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent dKh6:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct multiple-choice answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
