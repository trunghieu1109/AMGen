Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_159
proposed answer: The theoretical result for the angular distance between the first two minima in the limit N→∞ is Δθ≈0.506 λ/a, which exactly matches option D).

proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, the first two minima occur at θ₁≈0.610 λ/a and θ₂≈1.117 λ/a. Their separation is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁≈(1.117−0.610) λ/a≈0.507 λ/a, which matches choice 4 (0.506 λ/a).
