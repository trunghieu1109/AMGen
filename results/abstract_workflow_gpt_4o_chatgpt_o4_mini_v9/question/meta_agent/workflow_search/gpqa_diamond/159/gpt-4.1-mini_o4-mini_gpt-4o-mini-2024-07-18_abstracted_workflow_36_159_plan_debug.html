    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima using the results from Sub-task 4, express it in terms of λ and a, then compare the result with the given choices to identify the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 84Zk:
From Sub-task 4, θ₁≈0.610 λ/a and θ₂≈1.117 λ/a. The angular distance Δθ=θ₂–θ₁≈(1.117–0.610)λ/a=0.507λ/a, which matches choice 4 (0.506 λ/a).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent uJtA:
From Sub-task 4, θ₁ = 0.610 λ/a and θ₂ = 1.117 λ/a. The angular separation Δθ = θ₂ − θ₁ = (1.117 − 0.610) λ/a ≈ 0.507 λ/a, which matches choice 4 (0.506 λ/a).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent obQ8:
From Sub-task 4 we have θ₁≈0.610 λ/a and θ₂≈1.117 λ/a. Their difference is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁≈(1.117−0.610) λ/a=0.507 λ/a ≈0.506 λ/a, which matches choice 4.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the angular distance between the first two minima and select the correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
