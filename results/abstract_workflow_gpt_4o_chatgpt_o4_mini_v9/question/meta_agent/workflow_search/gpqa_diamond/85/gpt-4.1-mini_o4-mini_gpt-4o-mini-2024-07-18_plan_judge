Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_85
proposed answer: Sub-task 4 established that A is the R-configured acid and B is the S-configured acid, which corresponds to choice 4.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_85
proposed answer: Comparing predicted stereochemical outcomes: LiBH4 via non‐chelating Felkin–Anh control gives the (R)-lactone so A must be the (R)-configured γ-keto acid; BH3 via chelation control gives the (S)-lactone so B must be the (S)-configured γ-keto acid. Only choice 4 matches these assignments.
