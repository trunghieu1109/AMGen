In the (S) isomer this center has the ethyl, hydrogen, and the rest of the γ-keto acid backbone arranged so as to give S configuration; in the (R) isomer they are arranged oppositely. Both molecules possess a carboxylic acid at C-1, a ketone (as part of a γ-oxo acid) at C-5, and an isobutoxy substituent at C-5 (forming a hemiketal). These functional groups determine which reducing agent will act where: LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the ketone to an alcohol (leading to subsequent cyclization to the lactone), whereas BH3 will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid to an alcohol (also enabling lactonization). The absolute configuration at C-3 then dictates the final stereochemistry in the tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one products.; answer: A and B are a pair of enantiomeric γ-hemiketal acids: A\u2009=\u2009(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B\u2009=\u2009(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Each has one stereocenter at C3 (bearing the ethyl group), a carboxylic acid at C1, a ketone/hemiketal at C5, and an isobutoxy protecting group. LiBH4 selectively reduces the C5 ketone in A, BH3 selectively reduces the C1 acid in B, and the respective configurations at C3 then lead to the observed (R) or (S) products upon cyclization.\nCoT agent ZBPf, analyzing reducing agents LiBH4 and BH3, thinking: The question asks for a mechanistic and stereochemical comparison of LiBH4 versus BH3 reductions on molecules containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester. Key points: LiBH4 is a relatively small, non-chelating hydride donor that will reduce both esters and acids (though esters more slowly) and whose Li+ can coordinate weakly to carbonyl oxygens. BH3 (borane) is much more chemoselective for carboxylic acids, forming a discreet boronate complex with the acid OH and delivering hydride very rapidly to the acid carbonyl, often leaving esters untouched until workup or intramolecular cyclization. In each case, the nature of the metal–oxygen interaction (Li+ versus B) plus the steric environment around the prochiral carbonyl dictates which face the hydride approaches, thus controlling the handedness of the resulting lactone.; answer: LiBH4 vs. BH3 Reactivity and Stereochemical Effects:\n\n1. Chemoselectivity:\n   • LiBH4: a strong, small hydride donor that will reduce both carboxylic acids and esters (though esters more slowly). It does not strongly discriminate between the two functional groups.  \n   • BH3: highly selective for carboxylic acids. BH3 coordinates to the acid’s hydroxyl to form a boronate intermediate and reduces the acid much faster than the ester, often leaving the ester intact until intramolecular cyclization occurs.\n\n2. Metal–Oxygen Coordination and Hydride Delivery:\n   • LiBH4: Li+ can weakly chelate to one or both carbonyl oxygens but offers only limited directionality. The small size of BH4– allows hydride delivery from the less hindered face of the carbonyl, but without a strong, rigid chelate.\n   • BH3: B–O coordination is strong and directional. The boronate ester intermediate fixes the geometry of the carboxylate, enforcing a well-defined transition state in which the hydride is delivered from the side opposite bulky substituents.\n\n3. Stereochemical Outcomes:\n   • With LiBH4, the less hindered face of the acid carbonyl is attacked but Li+ chelation can be weak and dynamic, so the incoming hydride often approaches the re face, giving predominantly the R-configured lactone.\n   • With BH3, the boronate chelate fixes the acid moiety so that hydride delivery occurs almost exclusively from the si face (the face opposite the larger substituents), furnishing the S-configured lactone.\n\nSummary:\n   • LiBH4 is less chemoselective and gives hydride approach controlled mainly by sterics and weak Li+ chelation, leading to R-lactone.  \n   • BH3 is highly acid-selective, forms a rigid boronate intermediate, and delivers hydride from the opposite face, leading to S-lactone.\nCoT agent QbT9, analyzing product structures and stereochemistry, thinking: The question asks for an analysis of how the stereochemistry of the two lactone products reflects both the configuration of the starting acids and the behavior of the two reducing agents. LiBH4 and BH3 each reduce a carboxylic acid to the corresponding primary alcohol, which then cyclizes to give the tetrahydro‐2H‐pyran‐2‐one. Both reductions proceed without inversion at the chiral α-carbon bearing the ethyl substituent, so the R- or S-configuration of the starting acid is directly transferred to the lactone. BH3 is chosen for its high chemoselectivity toward carboxylic acids (avoiding other functional groups), whereas LiBH4, though more reactive, can also cleanly produce the alcohol for cyclization under controlled conditions. Thus each product’s absolute configuration mirrors that of its precursor.; answer: Both LiBH4 and BH3 reductions preserve the configuration at the α-carbon. The (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one arises from the (R)-configured acid (A) via LiBH4, and the (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one arises from the (S)-configured acid (B) via BH3. BH3’s high selectivity for carboxylic acids prevents over-reduction of other functional groups, while LiBH4, under controlled conditions, likewise reduces only the acid to an alcohol that cyclizes with retention of stereochemistry.\nReflexion CoT agent fjPF, correlating stereochemistry and reaction outcomes, thinking: The LiBH4 reduction preserves the C-3 configuration and gives the R-lactone, so A must be the R-configured acid. The BH3 reduction likewise preserves configuration and gives the S-lactone, so B must be the S-configured acid. This matches choice 4.; answer: D)\nCritic agent drVe, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation is logically consistent and complete. Both LiBH4 and BH3 reduce the carboxyl group without affecting the remote stereocenter, so an R-configured acid yields the R-lactone and an S-configured acid yields the S-lactone. Therefore assigning A as the R-acid and B as the S-acid (choice 4) is correct.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent fjPF, refining correlation, thinking: LiBH4 reduction of A gives the (R)-lactone without changing the C3 stereocenter, so A must be the R-configured acid. BH3 reduction of B gives the (S)-lactone, so B must be the S-configured acid. This matches choice 4.; answer: D)\nDebate agent wdJv, round 0, evaluating choices, thinking: Sub-task 4 established that A is the R-configured acid (giving (R)-lactone with LiBH4) and B is the S-configured acid (giving (S)-lactone with BH3), which aligns with choice 4.; answer: D)\nDebate agent 9vC9, round 0, evaluating choices, thinking: Sub-task 4 established that A must be the R-configured acid and B the S-configured acid.
