Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_95
proposed answer: From sub-task 5 we obtained S≈4×10^62 J/K, so the closest provided choice (10^59, 10^62, 10^65, 10^66 J/K) is 10^62 J/K.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_95
proposed answer: From the calculated entropy S ≃ 1×10^62 J/K, the closest order of magnitude among the choices (10^59, 10^62, 10^65, 10^66 J/K) is 10^62 J/K, which corresponds to option C).
