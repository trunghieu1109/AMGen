Here θ=10^(-17)° so θ_rad=10^(-17)*(π/180)≈1.745×10^(-19) radians, i.e. order of magnitude 10^(-19) rad.; answer: θ ≈ 1.7×10^(-19) radians (≈10^(-19) rad)\nCoT-SC agent Eypz, calculating physical radius, thinking: We use the small‐angle approximation D ≃ θ_rad × d. Converting d=10^10\u2009pc to meters gives d≈10^10×3.086×10^16\u2009m≈3×10^26\u2009m. Multiplying by θ≈1.7×10^−19\u2009rad yields D≈1.7×10^−19×3×10^26\u2009m≈5×10^7\u2009m for the diameter; the radius is half that, ≃2.5×10^7\u2009m.; answer: Physical diameter D ≃5×10^7\u2009m (radius ≃2.5×10^7\u2009m)\nCoT-SC agent HDk1, calculating physical radius, thinking: First convert distance from parsecs to meters: d=10^10\u2009pc×3.086×10^16\u2009m/pc≈3.09×10^26\u2009m. Then physical size ≈θ_rad×d≈1.7×10^−19×3.09×10^26\u2009m≈5.3×10^7\u2009m (as the diameter). The radius is half that, ≈2.6×10^7\u2009m.; answer: The event horizon’s physical diameter is ≈5×10^7\u2009m, corresponding to a radius of ≈2.5×10^7\u2009m.\nCoT-SC agent FPBA, calculating physical radius, thinking: We use the small‐angle formula S = θ_rad × d. Here θ_rad≈1.7×10^(–19) rad and d=10^10 pc ≈3.086×10^26 m. Thus S≈1.7×10^(–19)×3.086×10^26 m ≈5.25×10^7 m. This is the diameter; the radius is half that.; answer: Physical diameter ≈5×10^7\u2009m (radius ≈2.5×10^7\u2009m).\nReflexion CoT agent LQJF, estimating mass from radius, thinking: We use the Schwarzschild radius formula Rs=2GM/c². Given Rs≈2.5×10⁷\u2009m, c≈3×10⁸\u2009m/s, G≈6.67×10⁻¹¹\u2009m³/kg·s², then M=(c²Rs)/(2G)≈(9×10¹⁶·2.5×10⁷)/(2·6.67×10⁻¹¹)≈1.7×10³⁴\u2009kg, which is ≈8.5×10³\u2009solar masses.; answer: Estimate: M ≃1.7×10³⁴\u2009kg (≈8.5×10³\u2009M☉)\nCritic agent x1dM, providing feedback, thinking: The estimation correctly applies Rs=2GM/c² to find M≈1.7×10^34 kg (~8.5×10^3 M☉), but it relies on an approximate Rs from angular size and distance without quantifying measurement errors. It also assumes a non‐rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, ignores lensing, cosmological redshift and expansion, and potential deviations in horizon radius for a Kerr (spinning) black hole.; answer: Using Rs≈2.5×10^7 m, c²≈9×10^16 m²/s², G≈6.67×10^−11 m³/kg s² gives M=c²Rs/(2G)≈1.7×10^34 kg (~8.5×10^3 M☉). Limitations include uncertainties in θ and d, neglect of spin (Kerr metric), gravitational lensing, and cosmological effects.\nReflexion CoT agent LQJF, refining mass estimation, thinking: Use the Schwarzschild radius formula Rs = 2GM/c². With Rs ≃ 2.5×10^7\u2009m, c ≃ 3×10^8\u2009m/s, G ≃ 6.67×10^−11\u2009m³/kg·s², solve M = c²Rs/(2G) ≃ (9×10^16 × 2.5×10^7)/(2×6.67×10^−11) ≃ 1.7×10^34\u2009kg, or ≃8.5×10^3 solar masses.; answer: Estimate: M ≃1.7×10^34\u2009kg (≈8.5×10^3\u2009M☉)\nCoT agent jlLm, calculating entropy, thinking: We have radius r≃2.5×10^7 m so A=4πr²≃4π(2.5×10^7)²≃7.85×10^15 m².
