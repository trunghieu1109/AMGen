Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_13
proposed answer: Stronger dual crosslinking with DSG+PFA stabilizes protein–protein interactions and reduces capture of dynamic, transient TF–DNA contacts—characteristic of IKAROS “hit-and-run” binding at active promoters/enhancers. Thus peaks at these regulatory regions disappear under PFA+DSG fixation.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_13
proposed answer: Dual PFA+DSG fixation overly stabilizes protein–protein interactions and masks epitopes in multi-protein assemblies at open chromatin, preventing capture of transient IKAROS–DNA contacts that are most enriched at active regulatory elements. Therefore sites where IKAROS binds dynamically at active promoters and enhancers will lose peaks under dual fixation.
