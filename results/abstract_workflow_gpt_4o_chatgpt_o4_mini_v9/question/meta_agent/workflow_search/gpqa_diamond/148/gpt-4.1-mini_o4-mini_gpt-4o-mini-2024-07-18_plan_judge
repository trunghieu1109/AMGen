Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_148
proposed answer: Enantiomers would not separate in achiral NMR/LC and give distinct peaks; true diastereoisomers would show larger, non-coalescing shift differences; double coupling or precursor contamination would alter the mass or integrals. The reversible, equal-intensity peaks that coalesce at higher temperature are characteristic of slowly interconverting cis/trans amide-bond rotamers (conformational isomers).

proposed answer: The equal integrals for two closely spaced Î±-proton signals, separation into two peaks of identical mass on standard LC-MS (even at elevated T), and no change in coupling patterns rule out enantiomers (identical NMR/LC on achiral systems), double coupling (would alter splitting or mass), and precursor contamination (would show different mass or integration). Only diastereoisomers can give distinct NMR signals of equal integral, separable LC peaks, and identical MS. Therefore the crude sample is a mixture of diastereoisomers.
