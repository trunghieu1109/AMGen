None of the provided choices (Blue, Yellow, Red, Violet) correspond to green, so the correct absorbed color cannot be selected from the list without adding Green as an option.\n\nAnswer:Green\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease include \"Green\" among the options or clarify the intended mapping so the absorbed color can be selected.",
