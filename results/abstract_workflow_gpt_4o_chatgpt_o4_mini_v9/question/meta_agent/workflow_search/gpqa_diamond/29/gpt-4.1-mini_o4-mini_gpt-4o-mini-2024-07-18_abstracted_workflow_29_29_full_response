Rearranging gives λ = 1240 / E. Substituting E = 2.3393 eV yields λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm.; answer: Approximately 530 nm\nCoT-SC agent vzuq, identifying emitted light color, thinking: A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green region (495–570 nm) of the visible spectrum.; answer: Green\nCoT-SC agent 1BHy, identifying emitted light color, thinking: The calculated emission wavelength is approximately 530 nm, which falls within the green region of the visible spectrum (495–570 nm).; answer: The emitted light is green.\nCoT-SC agent uz3r, identifying emitted light color, thinking: Sub-task 1 gave λ ≈ 530 nm. Visible spectrum classification for ~530 nm corresponds to green (495-570 nm).; answer: Green\nReflexion CoT agent f6iI, determining absorbed light color and wavelength, thinking: The dye emits green light (~530 nm). In visible-light complementary pairs (red–cyan, green–magenta, blue–yellow), green’s complement is red. Thus the compound absorbs red light, around the mid–red region (~620–750 nm), typically centered near 650 nm.; answer: ~650 nm, Red\nDebate agent I6aY, round 0, matching absorbed color to choices, thinking: The dye emits green light, so it absorbs its complementary color, red. Among the options (A)Blue, (B)Yellow, (C)Red, (D)Violet, the correct match is Red.; answer: C)\nDebate agent M1T9, round 0, matching absorbed color to choices, thinking: The compound absorbs the complementary color to its emission (green), which is red.
