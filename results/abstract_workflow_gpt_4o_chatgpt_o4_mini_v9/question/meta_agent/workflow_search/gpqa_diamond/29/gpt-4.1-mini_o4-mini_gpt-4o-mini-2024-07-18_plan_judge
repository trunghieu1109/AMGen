Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_29
proposed answer: The absorption wavelength is calculated as λ = 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm, which falls in the green region. None of the provided choices (Blue, Yellow, Red, Violet) correspond to green, so the correct absorbed color cannot be selected from the list without adding Green as an option.

Answer:Green
[TOO_HARD]
Please include "Green" among the options or clarify the intended mapping so the absorbed color can be selected.
Extracted answer: Green
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_29
proposed answer: The dye emits green light (2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm), so it absorbs the complementary color to green, which is red.
