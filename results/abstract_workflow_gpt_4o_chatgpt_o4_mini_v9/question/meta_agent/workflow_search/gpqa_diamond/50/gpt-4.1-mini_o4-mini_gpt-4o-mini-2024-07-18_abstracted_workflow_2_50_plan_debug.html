{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the derived expression for the net potential energy from Sub-task 3 with the given multiple-choice options. Evaluate which formula correctly matches the derived expression, considering signs, coefficients, and denominators. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent pyfd:
The derived expression U = -½ k q² R/(d² - R²) exactly matches choice1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5KYo:
The derived expression U = -½ k q² R/(d² - R²) exactly matches choice1 (U = - (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent pyfd:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 5KYo:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on which multiple-choice formula matches the derived potential energy expression.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
