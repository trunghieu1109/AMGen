Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=0)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_50
proposed answer: The derived potential energy expression U = -½ k q² R/(d² - R²) exactly matches the form of choice1 (U = - (1/2) * k q² R/(d² - R²)), including the correct sign, coefficient, and denominator.
