{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on net potential energy expression. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 549p:
All debate agents agree by substituting the image charge q′=−(R/d)q and its location a=R²/d into U=(1/2)kqq′/(d−a), yielding U=−(1/2)kq²R/(d²−R²).

### answer by Final Decision Agent 549p:
Sub-task 5: U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated expression for net potential energy with the given choices to identify the correct formula for U. Justify the selection based on the derived formula and constants.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
