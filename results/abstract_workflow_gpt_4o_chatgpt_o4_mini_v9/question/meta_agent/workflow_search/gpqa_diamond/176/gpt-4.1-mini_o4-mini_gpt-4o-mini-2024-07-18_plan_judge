Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_176
proposed answer: Using the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law with equal temperatures gives L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The Doppler shift at 700 km/s affects the flux by less than 1%, which is negligible. Thus the luminosity ratio remains 2.25, matching choice ~2.25.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_176
proposed answer: From sub-task 3, the luminosity ratio equals (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The Doppler/relativistic correction at 700 km/s is negligible (<1%), so the final ratio remains ~2.25.
