For black‐body emitters, luminosity depends on surface area and temperature (Stefan–Boltzmann law). Equal peak wavelength implies equal surface temperature. Mass ratio does not directly enter the L–T–R relation. Thus luminosity ratio comes solely from the radius ratio squared.; answer: Sub-task 1 answer:  \n- Radius ratio (R1/R2 = 1.5): enters luminosity via surface area ∝ R², so L scales as (1.5)².  \n- Mass ratio (M1/M2 = 1.5): does not directly affect black-body luminosity calculation.  \n- Same peak wavelength ⇒ same surface temperature (Wien’s law), so T1 = T2 and cancels out in L ratio.  \nTherefore, for black bodies L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = 2.25.\nCoT-SC agent WYOc, interpreting equal peak wavelength, thinking: Wien’s displacement law states λ_max T = constant, so if both stars peak at the same λ_max, their surface temperatures must be equal. This equal T means in the Stefan–Boltzmann law L ∝ R^2 T^4 the T^4 factors cancel when taking the ratio.; answer: The identical peak wavelengths mean both stars have the same surface temperature, because Wien’s displacement law (λ_max T = constant) implies T1 = T2.\nCoT-SC agent d04U, interpreting equal peak wavelength, thinking: Given Wien’s displacement law (λ_max T = constant), identical peak wavelengths directly imply identical surface temperatures. No additional data is needed.; answer: Sub-task 2 answer: The fact that both stars have the same peak wavelength means, by Wien’s displacement law (λ_max T = constant), that their surface temperatures are equal (T1 = T2).\nCoT-SC agent gVoG, interpreting equal peak wavelength, thinking: Wien’s displacement law states λ_max·T = constant. If two stars share the same λ_max, their surface temperatures must be equal. This equality of T is key because in the Stefan–Boltzmann law L∝R²T⁴, the T⁴ terms cancel when comparing the two stars, leaving L proportional only to R².; answer: The identical peak wavelength in both spectra implies, via Wien’s displacement law, that the two stars have the same surface temperature.\nCoT agent xNkb, calculating luminosity ratio, thinking: For black-body stars, L ∝ R^2\u2009T^4. Given R1/R2 = 1.5 and T1 = T2, the temperature ratio term drops out, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.; answer: Luminosity ratio L1/L2 = 2.25.\nCoT agent f8GH, evaluating velocity effects, thinking: We assess the impact of radial velocities on observed luminosity via Doppler and relativistic beaming effects. With v=700\u2009km/s (β≈0.0023), the special‐relativistic Doppler factor D≈√[(1+β)/(1−β)]≈1.0023. Bolometric flux scales roughly as D^3, so the flux shift ≲0.7%. This is negligible compared to uncertainties in stellar radii, distances, and the 2.25 luminosity ratio. Hence no Doppler or relativistic correction is needed at this level of precision.; answer: Sub-task 4 answer: The radial velocities (0\u2009km/s vs. 700\u2009km/s) produce a Doppler factor of only ≈1.002, yielding a <1% change in observed flux. This effect is negligible for comparing intrinsic black-body luminosities, so no Doppler or relativistic corrections are necessary.\nDebate agent c4OK, round 0, debating final luminosity factor, thinking: From sub-task 3, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
