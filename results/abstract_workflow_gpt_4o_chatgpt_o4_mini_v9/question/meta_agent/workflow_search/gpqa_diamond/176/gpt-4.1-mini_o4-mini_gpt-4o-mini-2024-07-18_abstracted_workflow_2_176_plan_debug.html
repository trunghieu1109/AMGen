    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Combine luminosity ratio and velocity effect evaluation to finalize the factor by which Star_1&#39;s luminosity is greater than Star_2&#39;s, and compare this factor to the provided multiple-choice options. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent c4OK:
From sub-task 3, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. From sub-task 4, the Doppler/relativistic correction for v=700 km/s is &lt;1%, which is negligible. Thus the final luminosity ratio remains 2.25, matching choice ~2.25.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 2en9:
From sub-task 3 L1/L2=(1.5)^2=2.25; sub-task 4 shows Doppler shift &lt;1%, so negligible. Final luminosity ratioâ‰ˆ2.25, matching choice A).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent c4OK:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 2en9:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the factor by which Star_1&#39;s luminosity is greater than Star_2&#39;s and select the closest multiple-choice option.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
