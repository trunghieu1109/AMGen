We express each fragment’s total energy Ei=γi\u2009mic2 and momentum pi=γi\u2009mi\u2009vi, relate them via Ei2−(pic)2=mi2\u2009c4, enforce p1=−p2, and E1+E2=Mc2.; answer: Let M\u2009c2=300\u2009GeV, m1=0.66\u2009M (→m1c2=198\u2009GeV), m2=0.33\u2009M (→m2c2=99\u2009GeV). Define common |p| and energies E1,E2: 1) Energy conservation: E1+E2=Mc2=300\u2009GeV. 2) Momentum conservation: p1+p2=0 ⇒ p1=−p2 with |p1|=|p2|=p. 3) Relativistic dispersion for each fragment: E1=√(p2c2+m1^2c4), E2=√(p2c2+m2^2c4). 4) Kinetic energies: T1=E1−m1c2, T2=E2−m2c2.
