    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;20 MeV.&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compute the difference between the relativistically correct kinetic energy T1 (from Sub-task 4) and the classical approximation T1 (from Sub-task 5), to determine the relativistic correction magnitude. Debate pattern is used to ensure correctness and consensus on the difference value. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent j0E9:
We subtract the classical T1 (1.000 GeV) from the relativistic T1 (1.005 GeV), giving ΔT=0.005 GeV, i.e. 5 MeV.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent pi7J:
The relativistic T1≈1.005 GeV and classical T1≈1.000 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Wup8:
Relativistic T1 ≈1.005 GeV, classical T1 ≈1.000 GeV, difference ≈0.005 GeV = 5 MeV, which matches choice B).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IgPS:
The relativistic calculation gave T1≈1.005 GeV (1005 MeV) while the nonrelativistic gave T1≈1.000 GeV (1000 MeV). Their difference is 5 MeV.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent j0E9:
5 MeV

### answer #1 by Debate Agent pi7J:
5 MeV

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Wup8:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent IgPS:
5 MeV

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energies.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
