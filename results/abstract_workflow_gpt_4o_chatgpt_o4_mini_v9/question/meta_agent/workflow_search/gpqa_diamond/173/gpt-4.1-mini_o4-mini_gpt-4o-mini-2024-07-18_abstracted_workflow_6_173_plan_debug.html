    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;20 MeV.&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Based on the computed difference in kinetic energies, compare it with the provided multiple-choice options (10 MeV, 5 MeV, 2 MeV, 20 MeV) and identify the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 2EuY:
The relativistic minus classical kinetic energy difference was calculated as 5 MeV, which matches option B).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent rYtl:
Difference computed is 5 MeV, matching choice B).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1ZR3:
The computed difference ΔT is 5 MeV, which matches the second option (choice2). In alphabetical terms: A) 10 MeV, B) 5 MeV, C) 2 MeV, D) 20 MeV. Thus the correct answer is B).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent D0Mc:
From the relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations, the difference ΔT = 5 MeV. Among the given options, 5 MeV corresponds to choice 2, which is option B.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 2EuY:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent rYtl:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 1ZR3:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent D0Mc:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the correct multiple-choice answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
