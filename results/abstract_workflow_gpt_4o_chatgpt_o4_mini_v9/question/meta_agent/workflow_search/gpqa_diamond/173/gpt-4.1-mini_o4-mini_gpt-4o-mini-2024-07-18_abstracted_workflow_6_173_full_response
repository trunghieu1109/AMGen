In rest‐mass energy units (300\u2009GeV total): m\u2009c²=0.33×300\u2009GeV=99\u2009GeV, 2m\u2009c²=198\u2009GeV.; answer: Lighter fragment rest mass m=0.99M/3=0.33\u2009M (rest‐mass energy 99\u2009GeV), heavier fragment rest mass 2m=0.66\u2009M (rest‐mass energy 198\u2009GeV).\nCoT-SC agent LfA3, expressing fragment masses, thinking: We denote the lighter fragment rest mass as m and the heavier as 2m. The sum of their rest masses is given as m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. Solving for m gives m = 0.99 M/3 = 0.33 M. The heavier fragment then has rest mass 2m = 0.66 M.; answer: Lighter fragment rest mass = 0.33 M; Heavier fragment rest mass = 0.66 M\nCoT-SC agent orko, expressing fragment masses, thinking: We have m + 2m = 0.99 M ⇒ 3m = 0.99 M ⇒ m = 0.33 M. Therefore the lighter fragment has rest mass m = 0.33 M, and the heavier fragment has rest mass 2m = 0.66 M.; answer: Lighter fragment rest mass = 0.33 M; Heavier fragment rest mass = 0.66 M\nCoT agent vkg5, calculating relativistic kinetic energy T1, thinking: We have m1 = 0.66\u2009M and m2 = 0.33\u2009M, initial rest energy E0 = M\u2009c^2 = 300\u2009GeV, so Q = (M−m1−m2)c^2 = 0.01\u2009M\u2009c^2 = 3\u2009GeV. From conservation of energy: T1+T2 = Q, and from momentum equality p1=p2 ⇒ T1(T1+2m1c^2)=T2(T2+2m2c^2). Setting T2 = Q−T1 and solving gives T1 = Q(Q+2m2c^2)/(2[(m1+m2)c^2+Q]) = Q(Q+2m2c^2)/(2M\u2009c^2). Plug in m2c^2=99\u2009GeV and Q=3\u2009GeV: T1 = 3*(3+198)/(600)\u2009GeV = 1.005\u2009GeV.; answer: T1 = [Q(Q+2m2c^2)]/(2\u2009M\u2009c^2), numerically T1 ≈ 1.005\u2009GeV\nCoT agent 92Rq, calculating classical kinetic energy T1_classical, thinking: We know m_light = 0.33 M, m_heavy = 0.66 M, and the available energy is ΔE = 0.01 M c^2. In classical mechanics, momentum conservation gives m_heavy v_heavy = m_light v_light ⇒ v_light = 2 v_heavy. Total KE = ½ m_heavy v_heavy^2 + ½ m_light (2 v_heavy)^2 = M v_heavy^2 = 0.01 M c^2, so v_heavy^2 = 0.01 c^2. Then T1_classical = ½ m_heavy v_heavy^2 = 0.5·0.66 M·0.01 c^2 = 0.0033 M c^2. With M c^2 = 300 GeV, T1_classical ≈ 0.0033·300 GeV = 0.99 GeV ≃ 990 MeV.; answer: T1_classical ≈ 990 MeV\nReflexion CoT agent nIPr, computing difference in kinetic energies, thinking: We have the relativistic kinetic energy T1 ≃ 1.005 GeV and the classical approximation T1_classical ≃ 0.990 GeV. Their difference is ΔT = T1 – T1_classical ≃ 1.005 GeV – 0.990 GeV = 0.015 GeV = 15 MeV.; answer: 15 MeV.\nCritic agent oTtG, providing feedback, thinking: The difference calculation is incorrect. The classical approximation gives T1_classical ≃ 1\u2009GeV (not 0.99\u2009GeV), while the relativistic result is ≃1.005\u2009GeV, so ΔT ≃0.005\u2009GeV=5\u2009MeV, not 15\u2009MeV.; answer: 5 MeV.\nReflexion CoT agent nIPr, refining difference calculation, thinking: We recompute: initial mass M splits into m1=0.66M and m2=0.33M with energy release Q=0.01Mc²=3 GeV. Relativistic T1 = Q(Q+2m2c²)/(2Mc²) = 3 (3+198)/600 = 1.005 GeV. Classical T1 = ½m1v1² with total KE Q and m1v1=m2v2 gives T1_classical = 0.003333Mc² = 1.0 GeV.
