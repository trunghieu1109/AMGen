Using λ_obs = (1+z)λ_emit, z ≈ (790/121.6)–1 ≈ 5.5–6.5, which is typical for high-z quasars. Thus the intrinsic feature is Lyman-α at 121.6 nm.; answer: 121.6 nm (Lyman-α)\nCoT agent y3ro, calculating redshift z, thinking: We apply the relation z = λ_obs/λ_emit - 1 with λ_obs = 790 nm and λ_emit = 121.6 nm: z = 790/121.6 - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 ≈ 5.497, so about 5.5.; answer: The redshift is approximately z ≈ 5.5.\nReflexion CoT agent 6RA3, calculating comoving distance, thinking: We estimate z≈5.5 from λobs/λemit−1. The comoving distance D_C=c/H0∫0^z dz'/√(Ωm(1+z')^3+ΩΛ). Numerically, c/H0≈4282 Mpc and ∫0^5.5 dz'/E(z')≈1.91, giving D_C≈4282×1.91≈8180 Mpc≈8.2 Gpc, so closest choice is 8 Gpc.; answer: A)\nCritic agent 7JsO, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation is essentially correct and sufficiently complete for the multiple-choice context. With z≈5.5 one has c/H₀≈4282 Mpc and ∫₀^{5.5}dz′/√(Ωₘ(1+z′)³+Ω_Λ)≈1.91, giving D_C≈4282×1.91≈8180 Mpc (≈8.2 Gpc). Rounding to the offered choices yields 8 Gpc. One could refine the numerical integral (or include a small radiation term), but for ΛCDM at z≈5.5 this approximation is appropriate.; answer: The calculation is correct; the comoving distance is ≈8 Gpc.\nReflexion CoT agent 6RA3, refining comoving distance, thinking: We take z ≈ 5.5 from Sub-task 1. The comoving distance D_C = (c/H0) ∫0^z dz'/√(Ωm(1+z')^3+ΩΛ). With c/H0 ≈ 300\u2009000\u2009km/s ÷ 70\u2009km/s/Mpc ≈ 4286\u2009Mpc and numerical integral ∫0^5.5 dz'/E(z') ≈ 1.91, we get D_C ≈ 4286×1.91 ≈ 8180\u2009Mpc ≈ 8.18\u2009Gpc.
