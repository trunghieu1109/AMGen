{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths &lt; 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;8 Gpc&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;9 Gpc&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;7 Gpc&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;6 Gpc&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated comoving distance from Sub-task 3 with the given multiple-choice options (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 9 Gpc) and select the closest value as the assumed comoving distance of the quasar from Earth at scale factor a=1. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent yd6Z:
From Sub-task 3 we found D_C ≈ 8.18 Gpc, so the closest among the options (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc) is 8 Gpc.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 8YMB:
The calculated comoving distance is ≈8.18 Gpc from Sub-task 3, which is closest to the 8 Gpc option.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Bfjq:
The computed comoving distance is approximately 8.18 Gpc, which is closest to the 8 Gpc choice.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent x8nj:
The calculated comoving distance is ≈8.18 Gpc, which is closest to the 8 Gpc option.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent yd6Z:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 8YMB:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Bfjq:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the closest comoving distance choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
