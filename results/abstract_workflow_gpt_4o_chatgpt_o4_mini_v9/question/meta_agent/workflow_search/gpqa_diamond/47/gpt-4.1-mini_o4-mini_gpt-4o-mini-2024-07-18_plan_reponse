        "response": "Product 4 is cyclohexane-1-carboxaldehyde. The aldehyde proton is unique. The ring carbons C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4 each have nonequivalent axial and equatorial hydrogens due to the formyl substituent breaking symmetry. Thus there are 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (C2/C6 axial/equatorial) + 2 (C3/C5 axial/equatorial) + 2 (C4 axial/equatorial) = 7 distinct hydrogen types.\n\nAnswer:C)",
