Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_47
proposed answer: Product 4 is cyclohexane-1-carboxaldehyde. The aldehyde proton is unique. The ring carbons C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4 each have nonequivalent axial and equatorial hydrogens due to the formyl substituent breaking symmetry. Thus there are 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (C2/C6 axial/equatorial) + 2 (C3/C5 axial/equatorial) + 2 (C4 axial/equatorial) = 7 distinct hydrogen types.

proposed answer: Product 4 is cyclopentane-1-carbaldehyde. The aldehyde proton is one environment; the ring CH at C1 is a second. The CH2 groups at C2/C5 are equivalent by a 180° rotation and each pair’s two protons are diastereotopic, giving two more distinct environments. Likewise C3/C4 give two more. Total = 1 (CHO) + 1 (C1–H) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct hydrogens.
