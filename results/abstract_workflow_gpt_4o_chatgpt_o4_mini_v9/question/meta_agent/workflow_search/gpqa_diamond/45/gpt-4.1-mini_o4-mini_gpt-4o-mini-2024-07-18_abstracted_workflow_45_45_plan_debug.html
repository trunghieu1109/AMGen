### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on unique product identification. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Twxw:
The self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene gives a single carbon skeleton (3,6-dimethylhept-3-ene). The double bond can adopt E or Z geometry (2). Each geometry contains two equivalent chiral R-groups from the starting material, which due to molecular symmetry yield a meso form plus an enantiomeric pair (3 stereoisomers per geometry). Thus in total there are 2×3=6 distinct products.

### answer by Final Decision Agent Twxw:
6 unique products: for both E and Z isomers of 3,6-dimethylhept-3-ene, each exists as one meso form and one enantiomeric pair (total 6).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Count the number of unique possible products formed from the reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst (excluding ethene), to answer the original question and select the correct choice from the given options.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
