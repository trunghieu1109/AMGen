{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;6&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the product enumeration from Sub-task 4, evaluate and count the distinct possible products formed from the metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, ensuring no duplicates and excluding ethene, to determine the total number of unique products. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent etU8:
Based on the enumeration from Sub-task 4, there are 2 monomer products (R and S 3-methylpent-1-ene) and 6 stereoisomeric dimers (E/Z variants of RR, SS, and meso RS), totaling 8 unique products.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent CBiQ:
Sub‐task 4 listed 8 distinct products (2 enantiomers from cross‐metathesis and 6 stereoisomers from self‐metathesis dimers). There are no duplicates and ethene is excluded.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent etU8:
8

### answer #1 by Debate Agent CBiQ:
8

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the total number of unique products excluding ethene.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
