Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_45
proposed answer: Based on the enumeration: 2 enantiomeric monomers (R and S) and 6 stereoisomeric dimers (E/Z variants of RR, SS, and RS meso), totaling 8 unique products.

Answer:C)

Correct answer: 1
Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_45_45
proposed answer: Self‐metathesis of racemic 3‐methylpent‐1‐ene gives one carbon skeleton (3,6‐dimethylhept‐3‐ene) with E and Z double‐bond isomers (2). Each isomer has a meso form and an enantiomeric pair due to two identical stereocenters, giving 3 stereoisomers per geometry. Total = 2 × 3 = 6.
