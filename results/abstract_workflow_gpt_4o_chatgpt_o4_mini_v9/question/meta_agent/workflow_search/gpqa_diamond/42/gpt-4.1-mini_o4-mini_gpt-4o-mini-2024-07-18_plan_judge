Question: Example(question='A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', choice1='5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice2='3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice3='2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', choice4='2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_42
proposed answer: Both analyses derived the IUPAC name as 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which corresponds exactly to choice 2.

proposed answer: Numbering the ring with COOH as C-1 gives substituents at C-2 N,N-dimethylamino, C-3 formyl, C-4 methoxy, C-5 cyano and C-6 hydroxy. Alphabetizing substituents (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) yields the name “5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid,” which corresponds to choice 1.
