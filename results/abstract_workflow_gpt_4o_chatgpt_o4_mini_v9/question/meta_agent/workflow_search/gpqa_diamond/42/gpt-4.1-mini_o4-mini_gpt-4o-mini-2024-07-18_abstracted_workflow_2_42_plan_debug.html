    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid&#39;}.
