Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_120
proposed answer: The predicted product from Sub-task 7 is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Comparing to the options, only choice 3 matches this exact substitution pattern and stereochemistry, making it the correct product.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_26_120
proposed answer: Based on inversion at the less hindered carbon and matching the predicted stereochemistry from Sub-task 5, the product corresponds to (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which is choice C.
