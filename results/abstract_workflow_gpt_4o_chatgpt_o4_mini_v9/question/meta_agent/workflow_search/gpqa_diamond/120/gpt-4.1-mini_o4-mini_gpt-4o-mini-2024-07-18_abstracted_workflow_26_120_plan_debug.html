{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compare the predicted product structure and stereochemistry from Sub-task 5 with the four given choices to identify which matches the predicted product. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent HzCB:
The predicted product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds exactly to choice3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent y9QM:
The predicted product from Sub-task 5 is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Among the choices, option C corresponds exactly to this stereochemistry and substituent pattern.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 2usB:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Prioritize and select the correct product choice based on stereochemical consistency and structural features.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
