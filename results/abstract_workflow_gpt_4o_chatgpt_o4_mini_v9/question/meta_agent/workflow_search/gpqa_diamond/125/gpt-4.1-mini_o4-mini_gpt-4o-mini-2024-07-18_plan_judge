Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_125
proposed answer: The integrated predictions give 5 peaks on the chiral column and 4 peaks on the normal‚Äêphase column, which corresponds to choice 2.

proposed answer: Reaction I yields two diastereomers (3R,5S and 3S,5S); Reaction II yields three stereoisomers (a meso form and an enantiomeric pair). On a chiral HPLC column all enantiomers and diastereomers are separated, so you observe one peak per stereoisomer: 2 + 3 = 5 peaks.

Answer:5 peaks
