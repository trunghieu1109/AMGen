The strong base (n-BuLi) induced rearrangement of an allylic ether to give a homoallylic alcohol is the classic [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement.; answer: A: Pinacol rearrangement\nB: [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement\nCoT-SC agent NdVe, extracting product features, thinking: We need to classify the key structural motifs in each product and connect them to their likely precursors in the named reactions. The first product is a spirocyclic ketone arising from an acid‐promoted pinacol rearrangement of a vicinal diol. The second is a homoallylic alcohol formed via a [2,3]‐Wittig rearrangement of an allylic ether.; answer: Product 1: 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one contains a spirocyclic bicyclic system (a five- and six-membered ring sharing one carbon), methyl groups at C2 and C8, and a ketone at C6. It implies a vicinal diol precursor (pinacol) such as 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol which rearranges under H2SO4 to give the spiro ketone.\n\nProduct 2: 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol features a secondary allylic alcohol (–CH–OH adjacent to a C=C), a phenyl substituent at C1, an alkene between C3 and C4, and a methyl at C4. It points to an allylic aryl ether precursor (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, which under BuLi and H+ undergoes a [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement to yield the homoallylic alcohol.\nCoT-SC agent arVZ, extracting product features, thinking: The products’ structures indicate the functional groups and ring motifs that directly point back to their likely precursors. The spiro ketone arises from a vicinal diol (pinacol) rearrangement, while the homoallylic alcohol with phenyl substituent and internal alkene is characteristic of a [2,3]-Wittig shift from an allylic ether.; answer: A (2,8-Dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one):\n• Spiro bicyclic scaffold: a cyclohexane and a cyclopentane sharing one quaternary (“spiro”) carbon.\n• Ketone (C=O) at the bridgehead-adjacent carbon (position 6).\n• Two methyl substituents at positions 2 and 8.\n\nB (4-Methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol):\n• Primary alcohol (–CH2OH) at C1 bearing the phenyl ring.\n• Internal alkene (C3=C4) giving an allylic relationship to the OH.\n• Phenyl substituent on C1 and a methyl substituent on C4.\n• Overall a homoallylic alcohol (typical [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement product).\nCoT-SC agent F6hu, extracting product features, thinking: We examine the two product structures to identify ring systems and functional groups, then infer what type of precursors would give those motifs under pinacol and [2,3]-Wittig conditions.; answer: 2,8-Dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one:\n• Spirocyclic bicyclic framework (cyclopentane and cyclohexane sharing one carbon).\n• Key functional group: ketone at the spiro center.\n• Two methyl substituents at positions 2 and 8 adjacent to the spiro carbon.\nThese features point back to a vicinal diol on the same spiro scaffold (pinacol rearrangement precursor).\n\n4-Methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol:\n• Allylic secondary alcohol (OH at C1) with an internal alkene between C3 and C4.\n• Phenyl substituent at C1 and a methyl at C4.\nThese motifs are characteristic of a benzyl allylic ether undergoing a [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement.\nCoT agent nIex, evaluating reactant choices, thinking: To perform a pinacol rearrangement under H₂SO₄, the reactant A must be a vicinal diol.
