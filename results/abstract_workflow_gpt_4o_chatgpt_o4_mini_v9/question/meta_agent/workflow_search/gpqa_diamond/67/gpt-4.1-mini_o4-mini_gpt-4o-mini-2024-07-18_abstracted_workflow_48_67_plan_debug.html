    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;gamma*B/2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;gamma*B&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;gamma*B/sqrt(2)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;sqrt(2)*gamma*B&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compare the derived oscillation frequency with the given multiple-choice options: gamma*B/2, gamma*B, gamma*B/sqrt(2), sqrt(2)*gamma*B, and select the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent rLTc:
The derived oscillation frequency is ω=γB, which matches choice B.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent UyOy:
The time-dependent expression for ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ oscillates as cos(γBt), so the angular frequency ω = γB, which matches choice 2.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent rLTc:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent UyOy:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the correct oscillation frequency.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
