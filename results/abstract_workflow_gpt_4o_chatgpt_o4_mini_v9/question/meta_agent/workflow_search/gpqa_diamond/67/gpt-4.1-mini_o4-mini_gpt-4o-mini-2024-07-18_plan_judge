Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_67
proposed answer: From the time-dependent expression μ_z(t)=γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt), the angular frequency of oscillation is ω=γB, which directly matches choice B).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_48_67
proposed answer: In a magnetic field along +Y of magnitude B, the spin-1/2 particle’s ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ oscillates as cos(γBt), giving angular frequency ω = γB, which matches choice B.
