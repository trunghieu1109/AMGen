This is straightforward quantum spin description.; answer: Initial condition: The spin-½ particle is prepared in the Sz=+ħ/2 eigenstate, so its magnetic moment μ=γSz points along +z under the original field B⃗ =B\u2009ẑ. At t=0 the +z field is switched off and an equal‐magnitude field B⃗ =B\u2009ŷ is turned on, so the Hamiltonian instantly changes from −γB\u2009Sz to −γB\u2009Sy.\nCoT-SC agent MQoe, recalling Hamiltonian, thinking: The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a field B is H=−μ⋅B, with μ=γS. After the switch, B=Bŷ so H=−γS⋅B=−γB\u2009Sy. In Pauli-matrix form Sy=(ħ/2)σy, giving H=−(γħB/2)σy.; answer: H=−μ⋅B=−γS⋅B; for B=B\u2009ŷ, H=−γB\u2009Sy=−(γħB/2)σy\nCoT-SC agent oAOS, recalling Hamiltonian, thinking: The Hamiltonian for a spin-½ in a magnetic field is H=−μ·B=−γS·B. From sub‐task 1, the new field is B along +ŷ, so we substitute B→By=\u2009B and S→Sy.; answer: H=−γS·B=−γB\u2009Sy. In the {Sz} basis, Sy=(ħ/2)σy, so H=−(γBħ/2)σy.\nCoT-SC agent sZNn, recalling Hamiltonian, thinking: The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is H=−μ·B. Here μ=γS and after t=0 the field is B⃗ =Bŷ, so H=−γS·(Bŷ)=−γBSy.; answer: The Hamiltonian is H=−μ·B=−γ\u2009S·B=−γ\u2009B\u2009S_y.\nCoT agent 2CAF, determining time evolution, thinking: Given H=−(γħB/2)σ_y, the propagator is U(t)=exp(−iHt/ħ)=exp[i(γB/2)σ_y t], which generates rotations about y at ω=γB. No missing info.; answer: U(t)=exp(−iHt/ħ)=exp[i(γB t/2)σ_y]=cos(γB t/2)I+ i sin(γB t/2)σ_y. For initial |+z⟩: |ψ(t)⟩=cos(γB t/2)|+z⟩−sin(γB t/2)|−z⟩.\nCoT-SC agent F5Io, calculating expectation value, thinking: We use the time‐evolved state |ψ(t)>=cos(γBt/2)|+z>−sin(γBt/2)|−z>. Then ⟨σ_z⟩=cos^2(γBt/2)−sin^2(γBt/2)=cos(γBt). Hence ⟨S_z⟩=(ħ/2)cos(γBt) and ⟨μ_z⟩=γ⟨S_z⟩=(γħ/2)cos(γBt).; answer: μ_z(t) = (γħ/2) cos(γ B t)\nCoT-SC agent QIIo, calculating expectation value, thinking: We use the time‐evolved state |ψ(t)⟩=cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩−sin(γBt/2)|−z⟩, compute 〈S_z〉=(ħ/2)(cos²(γBt/2)−sin²(γBt/2))=(ħ/2)cos(γBt), then 〈μ_z〉=γ〈S_z〉=(γħ/2)cos(γBt).; answer: Sub-task 4: <mu_z>(t) = (γħ/2) cos(γB t).\nCoT-SC agent na8U, calculating expectation value, thinking: Using the state |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ − sin(γBt/2)|−z⟩ and μ_z = γS_z with S_z eigenvalues ±ħ/2, we get ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ(ħ/2)[cos^2(γBt/2) − sin^2(γBt/2)] = (γħ/2) cos(γBt).; answer: <μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) cos(γB t)\nCoT agent mw4w, identifying oscillation frequency, thinking: The time‐dependent expectation μ_z(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt) oscillates with argument γBt, so the angular frequency is ω=γB. Among the choices, this corresponds to γB.; answer: B)\nDebate agent rLTc, round 0, debating frequency comparison, thinking: The derived oscillation frequency is ω=γB, which matches choice B.; answer: B)\nDebate agent UyOy, round 0, debating frequency comparison, thinking: The time-dependent expression for ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ oscillates as cos(γBt), so the angular frequency ω = γB, which matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nFinal Decision agent, deciding correct frequency, thinking: In a magnetic field along +Y of magnitude B, the spin-1/2 particle’s ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ oscillates as cos(γBt), giving angular frequency ω = γB, which matches choice B.; answer: B)', iteration_idx=-1)]
