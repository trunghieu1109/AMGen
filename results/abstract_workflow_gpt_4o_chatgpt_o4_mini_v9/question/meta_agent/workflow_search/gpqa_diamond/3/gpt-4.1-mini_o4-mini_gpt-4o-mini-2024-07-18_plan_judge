Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_3
proposed answer: Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero divergence of B (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and add a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law (curl of E), while Ampère–Maxwell’s law remains unchanged. This matches choice 3.

proposed answer: We need to match the two equations that change—Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday’s law (curl of E)—to the given choices. “Circulation of the electric field” means curl E, and “divergence of the magnetic field” is Gauss’s law for magnetism. That corresponds exactly to choice 3.
