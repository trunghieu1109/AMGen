    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the evaluated changes in Maxwell&#39;s equations with the provided multiple-choice options to identify which choice correctly describes the equations that differ in the parallel universe scenario with magnetic monopoles. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mqRp:
The presence of magnetic monopoles adds a source term to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) and a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law (∇×E changes), while Ampère–Maxwell’s law (curl of B) remains unchanged. Thus the modified equations are divergence of B and circulation of E, matching choice 3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent q69j:
Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero divergence of B (Gauss’s law) and an extra term in Faraday’s law (curl of E), while the curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell) is unchanged.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent mqRp:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent q69j:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on which multiple-choice option correctly describes the Maxwell&#39;s equations differences due to magnetic monopoles.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
