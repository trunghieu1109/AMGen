I will list those equations clearly as the baseline before modifications in the parallel-universe scenario.; answer: Standard Maxwell’s equations (in vacuum) focusing on the magnetic field and electric field circulation:\n\n1) Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B):\n   ∇·B = 0\n   (implies no isolated magnetic monopoles in classical electromagnetism)\n\n2) Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B):\n   ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n   (relates magnetic field circulation to electric currents J and changing electric field)\n\n3) Faraday’s law of induction (curl of E, i.e., circulation of E):\n   ∇×E = -∂B/∂t\n   (a changing magnetic field induces an electric field)\n\nThese three equations, together with Gauss’s law for electricity (∇·E = ρ/ε₀), form the complete set of Maxwell’s equations in classical electromagnetism. In particular, the ones involving the magnetic field are (1) and (2), and the equation for the electric field circulation is (3).\nCoT agent P6jc, understanding magnetic monopoles, thinking: In classical electromagnetism magnetic monopoles don’t exist so ∇·B=0 and no magnetic current appears in Faraday’s law. Introducing isolated north or south poles means there is a nonzero magnetic charge density ρₘ and possibly magnetic current Jₘ when monopoles move. This directly modifies the zero‐divergence assumption and demands extra source terms in the induction law.; answer: In a universe with magnetic monopoles: 1) Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρₘ (instead of 0), where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density. 2) Faraday’s law acquires a magnetic current term: ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – Jₘ, where Jₘ is the magnetic current density. Thus the key assumption ∇·B=0 is replaced, and induction includes magnetic charges in motion.\nCoT agent qfjM, analyzing divergence modification, thinking: Sub-task 3 asks how introducing magnetic monopoles changes Gauss’s law for magnetism. From Sub-task 1, the standard equation is ∇·B = 0. From Sub-task 2, the presence of a magnetic charge density ρₘ yields a nonzero divergence and hence a source term. In SI units this becomes ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρₘ.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism is modified from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρₘ, where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density.\nCoT agent lZHv, analyzing curl modification, thinking: We need to compare the standard curl‐equations (from Sub-task 1) with their monopole‐modified forms (from Sub-task 2). Standard: ∇×E=−∂B/∂t, ∇×B=μ₀Jₑ+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t. Introducing moving magnetic charges adds a magnetic current density Jₘ that acts as an extra source in Faraday’s law, but does not alter Ampère–Maxwell’s law for ∇×B.; answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles:  \n1) Faraday’s law (circulation of E) becomes  ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – Jₘ  (new source term from magnetic currents).  \n2) Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B) remains  ∇×B = μ₀\u2009Jₑ + μ₀ε₀\u2009∂E/∂t  (unchanged by monopoles).  \nThus monopoles modify only the curl‐E equation by adding –Jₘ; the curl‐B equation is unchanged.\nDebate agent QiLW, round 0, comparing equations, thinking: To determine which equations change, compare standard Maxwell’s equations with the monopole-augmented forms: 1) Gauss’s law for magnetism is modified from ∇·B=0 to ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ. 2) Faraday’s law is modified from ∇×E=–∂B/∂t to ∇×E=–∂B/∂t – Jₘ. The Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B) and Gauss’s law for electricity (∇·E) remain unchanged. Hence only the divergence of B and the curl of E differ.; answer: The modified equations that differ are Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (∇×E).\nDebate agent zKpt, round 0, comparing equations, thinking: The only Maxwell equations that acquire new source terms when magnetic monopoles and currents are included are Gauss’s law for magnetism (which goes from ∇·B=0 to ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ) and Faraday’s law (which goes from ∇×E=−∂B/∂t to ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−Jₘ). Ampère–Maxwell’s law and Gauss’s law for electricity remain unchanged.; answer: The divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and the circulation of the electric field (Faraday’s law) differ; the other two Maxwell equations remain the same.\nDebate agent YEBh, round 0, comparing equations, thinking: To identify which Maxwell equations change in the presence of magnetic monopoles, we compare the four standard equations with their monopole‐modified forms: 1) Gauss’s law for electricity (∇·E=ρₑ/ε₀) is unchanged since electric charges are still conserved. 2) Gauss’s law for magnetism changes from ∇·B=0 to ∇·B=μ₀\u2009ρₘ because magnetic charges act as sources of B. 3) Faraday’s law (∇×E=–∂B/∂t) gains a magnetic current term, becoming ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ. 4) The Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B=μ₀\u2009Jₑ+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) remains unchanged as magnetic monopoles do not contribute to the electric current term. Thus only the divergence of B and the curl of E differ.; answer: The modified Maxwell equations differ only in:\n1) Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B): from ∇·B=0 to ∇·B=μ₀\u2009ρₘ.\n2) Faraday’s law (curl of E): from ∇×E=–∂B/∂t to ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ.\nAll other Maxwell equations remain the same.\nDebate agent xGoY, round 0, comparing equations, thinking: Sub-task 5 simply asks which Maxwell equations change when monopoles exist. From Sub-task 3 the divergence law for B picks up μ₀ρₘ; from Sub-task 4 Faraday’s law picks up –Jₘ. The other two (Gauss for E and Ampère–Maxwell) stay the same. Thus the only modifications are to Gauss’s law for magnetism and to the circulation law for E.; answer: The modified Maxwell’s equations differ only in:\n1) Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B): ∇·B=μ₀\u2009ρₘ instead of 0\n2) Faraday’s law (curl of E): ∇×E=–∂B/∂t – Jₘ instead of ∇×E=–∂B/∂t\nAll other Maxwell equations remain unchanged.\nFinal Decision agent, deciding differing equations, thinking: Comparing the standard Maxwell equations with their monopole‐augmented forms shows only two acquire new source terms: Gauss’s law for magnetism changes from ∇·B=0 to ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ, and Faraday’s law changes from ∇×E=–∂B/∂t to ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ.
