Gauss's law for magnetism (∇·B=0) becomes ∇·B=ρ_m. Faraday's law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t) gains a magnetic current term: ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−μ₀J_m. The other two Maxwell equations remain unchanged.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) changes to ∇·B=ρ_m, and Faraday’s law (circulation of E) changes to ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−μ₀J_m. These are the only equations modified by magnetic monopoles.\nCoT-SC agent zrGJ, classifying magnetic monopoles' role, thinking: Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density ρ_m and a corresponding magnetic current density J_m. These enter the divergence and curl equations for the magnetic and electric fields, respectively, while leaving the other Maxwell equations unchanged.; answer: With magnetic monopoles present:\n1) Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) becomes ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.\n2) Faraday’s law (curl/circulation of E) becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density.\nThe other two equations (Gauss’s law for E and the Ampère–Maxwell law) remain unmodified.\nCoT-SC agent MGzN, classifying magnetic monopoles' role, thinking: To include magnetic monopoles, the divergence‐free law for B must allow a nonzero magnetic charge density, and Faraday’s law must include a magnetic current term to preserve charge conservation. These are the only Maxwell equations directly involving “sources” of B or its time variation through currents.; answer: With magnetic monopoles the modified Maxwell equations become (SI units):\n1) Gauss’s law for magnetism: ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ  (instead of ∇·B = 0)\n2) Faraday’s law (with magnetic current): ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ Jₘ\nThe other two (Gauss’s electric law and Ampère–Maxwell law) remain unchanged. These modifications account for magnetic charge density ρₘ and magnetic current density Jₘ.\nReflexion CoT agent bTcQ, evaluating changes due to magnetic monopoles, thinking: Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a nonzero magnetic charge density ρ_m to Gauss’s law for magnetism and a magnetic current density J_m to Faraday’s law, but leaves Ampère’s law (curl of B) unchanged.; answer: The divergence equation becomes ∇·B = ρ_m; the curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell law) remains unchanged; the circulation of E (Faraday’s law) is modified to ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – μ₀J_m.\nCritic agent KWrQ, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that Gauss’s law for magnetism now reads ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ and that Faraday’s law is modified to ∇×E = −∂B/∂t − μ₀ Jₘ, while Ampère–Maxwell’s law (curl of B) remains unchanged. However, it omitted the μ₀ factor in the divergence equation, making the unit conventions inconsistent.; answer: The divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and the circulation of the electric field (Faraday’s law) change; the curl of the magnetic field (Ampère–Maxwell law) remains unchanged.\nReflexion CoT agent bTcQ, refining evaluation, thinking: Introducing magnetic monopoles requires adding a magnetic charge density ρₘ to Gauss’s law for magnetism and a magnetic current density Jₘ to Faraday’s law, but leaves Ampère–Maxwell’s law (curl of B) unchanged. Critic correctly noted the missing μ₀ factor in the divergence equation.; answer: With magnetic monopoles present:\n• Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ (instead of zero).\n• Faraday’s law (circulation of E) becomes ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – μ₀ Jₘ.\n• Ampère–Maxwell’s law (curl of B) remains unchanged.\nDebate agent mqRp, round 0, debating correct choice, thinking: The presence of magnetic monopoles adds a source term to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) and a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law (∇×E changes), while Ampère–Maxwell’s law (curl of B) remains unchanged.
