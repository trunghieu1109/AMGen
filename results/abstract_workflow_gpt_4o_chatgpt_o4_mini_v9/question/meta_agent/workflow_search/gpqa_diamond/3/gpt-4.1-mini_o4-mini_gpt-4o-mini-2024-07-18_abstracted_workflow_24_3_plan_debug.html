    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on which Maxwell&#39;s equations differ in the parallel universe scenario. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent YG3W:
Comparing the standard Maxwell equations with their monopole‐augmented forms shows only two acquire new source terms: Gauss’s law for magnetism changes from ∇·B=0 to ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ, and Faraday’s law changes from ∇×E=–∂B/∂t to ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ. The other two equations remain unchanged.

### answer by Final Decision Agent YG3W:
Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday’s law (curl of E).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Map the identified differences in Maxwell&#39;s equations to the provided multiple-choice options, evaluating which choice correctly describes the changes due to magnetic monopoles.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We need to match the two equations that change—Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday’s law (curl of E)—to the given choices. “Circulation of the electric field” means curl E, and “divergence of the magnetic field” is Gauss’s law for magnetism. That corresponds exactly to choice 3.
