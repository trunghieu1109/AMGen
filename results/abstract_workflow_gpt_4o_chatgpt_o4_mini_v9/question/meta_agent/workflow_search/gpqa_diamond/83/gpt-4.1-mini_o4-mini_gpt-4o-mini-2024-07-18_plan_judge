Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_83
proposed answer: From the subtasks, stability analysis and nonlocal boundary conditions ensure correctness but do not generate independent tasks. Complex roots parameterize each subproblem but do not themselves decouple computation. Only the linear partial-fraction decomposition transforms the matrix exponential into a sum of independent shifted linear solves, enabling concurrent execution.

Answer:Linear partial-fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation
Extracted answer: Linear partial-fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_27_83
proposed answer: Only the linear partial-fraction decomposition directly decouples the rational approximation of the matrix exponential into independent shifted solves, enabling concurrent computation and thus the conversion from a sequential to a parallel algorithm. Other factors like stability analysis, complex roots, or boundary conditions do not themselves create parallel tasks.
