The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Stability analysis&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Complex roots of fractional approximation&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 9: Compare and prioritize the four choices (Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions, Stability analysis, Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation, Complex roots of fractional approximation) based on their evaluated roles and importance in the parallelization of the algorithm, to identify the key factor that enables conversion from sequential to parallel algorithm. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent HTBV:
Based on the sub‐task analyses, only the linear partial fraction decomposition directly decouples the fractional approximation into independent solves, which is the fundamental enabler of parallelization. Stability analysis ensures correctness but doesn’t create parallel tasks. Complex roots affect implementation details but not the decomposition itself. Nonlocal boundary conditions are largely orthogonal to this parallel‐splitting mechanism.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent vkco:
In preceding subtasks we saw that nonlocal boundary conditions do not drive decomposition and complex roots are an implementation detail, while stability analysis ensures correctness but does not create parallel tasks. The partial‐fraction decomposition, however, rewrites the rational approximation of the matrix exponential as a sum of independent shifted solves, each of which can be computed concurrently. Thus this is the key enabler of converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent V1Su:
Based on the sub-task analyses, only the linear partial-fraction decomposition actively creates independent, parallel tasks by splitting the rational approximation into separate shifted solves. Stability analysis, complex roots, and nonlocal boundary conditions affect correctness or implementation details but do not themselves enable parallelism.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 0C7V:
Based on the sub‐task analyses, only the linear partial‐fraction decomposition directly decouples the matrix exponential solve into independent subproblems; stability analysis is necessary for correctness but not the enabler of parallelism; complex roots merely affect implementation details; nonlocal boundary conditions play no enabling role. Thus the priority order and key enabler are clear.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent HTBV:
Priority ranking:
1. Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation (Key enabler of parallel splitting)
2. Stability analysis (Ensures numerical correctness but not the driver of parallelism)
3. Complex roots of fractional approximation (Implementation detail regarding complex arithmetic)
4. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (Minimal relevance)

Key factor: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation

### answer #1 by Debate Agent vkco:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent V1Su:
Prioritization of factors in enabling the conversion to a parallel algorithm:
1) Linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation (key enabler)
2) Stability analysis (necessary for correctness but not for task decomposition)
3) Complex roots of the fractional approximation (implementation detail)
4) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (minimal relevance)

Key factor: Linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 0C7V:
Priority ranking:
1. Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation (Choice C) – the fundamental enabler of parallel splitting and conversion to a parallel algorithm.
2. Stability analysis (Choice B) – essential for correctness and convergence but not the mechanism enabling parallel decomposition.
3. Complex roots of fractional approximation (Choice D) – an implementation detail affecting arithmetic but not the driver of parallelism.
4. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (Choice A) – largely irrelevant to enabling parallelism.

Key factor: Choice C) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Make final decision on the key factor enabling parallelization.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
