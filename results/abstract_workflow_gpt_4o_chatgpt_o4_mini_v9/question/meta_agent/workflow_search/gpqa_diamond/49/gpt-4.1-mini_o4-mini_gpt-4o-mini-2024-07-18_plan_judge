Question: Example(question='Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?', choice1='3', choice2='1', choice3='2', choice4='6', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_49
proposed answer: In four-dimensional QFT each loop integral contributes a factor of order 1/(4π)^2. The given size estimate has (1/(4π))^6 = (1/(4π)^2)^3, indicating three loops.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_49
proposed answer: Each loop contributes a factor (1/(4π)^2). Observing (1/(4π)^6) = (1/(4π)^(2L)) gives 2L=6 ⇒ L=3, matching choice1 (3), which is option A).
