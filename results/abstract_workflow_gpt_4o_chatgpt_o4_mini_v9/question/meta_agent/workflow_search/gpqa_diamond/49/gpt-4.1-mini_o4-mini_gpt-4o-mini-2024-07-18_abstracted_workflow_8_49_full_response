This is standard QFT lore and does not require extra data. I will map each symbol to its meaning in a multi‐loop amplitude.; answer: • α³\u2009g²: Each power of a coupling constant comes from a vertex in the Feynman diagram. Here three vertices involve the α‐type interaction and two involve the g‐type, so the diagram has five total interaction points.\n\n• (1/(4π)⁶): In four dimensions each independent loop momentum integral carries a factor of 1/(4π)² after angular integration. Six powers in the denominator imply three loops (since (1/(4π)²)³ = 1/(4π)⁶). This ties the factor directly to the loop order.\n\n• (Q/M)²: This dimensionless ratio compares the characteristic external momentum scale Q to a heavy mass scale M in internal propagators. The quadratic power signifies a leading term in a low‐energy (Q≪M) expansion or a threshold suppression if Q<M.\n\n• √2·8: These are purely numerical symmetry and combinatorial factors arising from Feynman rule conventions (e.g. factors from spinor traces, identical‐line combinatorics, or normalization choices). They do not affect scaling but enter the overall amplitude coefficient.\nCoT agent TjKL, recalled loop order rules, thinking: Loop corrections in perturbative QFT arise from Feynman integrals: each vertex brings in a factor of its coupling constant, and each loop integral in four dimensions contributes roughly a 1/(4π)^2 factor once angular and trivial parts are done.  Thus the overall power of couplings equals the total number of vertices, and the power of 1/(4π) is twice the loop order. No extra data is needed for this general statement.; answer: At L loops in a four-dimensional QFT:  \n• You pick up one factor of the appropriate coupling g at each vertex—so total coupling power ∝ g^{V}, where V is the number of interaction vertices.  \n• Each loop momentum integral ∫d^4k/(2π)^4 yields a factor ∼1/(4π)^2. Hence L loops give (1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^{2L}.  \nPutting it together, an L-loop amplitude scales as g^{V}\u2009·\u20091/(4π)^{2L}, up to external-scale ratios and combinatorial/numerical factors.\nCoT agent wHVj, deduced loop number, thinking: At L loops each loop gives a factor (1/(4π)^2), so (1/(4π)^6) = (1/(4π)^(2L)) ⇒ 2L = 6 ⇒ L = 3 loops.; answer: A)\nDebate agent FKDW, round 0, debating loop number, thinking: Each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4π)^2).
