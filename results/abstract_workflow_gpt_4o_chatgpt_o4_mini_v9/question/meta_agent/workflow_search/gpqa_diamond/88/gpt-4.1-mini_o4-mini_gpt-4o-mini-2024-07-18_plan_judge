Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_88
proposed answer: In the ozonolysis product the most deshielded proton is the aldehyde CH. It is vicinal to two diastereotopic methylene protons on the adamantane cage, each with a slightly different J coupling. This yields a triplet of triplets rather than a simple triplet or pentet.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_39_88
proposed answer: The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton formed after ozonolysis/reductive workup of the alkene. An aldehyde proton typically couples to two adjacent methylene protons with small J values that may differ, giving a doublet of triplets. However, without knowing the exact position of the alkene in product 2 and the diastereotopic environments of those methylene hydrogens, precise coupling constants and partner equivalence remain uncertain.

Answer:A)
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the original alkene position in product 2 to unambiguously determine the vicinal coupling partners and their J values.
