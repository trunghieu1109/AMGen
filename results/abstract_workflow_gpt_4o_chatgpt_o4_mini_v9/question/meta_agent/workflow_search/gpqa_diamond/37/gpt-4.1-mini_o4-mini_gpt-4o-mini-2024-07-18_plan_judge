Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_37
proposed answer: The enamine undergoes deprotonation by LDA in DME, SN2 alkylation with ethyl iodide, then acid hydrolysis to yield the ketone heptan-4-one. This matches choice 4 (D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_20_37
proposed answer: The enamine alkylation sequence involves deprotonation with LDA in DME, alkylation with ethyl iodide, then hydrolysis to yield the α-ethylated ketone, which is 3-ethylpentan-2-one—identical to heptan-4-one. This matches the reagent order and product in choice 4.
