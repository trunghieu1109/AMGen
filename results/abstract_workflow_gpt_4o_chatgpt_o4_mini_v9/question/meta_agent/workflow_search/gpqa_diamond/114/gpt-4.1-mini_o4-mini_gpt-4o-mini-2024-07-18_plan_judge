Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_114
proposed answer: The calculated angle between the photons is 138°, which matches choice3.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_114
proposed answer: From conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-mass frame we found that each photon is emitted at an angle θ ≈ 69.1° to the x-axis, so the angle between their directions is 2θ ≈ 138°, which matches option C.
