Question: Example(question='5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What is the major product?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_145
proposed answer: The endo Diels–Alder addition of maleic anhydride places its substituents cis to the bridged methano group (4R,7S) while the fluorine on the cyclopentadiene remains exo (8r), which directly corresponds to the stereochemistry in choice A.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_145
proposed answer: The Diels–Alder reaction of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene with maleic anhydride is under kinetic control, favoring the endo approach due to secondary orbital interactions. Fluorine’s electron-withdrawing effect slightly stabilizes the transition state but does not override the endo preference. Thus the major stereoisomer has configurations 3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r.
