    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the explicit expression for dN/dr. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 2WPS:
Starting from N(r)∝r^5, differentiate with respect to r to get dN/dr = 5·(constant)·r^4. Thus the number of stars per unit distance interval scales as r^4.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 2WPS:
dN/dr = 5 C r^4, i.e. dN/dr ∝ r^4.

### Sub-task 2: Classify the given choices (~ r^2, ~ r^4, ~ r^3, ~ r^5) as possible functional forms describing how the number of stars varies with distance r, to prepare for comparison with the derived relationship. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent XV7J:
The sub-task asks to list the candidate dependencies of star counts on distance. All four provided forms (~r^2, ~r^3, ~r^4, ~r^5) are valid hypotheses to compare against the derived relationship.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent XV7J:
Possible functional forms for the number of stars versus distance r: ~r^2, ~r^3, ~r^4, ~r^5

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the derived functional form of dN/dr with the given choices (~ r^2, ~ r^4, ~ r^3, ~ r^5) and identify which choice correctly represents the variation of the number of stars with distance.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
