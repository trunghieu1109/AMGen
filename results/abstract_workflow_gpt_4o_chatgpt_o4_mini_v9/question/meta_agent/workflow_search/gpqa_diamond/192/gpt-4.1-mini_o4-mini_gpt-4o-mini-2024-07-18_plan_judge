Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_192
proposed answer: From the derivation, dN/dr ∝ r^4, which matches the choice “~ r^4” (choice2, corresponding to B).

Answer:B)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_192
proposed answer: Starting from N(plx)∝plx⁻⁵ and using plx=1/r, we have dN/dr = N(plx)·|d(plx)/dr| ∝ r⁵·(1/r²)=r³. This matches the ~r³ dependence.
