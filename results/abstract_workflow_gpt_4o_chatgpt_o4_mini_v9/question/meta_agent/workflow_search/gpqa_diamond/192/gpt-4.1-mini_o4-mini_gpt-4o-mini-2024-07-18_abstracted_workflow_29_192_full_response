This inverse relation allows substitution of plx in terms of r so that any function of plx can be rewritten as a function of r. Without establishing plx∝1/r we cannot transform the observed N(plx)∝plx⁻⁵ dependence into an N(r) dependence.; answer: Parallax plx and distance r are related by plx = 1/r (when plx is in arcseconds and r in parsecs). Because plx is inversely proportional to r, any power-law dependence on plx (e.g. N∝plx⁻⁵) can be converted into a dependence on r by substituting plx=1/r.\nCoT-SC agent xxyN, expressing star count in terms of distance, thinking: Substitute plx = 1/r into N ~ 1/plx^5 to get N ~ (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5.; answer: N(r) ∝ r^5\nCoT-SC agent 38CS, expressing star count in terms of distance, thinking: Substitute plx = 1/r into N ∝ plx⁻⁵: N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵.; answer: N(r) ∝ r⁵\nCoT-SC agent 69oD, expressing star count in terms of distance, thinking: We substitute plx=1/r into N∝1/plx^5 to get N∝1/(1/r)^5=r^5.; answer: N(r) ∼ r^5\nReflexion CoT agent Ds21, interpreting star count per unit distance, thinking: We have N(r)∝r^5 from sub-task 2. Interpreting N(r) as the number of stars within a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr, the count per unit distance interval is dN/dr, which shares the same r-dependence. Thus stars per unit r at distance r scale as r^5, with units of stars per parsec (if r in parsecs).; answer: The number of stars per unit distance interval at distance r scales as N(r)∝r^5 (i.e. ~r^5 stars per parsec).\nCritic agent N5AK, feedback on interpretation, thinking: The response incorrectly equates the cumulative count N(r) ∝ r^5 with the differential count per unit distance. In reality, since parallax p=1/r and dp/dr=–1/r², the shell count per unit r is dN/dr = N(p)·|dp/dr| ∝ r^5·(1/r²) ∝ r³. Limitations include the assumed uniform stellar density, neglect of interstellar extinction, magnitude limits, clustering, and selection biases.; answer: ~ r^3\nReflexion CoT agent Ds21, refining interpretation, thinking: To find the number per unit distance we must convert the observed N(plx)∝plx⁻⁵ into a differential count dN/dr. Since plx=1/r, dp/dr=–1/r², the shell count per dr is dN/dr = N(plx)·|dp/dr| ∝ r⁵·(1/r²)=r³. This yields the correct dependence and units.; answer: The number of stars per unit distance interval at distance r scales as dN/dr ∝ r³ (i.e. ∼r³ stars per parsec).\nDebate agent ORQb, round 0, comparing derived form with choices, thinking: We derived that the differential count dN/dr scales as r^3 by substituting parallax p=1/r and dp/dr=–1/r^2 into N(p)∝p^–5, giving dN/dr ∝ r^5·1/r^2 = r^3.
