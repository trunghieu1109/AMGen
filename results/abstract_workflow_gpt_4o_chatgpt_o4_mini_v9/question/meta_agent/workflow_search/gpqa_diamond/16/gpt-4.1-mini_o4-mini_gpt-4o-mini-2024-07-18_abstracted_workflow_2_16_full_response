The reaction is Ca2+ + EDTA4– ⇌ CaEDTA2–, so the association constant is the product over reactants.; answer: For the reaction Ca2+ + EDTA4– ⇌ CaEDTA2–, the equilibrium expression is\nK_Ca-EDTA = [CaEDTA2–] / ([Ca2+]·[EDTA4–])\nCoT agent 25tA, setting equilibrium concentrations, thinking: To set up the equilibrium concentrations, use an ICE table. Start with 0.02 M CaEDTA and negligible free Ca2+ and EDTA4–. Let x = amount dissociated. At equilibrium: [CaEDTA] = 0.02 − x, [Ca2+] = x, [EDTA4–] = x. Substitute into the expression from Sub-task 2.; answer: ICE table:\nInitial: [CaEDTA2–] = 0.02 M, [Ca2+] = 0, [EDTA4–] = 0\nChange: −x       +x      +x\nEquilibrium: [CaEDTA2–] = 0.02 − x, [Ca2+] = x, [EDTA4–] = x\nEquilibrium expression:\nK_Ca-EDTA = [CaEDTA2–] / ([Ca2+]·[EDTA4–]) = (0.02 − x)/(x·x) = 5×10^10\nCoT agent YkWQ, deriving expression for free Ca2+, thinking: Starting from the ICE‐table result: [CaEDTA]=C0−x, [Ca2+]=x, [EDTA]=x. The equilibrium constant K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) = (C0−x)/x^2. Rearranging gives Kx^2 + x − C0 = 0. Solve this quadratic for x = [Ca2+], then simplify for large K.; answer: From K = (C0−x)/x^2 one obtains the quadratic: Kx^2 + x − C0 = 0, whose positive root is x = (−1 + √(1 + 4KC0))⁄(2K). For K ≫ 1, the −1 is negligible and x ≈ √(C0⁄K).\nCoT agent 85KS, calculating numerical free Ca2+ concentration, thinking: Using the derived expression x ≈ √(C0/K), with C0 = 0.02 M and K = 5×10^10, we compute x = √(0.02/5e10) = √(4e-13) ≈ 2×10^-6.5 ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3x10^-7 M\nDebate agent FXLU, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is 6.3×10−7 M, which exactly matches option 3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent qrA9, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration of approximately 6.3×10^–7 M directly matches choice 3.; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent, selecting correct answer, thinking: Both debate agents concluded that the calculated free Ca2+ concentration of approximately 6.3×10−7 M matches option C.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
