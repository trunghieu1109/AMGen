No calculation is required at this sub‐task.; answer: Restated problem context:\n\nGiven data:\n- Concentration of Ca–EDTA complex: 0.02 M\n- Equilibrium constant K_Ca–EDTA: 5×10^10\n- Temperature: 25 °C\n- Assumption: ideal pH (no protonation complications)\n\nWhat is asked:\n- The free Ca^2+ ion concentration in the solution.\nCoT agent 7Iqo, writing equilibrium expression, thinking: We need to write the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca–EDTA complex based on Sub-task 1. The reaction is Ca–EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻, and the equilibrium constant is defined as the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentration.; answer: Ca–EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\nK_Ca–EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca–EDTA] = 5×10¹⁰\nCoT agent 2vga, setting up equilibrium concentrations, thinking: To set up the equilibrium concentrations we define x as the amount of Ca–EDTA that dissociates. Initially [Ca–EDTA] = 0.02 M, [Ca²⁺] = 0, [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0. At equilibrium, x moles per liter dissociate giving x of each product and (0.02–x) remaining complex.; answer: Let x = [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] formed at equilibrium.\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n[Ca–EDTA] = 0.02 – x\n[Ca²⁺] = x\n[EDTA⁴⁻] = x\nCoT agent eJow, deriving free Ca2+ concentration expression, thinking: We start from the formation constant Kf = [Ca–EDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]). Let C0 = initial [Ca–EDTA] = 0.02 M, x = equilibrium [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–], and [Ca–EDTA]eq = C0 – x. Then Kf = (C0 – x)/(x·x). Because Kf is very large, x ≪ C0, so C0 – x ≈ C0. Thus Kf ≈ C0/x^2, or x^2 ≈ C0/Kf. Therefore [Ca2+] = x ≈ sqrt(C0/Kf).; answer: [Ca2+] ≈ √(C0/Kf) = √(0.02 M / 5×10^10) ≈ 6.3×10^–7 M\nCoT agent V91D, calculating numerical free Ca2+ concentration, thinking: Using the expression from Sub-task 4: [Ca2+] ≈ √(C0/Kf) = √(0.02\u2009M / 5×10^10) = √(4×10^−13) ≈ 6.3×10^−7\u2009M.; answer: [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^−7 M\nDebate agent zVBA, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is 6.3×10^-7 M, which directly matches choice3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent pDor, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca²⁺ concentration ≈6.3×10⁻⁷ M matches option 3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent OL58, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is approximately 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which matches choice 3 (6.3×10⁻⁷ M).; answer: C)\nDebate agent GfsG, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration from Sub-task 5 is approximately 6.3×10^−7 M, which directly matches choice 6.3×10^−7 M in the options.; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent on selecting correct concentration, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is approximately 6.3×10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice 3 (C).; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
