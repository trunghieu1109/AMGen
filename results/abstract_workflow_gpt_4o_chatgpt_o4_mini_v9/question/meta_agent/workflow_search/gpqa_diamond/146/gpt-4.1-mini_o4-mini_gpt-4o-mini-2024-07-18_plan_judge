Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_146
proposed answer: All agents computed the velocity as approximately 0.77c, which directly matches choice 3 (0.77c).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_146
proposed answer: Using energy conservation: initial energy 2m_p c^2=1876MeV equals final 4γm_A c^2=4γ×300MeV, so γ≈1.563. Then v=c√(1−1/γ^2)≈0.77c, matching choice C).
