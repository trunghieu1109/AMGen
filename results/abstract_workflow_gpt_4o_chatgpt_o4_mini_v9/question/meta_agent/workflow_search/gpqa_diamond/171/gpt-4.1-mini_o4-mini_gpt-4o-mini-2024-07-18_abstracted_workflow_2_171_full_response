In a stellar photosphere under LTE, level populations follow the Boltzmann distribution N₂/N₁ ∝ exp(–ΔE/(kT)). The given ratio of excited‐state populations (factor of 2) then directly constrains the temperatures via those exponentials. LTE ensures that collisional and radiative processes establish a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution so we can use that simple formula.; answer: In this context: “excitation level” means the fraction of Fe atoms in a specific excited state vs. the ground (or lower) level. The energy difference ΔE=1.38×10⁻²³ J is the gap between those two levels. Assuming LTE means the level populations follow a Boltzmann distribution N₂/N₁ ∝ exp(–ΔE/(kT)), so knowing that one star has twice the excited‐state population of the other directly relates T₁ and T₂ through that exponential ratio.\nCoT agent tHGO, identifying physical law, thinking: Under LTE, atomic level populations follow the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The number of atoms in a given energy state i is proportional to its statistical weight g_i times exp(–E_i/(kT)), so the ratio of populations of two levels depends exponentially on the energy difference divided by kT.; answer: N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) · exp(–ΔE\u2009/\u2009(k\u2009T))\nCoT agent PMWU, expressing excitation ratio, thinking: Under LTE, excited-state populations follow the Boltzmann factor: N*∝exp(−ΔE/(kT)).  Thus for two stars N1*/N2*=exp(−ΔE/(kT1))⁄exp(−ΔE/(kT2))=exp[ΔE/k·(1/T2−1/T1)].; answer: N1*⁄N2* = exp[ΔE∕k·(1/T2 − 1/T1)]\nCoT agent lzsi, manipulating expression, thinking: Under LTE, N1*/N2* = exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 - 1/T1)]. Given ΔE = 1.38×10^−23 J and k = 1.38×10^−23 J/K, ΔE/k = 1.
