We recognize that under LTE the level populations follow the Boltzmann distribution, with a given excitation ratio and energy difference, and that the unknowns are the effective temperatures of the two stars.; answer: Key physical concepts:\n- Excitation of iron atoms in stellar photospheres\n- Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) implies Boltzmann statistics for level populations\n- Energy difference ΔE = 1.38×10⁻²³ J between the two levels\n\nKnown quantities:\n- Ratio of excited-level populations N₂₁(star₁)/N₂₁(star₂) = 2:1\n- Energy gap ΔE\n\nUnknowns:\n- Effective temperatures T₁ (star₁) and T₂ (star₂)\n\nCoT agent qI3Q, classifying candidate equations, thinking: The sub-task asks to parse each candidate equation’s mathematical structure—what combinations of T₁, T₂ and ln(2) appear—and to label them (e.g., simple ratio, difference over product, etc.) in preparation for matching to the Boltzmann-derived form. This doesn’t require solving for T₁ or T₂ yet, only cataloguing the four options.; answer: Choice 1: ln(2) = T₂/T₁  \n– Structure: simple ratio of temperatures.  \nChoice 2: ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁·T₂)²  \n– Structure: difference of temperatures over the square of their product.  \nChoice 3: ln(2) = (T₁ + T₂)/(T₁·T₂)  \n– Structure: sum of temperatures over their product.  \nChoice 4: ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁·T₂)  \n– Structure: difference of temperatures over their product.\nCoT agent mpOY, deriving Boltzmann relation, thinking: To relate the excited‐state populations of the same iron level in two stars under LTE, we use the Boltzmann factor: N_i∝exp(−E_i/kT). Thus\nN_i(1)/N_i(2)=exp[−E_i/(kT1)]/exp[−E_i/(kT2)]=exp[E_i/k(1/T2−1/T1)]. Setting E_i=ΔE gives the desired relation.; answer: N_exc1/N_exc2 = exp[ΔE/k · (1/T2 − 1/T1)]\nCoT agent sN3Q, manipulating Boltzmann relation, thinking: Starting from N_exc1/N_exc2 = exp[ΔE/k · (1/T2 − 1/T1)] and knowing N_exc1/N_exc2 = 2, we take natural logs: ln(2) = (ΔE/k)·(1/T2 − 1/T1). Noting that ΔE/k = (1.38×10^(-23) J)/(1.38×10^(-23) J/K) = 1\u2009K, and that 1/T2 − 1/T1 = (T1 − T2)/(T1·T2), we recover ln(2) = (T1 − T2)/(T1·T2).; answer: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)\nDebate agent MuGq, round 0, comparing derived expression with candidates, thinking: The theoretical relation gives ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1·T2).

Given ΔE/k = 1\u2009K, this simplifies to ln(2) = 1/T₂ − 1/T₁ = (T₁ − T₂)/(T₁·T₂).
