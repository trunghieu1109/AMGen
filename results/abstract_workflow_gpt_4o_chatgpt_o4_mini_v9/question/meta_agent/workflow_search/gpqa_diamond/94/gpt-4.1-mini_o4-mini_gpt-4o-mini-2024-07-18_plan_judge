Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_94
proposed answer: The Gilman reagent (lithium dialkylcuprate) opens epoxides at the less substituted carbon to yield monohydroxy enones on the hept-1-en-4-one backbone. Among the options, only choice C matches a single hydroxy-substituted hept-1-en-4-one with the correct methyl pattern.

Answer:C)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_48_94
proposed answer: The Gilman reagent will open each epoxide at the less hindered carbon, giving products with a single new methyl and a new alcohol. Neither of these structures (1-methyl-2-hydroxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-5-en-4-one or 5-methyl-6-hydroxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one) matches any of the four provided options Aâ€“D. Thus none align with the expected outcome.

Answer:None of the given choices matches the expected product.

Please provide structural drawings or a clearer substituent numbering scheme to unambiguously correlate the Gilman-opened epoxide products with the answer choices.
Extracted answer: None of the given choices matches the expected product.
