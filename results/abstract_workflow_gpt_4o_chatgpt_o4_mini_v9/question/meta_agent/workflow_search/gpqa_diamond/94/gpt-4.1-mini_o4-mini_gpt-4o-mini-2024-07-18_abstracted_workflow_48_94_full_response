The molecule features two C=C double bonds (one terminal at C1–C2, and one conjugated to the ketone at C5–C6). mCPBA selectively oxidizes alkenes to epoxides, so these two sites are the reactive ones.; answer: The two alkene moieties—namely the terminal C1–C2 double bond and the conjugated C5–C6 double bond—are the reactive sites for epoxidation by mCPBA.\nCoT-SC agent ScbF, determining epoxidation products, thinking: Epoxidation by mCPBA occurs at the two C=C bonds: the terminal 1–2 alkene and the conjugated 5–6 alkene. With 1 equiv mCPBA, each alkene is epoxidized about 50:50, giving two distinct epoxyketones.; answer: The two products are:\n1) 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-5-en-4-one\n2) 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one\nCoT-SC agent nOFi, determining epoxidation products, thinking: mCPBA will epoxidize either the terminal C1–C2 alkene or the conjugated C5–C6 alkene. With one equivalent, each alkene is converted to its epoxide in roughly equal amounts.; answer: The two epoxide products are:\n1) 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-5-en-4-one (epoxide at the terminal C1–C2 double bond)\n2) 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one (epoxide at the conjugated C5–C6 double bond)\nCoT-SC agent zYyO, determining epoxidation products, thinking: mCPBA selectively oxidizes each alkene to its epoxide. With one equivalent, either the terminal C1–C2 double bond or the conjugated C5–C6 double bond is epoxidized, leading to two isomeric epoxides in roughly equal amounts.; answer: 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhepta-5-en-4-one; 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1-en-4-one\nCoT agent n40Y, analyzing Gilman reagent formation and reactivity, thinking: Methyllithium plus CuI forms lithium dimethylcuprate, a soft SN2‐type nucleophile. It opens epoxides at the less substituted carbon. Thus each epoxyketone from Sub‐task 2 undergoes ring opening at its less hindered end, giving two alcohol–ketone products in ~1:1 ratio.; answer: The Gilman reagent opens the 1,2‐ and 5,6‐epoxyketones at their less substituted carbons to give:\n1) 1‐methyl‐2‐hydroxy‐3,3,6‐trimethylhept‐5‐en‐4‐one\n2) 5‐methyl‐6‐hydroxy‐3,3,6‐trimethylhept‐1‐en‐4‐one\nCoT agent hi28, predicting nucleophilic ring-opening products, thinking: The Gilman reagent (lithium dimethylcuprate) opens each epoxide at its less substituted carbon via SN2, placing a methyl at that carbon and giving an alkoxide at the other, which is protonated to an alcohol. Thus the two epoxyketones yield two 1:1 products.; answer: The two products are:\n1) 1-Methyl-2-hydroxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-5-en-4-one\n2) 5-Methyl-6-hydroxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one\nDebate agent TROM, round 0, comparing predicted products with choices, thinking: The Gilman reagent opens the epoxide at the less hindered carbon, adding a methyl and giving an alcohol at the other carbon.
