Determine which choice best matches the identified most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent itns:
Sub-task 3 identified chr/no-chr confusion (2), reference assembly mismatch (3), and incorrect ID conversion (4) as the stealthiest common errors. Among the provided options, choice4 (‘2, 3 and 4’) matches exactly.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent gLuF:
Sub-task 3 identified chr/no chr confusion (2), reference assembly mismatch (3), and incorrect ID conversion (4) as the most stealthy error sources. This aligns with choice 4: 2, 3 and 4.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent itns:
D)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent gLuF:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on which answer choice best matches the most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
