Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_167
proposed answer: Sub-task 3 highlighted issues 2 (chr/no-chr confusion), 3 (reference assembly mismatch), and 4 (incorrect ID conversion) as the most insidious sources of subtle errors. Among the given options, only choice4 (‘2, 3 and 4’) matches these, which corresponds to option D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_167
proposed answer: Sub-task 3 pinpointed the chr/no-chr confusion (2), reference assembly mismatch (3), and incorrect ID conversion (4) as the stealthiest common errors, which directly corresponds to choice 4: 2, 3 and 4.
