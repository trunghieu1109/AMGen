Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_96
proposed answer: Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome involves an extra X chromosome, but one X becomes largely inactivated after fertilization through epigenetic modifications. Histone methyltransferases deposit repressive marks (e.g., H3K27me3) to silence most genes on the supernumerary X, providing dosage compensation and thereby mitigating phenotypic severity compared to trisomy 21, which lacks such a mechanism.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_96
proposed answer: X-inactivation through chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases post-zygotically silences the extra X chromosome in 47,XXY embryos, normalizing X-linked gene dosage and yielding a milder phenotype than trisomy 21.
