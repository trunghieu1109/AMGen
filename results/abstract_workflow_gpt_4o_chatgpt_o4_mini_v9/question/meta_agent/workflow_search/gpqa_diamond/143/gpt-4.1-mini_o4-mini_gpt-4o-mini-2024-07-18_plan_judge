Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_143
proposed answer: The computed mean decay distance L ≃4.12×10⁻¹⁵ m matches closest to 4.0655×10⁻¹⁵ m, corresponding to choice C.
