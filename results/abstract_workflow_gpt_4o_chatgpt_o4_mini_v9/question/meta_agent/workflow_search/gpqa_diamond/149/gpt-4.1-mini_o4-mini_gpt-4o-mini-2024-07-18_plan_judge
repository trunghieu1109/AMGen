Identify the final product.', choice1='4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal', choice2='3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal', choice3='2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal', choice4='2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_149
proposed answer: Diazotization of the amino aldehyde followed by hydrolysis gives p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which under basic heat undergoes self-aldol condensation and dehydration to yield the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. The NMR signals—a single aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm, two aromatic doublets (~6.98 and ~6.51 ppm), phenolic OH signals, and a benzylic CH2 doublet at 3.66 ppm—match this structure. Of the options, only choice A corresponds to 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_149
proposed answer: The diazotization and hydrolysis generate p‐hydroxybenzaldehyde, which under base and heat undergoes self‐aldol condensation and dehydration to give a conjugated enal bearing two p‐hydroxyphenyl rings. The 1H NMR shows an aldehyde triplet at 9.72 ppm, two aromatic AA'BB' doublets (6.98 and 6.51 ppm, 2H each), a benzylic CH2 doublet at 3.66 ppm (J≈6 Hz) and phenolic OH broad signal at 6.27 ppm. These features match 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (choice 3).
