    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;5.48x10^-7 M &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;6.24x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2.81x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;3.97x10^-7 M &#39;}.
