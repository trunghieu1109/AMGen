At pH 7, [H+]=1×10⁻⁷, Ka1=7.5×10⁻³, Ka2=6.2×10⁻⁸, Ka3=1.8×10⁻¹². Calculating gives α0≈8.2×10⁻⁶, α1≈0.617, α2≈0.383, α3≈6.9×10⁻⁶, so H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ predominate.; answer: At pH 7 the distribution of phosphate species is:\nH₃PO₄ (α₀) ≈8.2×10⁻⁶\nH₂PO₄⁻ (α₁) ≈0.617\nHPO₄²⁻ (α₂) ≈0.383\nPO₄³⁻ (α₃) ≈6.9×10⁻⁶\nCoT agent bh5I, classifying phosphate species, thinking: We have initial concentrations [H2PO4–] = 0.03675 M and [HPO42–] = 0.02810 M from the salts. At pH 7 the distribution fractions are α1 ≈ 0.617 for H2PO4– and α2 ≈ 0.383 for HPO42–, while α0 and α3 (H3PO4 and PO43–) are on the order of 10–5–10–6 and thus negligible. Therefore the solution contains predominantly H2PO4– and HPO42– with negligible amounts of H3PO4 and PO43–.; answer: Major species: H2PO4– and HPO42– (from initial salts and pH 7 distribution). Minor/negligible species: H3PO4 and PO43–.\nCoT-SC agent r9hV, calculating orthophosphate concentration, thinking: First calculate total phosphate concentration: from 1.00 g KH2PO4 → [H2PO4–]₀ = (1.00 g/136.09 g·mol–1)/0.200 L = 0.03675 M and from 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O → [HPO42–]₀ = (1.00 g/177.99 g·mol–1)/0.200 L = 0.02810 M. Total [P] = 0.06485 M. Use Henderson–Hasselbalch with pKa2 = –log 6.2×10⁻⁸ ≈ 7.21: pH ≈ 7.21 + log(0.02810/0.03675) = 7.093 → [H⁺] = 8.05×10⁻⁸ M. Distribution fraction for PO4³⁻ is α₃ = (Ka₁·Ka₂·Ka₃)/( [H⁺]³ + Ka₁[H⁺]² + Ka₁Ka₂[H⁺] + Ka₁Ka₂Ka₃ ). Numerically α₃ ≈ 9.73×10⁻⁶. Hence [PO4³⁻] = α₃·0.06485 M ≈ 6.31×10⁻⁷ M, closest to 6.24×10⁻⁷ M.; answer: B)\nCoT-SC agent XaUJ, calculating orthophosphate concentration, thinking: We first compute the pH of the phosphate buffer using Henderson–Hasselbalch (pKa2=–log 6.2×10⁻⁸≈7.21) and the ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]=0.02810/0.03675≈0.765, giving pH≈7.094. Then the fraction of PO4³⁻ is α3=Ka1·Ka2·Ka3/( [H+]³ + [H+]²·Ka1 + [H+]·Ka1·Ka2 + Ka1·Ka2·Ka3 )≈9.73×10⁻⁶. Multiplying by total phosphate (0.03675+0.02810=0.06485 M) yields [PO4³⁻]≈6.31×10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to choice B).; answer: B)\nCoT-SC agent fJKX, calculating orthophosphate concentration, thinking: We have initial [H2PO4–]0 = 1.00\u2009g/136.09\u2009g·mol–1 ÷ 0.200\u2009L = 0.03673\u2009M and [HPO42–]0 = 1.00\u2009g/177.99\u2009g·mol–1 ÷ 0.200\u2009L = 0.02809\u2009M. The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4– ⇌ H+ + HPO42– with pKa2 = 7.21, so pH = pKa2 + log([HPO42–]/[H2PO4–]) = 7.21 + log(0.02809/0.03673) = 7.09. Thus [H+] ≈ 10^(–7.09) = 8.13×10–8\u2009M. Next for HPO42– ⇌ H+ + PO43– (Ka3 = 1.8×10–12): [PO43–] = Ka3·[HPO42–]/[H+] = 1.8×10–12·0.02809/8.13×10–8 ≈ 6.24×10–7\u2009M, which matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nDebate agent UCCW, round 0, comparing with choices, thinking: The calculated orthophosphate concentration is 6.24×10⁻⁷ M, which exactly matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nDebate agent 0XVu, round 0, comparing with choices, thinking: The computed orthophosphate concentration is 6.24×10⁻⁷ M, which matches choice 2 (B).; answer: B)\nDebate agent Ldli, round 0, comparing with choices, thinking: The calculated orthophosphate concentration (6.24×10⁻⁷ M) matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nDebate agent 8dQZ, round 0, comparing with choices, thinking: The calculated [PO43–] is 6.24×10–7\u2009M, which directly matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nFinal Decision agent on multiple-choice selection, thinking: The calculated orthophosphate concentration is 6.24×10⁻⁷ M, which matches choice 2.; answer: B)', iteration_idx=-1)]
