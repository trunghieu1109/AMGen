    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;5.48x10^-7 M &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;6.24x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2.81x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;3.97x10^-7 M &#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on equilibrium concentrations of phosphate species. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent yJRs:
All agents used the Henderson–Hasselbalch approximation for the H2PO4–/HPO42– buffer and then applied Ka1 and Ka3 to find the minor species. Their results converge around the same values. Thus the best estimates are: [H3PO4] ≃ 4.00×10⁻⁷ M, [H2PO4⁻] ≃ 0.0368 M, [HPO4²⁻] ≃ 0.0281 M, [PO4³⁻] ≃ 6.22×10⁻⁷ M.

### answer by Final Decision Agent yJRs:
Equilibrium concentrations of phosphate species: [H3PO4] ≈ 4.00×10⁻⁷ M; [H2PO4⁻] ≈ 0.0368 M; [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.0281 M; [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.22×10⁻⁷ M

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine the total concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution by summing the concentrations of all species that contribute to orthophosphate ion concentration (primarily PO4^3-). Compare this final concentration against the provided answer choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
