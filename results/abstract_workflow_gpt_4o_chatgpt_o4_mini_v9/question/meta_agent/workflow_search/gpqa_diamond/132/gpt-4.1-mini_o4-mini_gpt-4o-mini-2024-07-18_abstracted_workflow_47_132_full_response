Their results converge around the same values. Thus the best estimates are: [H3PO4] ≃ 4.00×10⁻⁷ M, [H2PO4⁻] ≃ 0.0368 M, [HPO4²⁻] ≃ 0.0281 M, [PO4³⁻] ≃ 6.22×10⁻⁷ M.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent yJRs:\nEquilibrium concentrations of phosphate species: [H3PO4] ≈ 4.00×10⁻⁷ M; [H2PO4⁻] ≈ 0.0368 M; [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.0281 M; [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.22×10⁻⁷ M\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine the total concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution by summing the concentrations of all species that contribute to orthophosphate ion concentration (primarily PO4^3-). Compare this final concentration against the provided answer choices.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents="CoT agent jJ2u, calculating moles, thinking: The sub-task requires straightforward calculation of moles using n = mass / molar mass.; answer: Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g ÷ 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol; Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g ÷ 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol\nCoT agent JNJS, calculating molar concentrations, thinking: To find the molar concentrations, divide the moles of each salt by the solution volume in liters (0.200 L):\n- [KH2PO4]: 0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M\n- [Na2HPO4·2H2O]: 0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02810 M; answer: Concentration of KH2PO4 = 0.0368 M; Concentration of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 0.0281 M\nCoT agent 0eqr, identifying species and equilibria, thinking: The question asks to list which phosphate species are present when dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O and to write their dissociation equilibria using the given Ka values. It also asks which of these contribute to the 'orthophosphate ion concentration' and how acid-base equilibria relate. This is straightforward chemical speciation based on a diprotic–triprotic acid.; answer: Sub-task 3: The solid salts dissolve to give primarily H2PO4– (from KH2PO4) and HPO42– (from Na2HPO4·2H2O). In solution, these species are tied together by the phosphoric acid equilibria: 1) H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4–    (Ka1 = 7.5×10–3) 2) H2PO4– ⇌ H+ + HPO42–   (Ka2 = 6.2×10–8) 3) HPO42– ⇌ H+ + PO43–     (Ka3 = 1.8×10–12) As a result of these proton-transfer reactions, small amounts of H3PO4 and PO43– also form at equilibrium. All four species (H3PO4, H2PO4–, HPO42–, PO43–) are part of the total orthophosphate pool, but the main contributors here are H2PO4– and HPO42–, which interconvert according to the Ka2 equilibrium (and to a lesser extent Ka1 and Ka3). The term “orthophosphate ion concentration” typically refers to the sum of all dissolved inorganic phosphate species formed by these equilibria.\nCoT agent Mijr, setting up equilibrium expressions, thinking: To set up Sub-task 4, we write the three acid–base equilibria for phosphoric acid and use ICE tables with the initial concentrations from Sub-task 2. We then express each Ka in terms of equilibrium concentrations and the change variables.; answer: Equilibria and Ka expressions using [H2PO4–]0 = 0.03675 M, [HPO42–]0 = 0.02810 M, and assuming [H+]0 ≈ 1×10–7 M, [H3PO4]0 = 0, [PO43–]0 = 0:\n\n1) H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4–\nICE: [H3PO4]0 = 0, [H+]0 = 1×10–7, [H2PO4–]0 = 0.03675\nChange:   +x1       +x1          –x1\nEq’m:     [H3PO4] = x1\n          [H+]    = 1×10–7 + x1\n          [H2PO4–] = 0.03675 – x1\nKa1 = ([H+][H2PO4–])/[H3PO4] = ( (1×10–7 + x1)(0.03675 – x1) ) / x1 = 7.5×10–3\n\n2) H2PO4– ⇌ H+ + HPO42–\nICE: [H2PO4–]0 = 0.03675, [H+]0 = 1×10–7, [HPO42–]0 = 0.02810\nChange:   –x2       +x2          +x2\nEq’m:     [H2PO4–] = 0.03675 – x2\n          [H+]      = 1×10–7 + x2\n          [HPO42–]  = 0.02810 + x2\nKa2 = ([H+][HPO42–])/[H2PO4–] = ( (1×10–7 + x2)(0.02810 + x2) ) / (0.03675 – x2) = 6.2×10–8\n\n3) HPO42– ⇌ H+ + PO43–\nICE: [HPO42–]0 = 0.02810, [H+]0 = 1×10–7, [PO43–]0 = 0\nChange:   –x3       +x3          +x3\nEq’m:     [HPO42–] = 0.02810 – x3\n          [H+]      = 1×10–7 + x3\n          [PO43–]   = x3\nKa3 = ([H+][PO43–])/[HPO42–] = ( (1×10–7 + x3)(x3) ) / (0.02810 – x3) = 1.8×10–12\nDebate agent ksCj, round 0, calculating equilibrium concentrations, thinking: We treat the mixture as a diprotic buffer: H2PO4– ⇌ H+ + HPO42– (Ka2 dominates pH), then small amounts of H3PO4 and PO43– come from Ka1 and Ka3. Using [H2PO4–]0=0.03673\u2009M and [HPO42–]0=0.02809\u2009M and pKa2=7.21 gives pH=7.21+log(0.02809/0.03673)=7.09 → [H+]=8.1×10–8\u2009M. Then [H3PO4]=[H2PO4–][H+]/Ka1≈3.97×10–7\u2009M, [PO43–]=Ka3[HPO42–]/[H+]≈6.24×10–7\u2009M, with H2PO4– and HPO42– nearly unchanged.; answer: Equilibrium concentrations: [H3PO4]≈3.97×10⁻⁷ M, [H2PO4⁻]≈0.03673 M, [HPO4²⁻]≈0.02809 M, [PO4³⁻]≈6.24×10⁻⁷ M\nDebate agent QVrj, round 0, calculating equilibrium concentrations, thinking: We treat the mixture of H2PO4– and HPO42– as a buffer.  Moles KH2PO4 =1.00\u2009g/136.09=0.007346\u2009mol, Na2HPO4·2H2O=1.00\u2009g/177.99=0.005618\u2009mol in 0.200\u2009L gives [H2PO4–]0=0.03673\u2009M, [HPO42–]0=0.02809\u2009M.  pH≈pKa2+log([base]/[acid])=7.205+log(0.02809/0.03673)=7.088, so [H+]=8.17×10–8\u2009M.  Then from Ka1 and Ka3:  [H3PO4]=[H+][H2PO4–]/Ka1≈(8.17×10–8·0.03673)/7.5×10–3=3.3×10–7\u2009M;  [PO43–]=Ka3·[HPO42–]/[H+]≈(1.8×10–12·0.02809)/8.17×10–8=6.19×10–7\u2009M.

First, pH ≃ pKa2 + log([HPO42–]/[H2PO4–]) = 7.207 + log(0.02809/0.036735) ≃ 7.091, so [H+] ≃ 8.13×10^–8 M.  Then use Ka3 = [H+][PO43–]/[HPO42–] ⇒ [PO43–] = Ka3·[HPO42–]/[H+] = (1.8×10^–12·0.02809)/(8.13×10^–8) ≃ 6.21×10^–7 M.
