{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.9\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;2.4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1.2\n\n&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the calculated minimum redshift from Sub-task 4, compare it with the given multiple-choice options: 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. Select the closest lower limit redshift value for detection with optical ground-based telescopes. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent hQwr:
From Sub-task 4 we found z≈1.96≈2. The closest lower value among the options (1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3) is 1.9, which corresponds to choice1 → A).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent NuCj:
The Lyman-α line enters the optical window at z ≈ (3600 Å/1216 Å)−1 ≃ 1.96. Among the given options (1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3), the closest lower-limit value is 1.9 (choice A).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 8mHC:
The calculated minimum redshift is z≈1.96, so among the choices 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3 the closest lower limit is 1.9, corresponding to choice A).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WpHA:
The minimum redshift from Sub-task 4 is z≈1.96. Comparing to the options: 1.2 (Δ=0.76), 1.9 (Δ=0.06), 2.4 (Δ=0.44), 3 (Δ=1.04), the closest lower limit is 1.9.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent hQwr:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the closest lower limit redshift value.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
