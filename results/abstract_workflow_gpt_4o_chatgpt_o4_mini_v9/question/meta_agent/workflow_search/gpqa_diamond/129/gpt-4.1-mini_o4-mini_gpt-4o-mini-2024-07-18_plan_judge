Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_129
proposed answer: The calculated z_min ≈1.47. Among the given options, the smallest redshift ≥1.47 (i.e., the detection threshold) is 1.9.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_27_129
proposed answer: The Lyman-α line enters the optical window at z ≈ (3600 Å/1216 Å)−1 ≃ 1.96. Among the given options (1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3), the closest lower-limit value is 1.9, corresponding to choice A).
