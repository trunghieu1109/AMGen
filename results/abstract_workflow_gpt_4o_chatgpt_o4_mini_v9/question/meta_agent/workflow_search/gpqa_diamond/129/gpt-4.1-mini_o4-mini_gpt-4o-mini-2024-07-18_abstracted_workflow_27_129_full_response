Optical telescopes observe from near-UV through near-IR, limited by atmospheric cutoff in the UV (~300–350 nm) and strong water/thermal absorption beyond ~900–1000 nm. Standard filters (U, B, V, R, I) span roughly 360–800 nm.; answer: Optical ground-based telescopes typically detect light from about 360 nm to 800 nm (3600–8000 Å), covering the U (∼360 nm), B (∼440 nm), V (∼550 nm), R (∼650 nm), and I (∼800 nm) bands. Atmospheric transmission allows observations roughly in the 300–1000 nm (3000–10 000 Å) window, but the most commonly used visible range is 360–800 nm.\nCoT agent wPVx, explaining Lyman alpha absorption and redshift, thinking: The user requests an explanation (not a simple multiple-choice selection) of how neutral hydrogen clouds absorb Ly-α photons and how redshift shifts the observed absorption wavelength. There’s sufficient information to answer, so no [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: Neutral hydrogen atoms in their ground state can absorb photons that match the energy difference between the n=1 and n=2 levels, corresponding to the Lyman-α transition at a rest-frame wavelength of 1216 Å. A cloud of such atoms along the line of sight to a background quasar will imprint an absorption line at this wavelength in the quasar’s spectrum. However, because the cloud is receding due to cosmic expansion, the absorption feature is redshifted: the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest × (1 + z), where z is the redshift of the cloud. Thus, for a cloud at redshift z, the 1216 Å line is seen at longer wavelengths in the observer’s frame, enabling ground-based optical telescopes (which typically observe from ~3500 Å to ~9000 Å) to detect Ly-α absorption from clouds with z ≳ (3500/1216)−1 ≈ 1.9.\nReflexion CoT agent Llkb, defining redshift formula, thinking: The user asks for the formula relating observed wavelength, emitted wavelength, and redshift z, along with an explanation. This is straightforward cosmological redshift. No missing information or excessive complexity, so no [TOO_HARD] needed.; answer: The relation between observed wavelength (λ_obs), emitted (rest-frame) wavelength (λ_em), and redshift (z) is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_em × (1 + z)\n\nExplanation and implications:\n1. λ_em is the wavelength at which a photon is emitted (for Lyman-α, λ_em = 1216 Å).\n2. Due to cosmic expansion, photons are stretched by the factor (1 + z) as they travel to us; thus the observed wavelength is longer by that factor.\n3. As redshift increases, the absorption line moves from the ultraviolet into the optical band. For example, to detect Lyman-α absorption at the blue end of a ground-based spectrograph (λ_obs ≈ 3500 Å), one needs (1 + z) ≈ 3500/1216 ≈ 2.88, i.e. z ≳ 1.9.\n4. This formula lets observers predict which redshift ranges place key spectral features into observable windows of their instruments.\nCritic agent oW1m, feedback on redshift formula, thinking: The explanation is clear and correct. It correctly states the redshift relation λ_obs = λ_em × (1 + z), defines each term, and explains how cosmic expansion stretches wavelengths and shifts the Lyman-α line from the UV into the optical band. The numerical example for detecting Lyman-α at ~3500 Å leading to z ≳ 1.9 is also appropriate.; answer: λ_obs = λ_em × (1 + z)\n\nExplanation: \n1. λ_em is the rest-frame (emitted) wavelength (for Lyman-α, 1216 Å).\n2. Cosmic expansion stretches photon wavelengths by a factor (1 + z), so the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_em (1 + z).\n3. As z increases, spectral features move redward; e.g., to observe Lyman-α at 3500 Å requires z ≈ (3500/1216) – 1 ≈ 1.88 ≳ 1.9.\nReflexion CoT agent Llkb, refining redshift formula explanation, thinking: The user requests the redshift formula relating observed and emitted wavelengths and an explanation of its implications. This is straightforward to provide without additional data or complexity. No [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: The relation between observed wavelength (λ_obs), emitted (rest–frame) wavelength (λ_em), and redshift (z) is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_em × (1 + z)\n\nExplanation and implications:\n1. λ_em is the wavelength at which the photon was emitted (for Lyman-α, λ_em = 1216 Å).\n2. As the universe expands, photons are stretched by the factor (1 + z), so the observed wavelength is longer by that factor.\n3. Higher redshift means greater stretching: e.g. a cloud at z\u2009=\u20092 shifts Lyman-α (1216 Å) to λ_obs = 1216 × 3 = 3648 Å, moving it from the UV into the optical band.\n4. This formula lets observers predict which redshift ranges place spectral features into their instruments’ observable windows (e.g. ground-based optical spectrographs covering ~3500–9000 Å can detect Lyman-α absorption from clouds with z ≳ (3500/1216)−1 ≈ 1.9).\nCoT agent CbfX, calculating minimum redshift, thinking: We have λ_obs_min ≈3600 Å (360 nm) from Sub-task 1 and λ_em=1216 Å for Lyman-α. Using λ_obs=λ_em(1+z) gives z=(λ_obs/λ_em)−1≈(3600/1216)−1≈1.96, so the absorption enters the optical window at z≳2.; answer: The minimum redshift is z ≈ (3600 Å/1216 Å) − 1 ≈ 1.96 (≈2).\nDebate agent hQwr, round 0, comparing redshift with choices, thinking: From Sub-task 4 we found z≈1.96≈2.
