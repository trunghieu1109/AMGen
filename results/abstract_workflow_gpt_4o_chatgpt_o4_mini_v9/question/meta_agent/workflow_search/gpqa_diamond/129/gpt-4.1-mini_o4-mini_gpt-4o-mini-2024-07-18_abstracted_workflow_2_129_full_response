Key pieces include neutral hydrogen clouds, their Lyman-α transition at rest wavelength ~1216 Å, cosmological redshift shifting this line into the optical band, and the operational wavelength range of ground‐based optical telescopes (typically ~3000–10000 Å). We classify each concept and parameter accordingly.; answer: Key physical concepts and parameters:\n1. Neutral hydrogen clouds: diffuse HI regions in intergalactic space that absorb quasar light.\n2. Lyman-α transition: electronic transition in hydrogen with rest wavelength λ₀ ≃ 1216 Å.\n3. Redshift (z): cosmological Doppler shift given by λ_obs = λ₀ (1 + z).\n4. Optical ground-based telescope detection window: typically λ_obs ≃ 3000–10000 Å, setting a lower limit on z for Lyman-α absorption to be observed in the optical band.\nCoT-SC agent FHMH, clarifying redshift relationships, thinking: The user asks to clarify the physical relationship and definition of redshift and its effect on the observed wavelength of Lyman-α absorption lines, based on previous sub-task. Provide formula and explanation.; answer: Redshift (z) quantifies how much the wavelength of light is stretched by cosmic expansion. If a spectral line has rest‐frame wavelength λ₀ (for Lyman-α, λ₀ ≃ 1216 Å), then an object at redshift z shifts that line to an observed wavelength λ_obs given by:\n\nλ_obs = λ₀ × (1 + z)\n\nThus:\n– z = (λ_obs/λ₀) – 1.\n\nThis relation shows that to detect Lyman-α absorption from a neutral hydrogen cloud at redshift z, the line must be redshifted from 1216 Å into the telescope’s observable window (e.g. ~3000–10000 Å for ground‐based optical telescopes).\nCoT-SC agent Afhe, clarifying redshift relationships, thinking: The user asks to clarify the concept of redshift and its effect on Lyman-α; the information from Sub-task 1 is sufficient and the relationship is straightforward, so no [TOO_HARD] mark is needed.; answer: Relevant physical relationships and definitions:\n1. Redshift (z): a measure of how much the wavelength of light is stretched by the expansion of the universe, defined by z = (λ_obs – λ_rest) / λ_rest.\n2. Observed wavelength of Lyman-α: λ_obs = λ_rest × (1 + z), where λ_rest ≃ 1216 Å.\n3. Detection criterion: for a given telescope sensitivity range (e.g., 3000–10000 Å), only absorbers with z ≥ (λ_min / 1216 Å) – 1 will shift Lyman-α into the observable window.\nCoT-SC agent rCi7, clarifying redshift relationships, thinking: We need to define redshift and show how it shifts the rest‐frame Lyman α line to the observed wavelength.; answer: Redshift (z) quantifies how much wavelengths stretch due to cosmic expansion: z = (λ_obs/λ_rest) – 1. For the Lyman-α line (rest wavelength λ_rest = 1216 Å), the observed wavelength is λ_obs = 1216 Å × (1 + z). Thus, to see Lyman-α in the optical band (e.g. >3000 Å), it must satisfy z ≥ (λ_obs_min/1216 Å) – 1 ≃ (3000/1216) – 1 ≃ 1.47.\nCoT agent 4N5R, determining optical wavelength range, thinking: The question asks for the accessible wavelength range of optical ground-based telescopes, which is set by atmospheric UV cutoff (~3000 Å) and rising sky background plus water vapor bands beyond ~10000 Å, as well as typical CCD sensitivity.; answer: Approximately 3000 Å to 10000 Å\nCoT agent 2QdJ, formulating redshift formula, thinking: The question asks for the direct mathematical relation between the emitted and observed wavelengths in terms of redshift. The standard cosmological redshift formula λ_obs = λ_em\u2009(1+z) applies directly, with λ_em = 1216\u2009Å for Lyman-α. There is no missing information or excessive complexity requiring a [TOO_HARD] tag.; answer: observed_wavelength = 1216 Å × (1 + z)\nDebate agent 32WS, round 0, calculating minimum redshift, thinking: We use the optical window lower limit λ_obs_min≈3000\u2009Å from sub-task 3 and the redshift relation λ_obs=λ_em(1+z) with λ_em=1216\u2009Å. Solve (1+z)=3000/1216⇒z≈3000/1216−1≈1.47.; answer: z_min ≈ 1.47\nDebate agent Uq0j, round 0, calculating minimum redshift, thinking: We set the observed‐wavelength lower limit λ_obs_min≈3000 Å (atmospheric UV cutoff). Using λ_obs=1216 Å×(1+z), solve 1216(1+z)=3000 ⇒1+z=3000/1216≈2.468 ⇒z≈1.468.; answer: z_min ≈1.47\nFinal Decision agent, calculating minimum redshift, thinking: We use the atmospheric UV cutoff λ_obs_min ≈3000 Å and the relation λ_obs = λ_em (1+z) with λ_em = 1216 Å. Solving (1+z) = 3000/1216 gives z ≈1.47.; answer: Sub-task 5: z_min ≈1.47\nCoT agent Hw9S, comparing z_min with choices, thinking: The calculated z_min ≈1.47.
