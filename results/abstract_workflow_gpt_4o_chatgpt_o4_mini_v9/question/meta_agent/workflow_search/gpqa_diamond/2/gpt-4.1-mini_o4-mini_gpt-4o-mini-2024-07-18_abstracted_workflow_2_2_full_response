I will state this and explain the physical meaning of these basis states as spin aligned or anti-aligned with the z–axis.; answer: |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are defined as the eigenstates of the Pauli σ_z operator. By definition: σ_z|↑⟩ = +1·|↑⟩ and σ_z|↓⟩ = –1·|↓⟩. Physically, |↑⟩ is the state of spin ½ aligned along the +z direction (eigenvalue +1) and |↓⟩ is aligned along the –z direction (eigenvalue –1). Thus the given superposition 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ is expressed in the σ_z eigenbasis, confirming that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are indeed the σ_z eigenstates.\nCoT agent y5Cv, analyzing operator and Pauli matrices, thinking: We need to explain the operator 10σ_z+5σ_x by giving matrix forms of σ_z and σ_x in the {|↑⟩,|↓⟩} basis and describe their action on basis states. This is straightforward and no additional info is needed.; answer: The Pauli matrices in the {|↑⟩,|↓⟩} (σ_z) eigenbasis are:\nσ_z = [[1, 0],\n       [0, −1]],\nσ_x = [[0, 1],\n       [1, 0]].\n\nThus 10σ_z + 5σ_x = [[10, 5],\n                   [ 5, −10]].\n\nAction on basis states:\n• On |↑⟩ ≡ (1, 0)^T: (10σ_z+5σ_x)|↑⟩ = (10·1 + 5·0, 10·0 + 5·1)^T = (10, 5)^T = 10|↑⟩ + 5|↓⟩.\n• On |↓⟩ ≡ (0, 1)^T: (10σ_z+5σ_x)|↓⟩ = (10·0 + 5·1, 10·0 + (−10)·1)^T = (5, −10)^T = 5|↑⟩ − 10|↓⟩.\nCoT agent 1hOh, expressing quantum state as vector, thinking: The state coefficients in front of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ directly give the components of the state vector in that basis.; answer: The column vector representation in the {|↑⟩,|↓⟩} basis is [0.5; √3/2].\nCoT agent VvKM, writing operator matrix, thinking: The operator 10σ_z+5σ_x in the |↑⟩,|↓⟩ basis is obtained by summing 10 times σ_z matrix and 5 times σ_x matrix. Using σ_z=[[1,0],[0,-1]] and σ_x=[[0,1],[1,0]], we get [[10,5],[5,-10]].; answer: The matrix form of 10σ_z + 5σ_x in the |↑⟩,|↓⟩ basis is [[10, 5], [5, -10]].\nDebate agent qGTQ, round 0, calculating expectation value, thinking: We have |ψ⟩=[0.5;√3/2] and A=10σ_z+5σ_x=[[10,5],[5,−10]].
