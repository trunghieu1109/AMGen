Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Electron–molecule scattering cross‐sections at 1 MeV are orders of magnitude smaller than molecule–molecule collision cross‐sections at room temperature. High‐energy electrons therefore interact far less frequently with residual gas species than do gas molecules among themselves. Since mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the scattering cross‐section and to the number density of scatterers, a much smaller cross‐section for electrons gives a significantly longer λ. Empirical and theoretical treatments of relativistic electron scattering in ultra‐high vacuum predict λ2 at least ~1.22× larger than the gas‐molecule mean free path λ1.

proposed answer: Electron scattering cross sections at 1 MeV (10⁻²¹–10⁻²² m²) are orders of magnitude smaller than gas–gas molecular cross sections (10⁻¹⁹–10⁻²⁰ m²), so λ2=1/(n·σ_e)≫λ1=1/(n·σ_mol). This far exceeds the 1.22× threshold.
