            "While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be \u03bb1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to \u03bb1; rather, it was \u03bb2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about \u03bb2 based on the aforementioned scenario?",

High\u2010energy electrons therefore interact far less frequently with residual gas species than do gas molecules among themselves. Since mean free path \u03bb is inversely proportional to the scattering cross\u2010section and to the number density of scatterers, a much smaller cross\u2010section for electrons gives a significantly longer \u03bb. Empirical and theoretical treatments of relativistic electron scattering in ultra\u2010high vacuum predict \u03bb2 at least ~1.22\u00d7 larger than the gas\u2010molecule mean free path \u03bb1.\n\nAnswer:\u03bb2 \u2265 1.22\u00b7\u03bb1",
