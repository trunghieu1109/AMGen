This analysis is straightforward and no extra information is required.; answer: Relevant quantum mechanical principles:\n1. Energy quantization: Single-particle energy levels in a 1D infinite well are E_n = n² E, where E = π²ħ²/(2mL²) and n = 1,2,3,...\n2. Spin-½ degeneracy: Each spatial level n can host two spin states (spin up and spin down).\n3. Pauli exclusion principle: Being fermions, no two particles can occupy the same combination of (n, spin) quantum numbers.\n4. Filling scheme: To find system energies, assign the four particles to the lowest available (n, spin) states respecting exclusion.\nCoT-SC agent kLep, classifying energy levels, thinking: We need to state the single-particle energy levels in a 1D infinite well in units of E and explain why they go like n². This follows directly from solving the Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions, giving wave numbers k_n=nπ/L and energies ℏ²k_n²/(2m)=n²(π²ℏ²/(2mL²))=n²E.; answer: The single-particle energy levels are E_n = n²\u2009E, where n = 1,2,3,… and E = π²ℏ²/(2mL²). The n² dependence arises because the allowed wave numbers are k_n = nπ/L, and the kinetic energy is ℏ²k_n²/(2m), which scales as n².\nCoT-SC agent jV83, classifying energy levels, thinking: The question asks for the classification of single-particle levels and the origin of the n² dependence. This follows directly from solving the infinite-well Schrödinger equation, yielding quantized momentum p_n = nπħ/L and hence kinetic energy E_n = p_n²/2m = n²(π²ħ²/2mL²) = n²E.; answer: Single-particle energy levels in a 1D infinite well: E_n = n²E, with n = 1,2,3,…  The n² dependence arises because boundary conditions quantize the particle’s momentum as p_n = nπħ/L, and kinetic energy E_n = p_n²/(2m) ∝ n².\nCoT-SC agent nN4O, classifying energy levels, thinking: We use standard quantum mechanics for a particle in a 1D infinite well: solving the time‐independent Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions ψ(0)=ψ(L)=0 yields standing‐wave solutions sin(nπx/L) with quantized momenta p_n = nπħ/L. The energy is E_n = p_n^2/(2m) = (n^2 π^2 ħ^2)/(2mL^2). Expressing π^2ħ^2/(2mL^2) as the unit E gives E_n = n^2 E.; answer: Single‐particle energy levels: E_n = n^2 E (n=1,2,3,…), so E_1=1E, E_2=4E, E_3=9E, etc. The n^2 dependence arises because the allowed momentum is p_n = nπħ/L, so kinetic energy p_n^2/(2m) scales as n^2.\nReflexion CoT agent umAH, generating configurations, thinking: To list the allowed multi‐particle states, we assign the four fermions to single‐particle levels n with spin ↑ or ↓, obeying Pauli exclusion (max one per (n,σ)).
