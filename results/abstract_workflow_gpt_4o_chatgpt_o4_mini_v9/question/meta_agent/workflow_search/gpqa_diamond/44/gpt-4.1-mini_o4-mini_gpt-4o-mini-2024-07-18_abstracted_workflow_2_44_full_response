Each spatial level n can host two fermions (spin up and spin down). To minimize total energy, we fill the lowest available n values until all four particles are placed.; answer: Sub-task 3: According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Here each level n can hold two spin‐1/2 particles (spin up and spin down).
