{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4E, 10E, 50E&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10E, 15E, 18E\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;4E, 10E, 15E&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;30E, 39E, 50E&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Construct the ground state configuration of the four spin-1/2 particles in the infinite well, filling the lowest available single-particle states consistent with the Pauli principle, and calculate the total ground state energy in terms of E. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KMfk:
Each spatial level n can hold two spin-1/2 fermions (spin up and down). To minimize energy we fill n=1 with two particles and n=2 with two particles. Total energy = 2·(1^2E) + 2·(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent KMfk:
Ground state configuration: (n=1, ↑), (n=1, ↓), (n=2, ↑), (n=2, ↓); Total ground state energy = 10E

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on first excited state energy. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent rEy9:
Both agents agree the first excited state arises by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3, giving occupations n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 and total energy 2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=15E.

### answer by Final Decision Agent rEy9:
15E

### Sub-task 6: Determine the second excited state configuration by promoting particles to higher single-particle energy levels in the next possible way consistent with the Pauli principle, and calculate the total energy of this state in terms of E. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Kjg9:
To find the second excited state we list the next‐lowest total energies above 15E. Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (while keeping both n=2 occupied) gives occupations n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1 with energy 1·1^2E + 2·2^2E + 1·3^2E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E, which is lower than other single‐particle promotions. Hence this is the second excited state.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Kjg9:
Second excited configuration: (n=1, ↑), (n=2, ↑), (n=2, ↓), (n=3, ↑); Total energy = 18E

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states with the given multiple-choice options (4E, 10E, 50E; 10E, 15E, 18E; 4E, 10E, 15E; 30E, 39E, 50E) to identify the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
