Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_44
proposed answer: The calculated energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited), which match choice2.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_44
proposed answer: We computed the system energies as 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 20E (second excited). None of the provided multiple‚Äêchoice sets includes 20E for the second excited state, so there is no matching option.

Answer:None of the provided options match the computed energies (10E, 15E, 20E).
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify the allowed excitation scheme or supply corrected choices including the 20E result.
Extracted answer: None of the provided options match the computed energies (10E, 15E, 20E).
Correct answer: 1
