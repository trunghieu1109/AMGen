This is straightforward and contains no missing information, so no [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: 1) Parallax (plx): the apparent angular shift of a star’s position due to Earth’s orbit, typically measured in arcseconds; it is inversely proportional to distance (d\u2009=\u20091/plx in parsecs). 2) Number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dplx): the differential count of stars whose parallax lies between plx and plx\u2009+\u2009dplx; it measures how many stars fall into each small parallax bin. 3) Uniform distribution assumption: stars are assumed to be spread with constant number density in three-dimensional space, so that within any volume element the number of stars scales simply with the volume of that element.\nCoT-SC agent eodM, analyzing distance-parallax relation, thinking: We know from sub-task 1 that parallax plx is inversely related to distance d: stars farther away have smaller parallaxes. In astronomy’s standard units (arcseconds for plx and parsecs for d), the relationship is d (pc) = 1/plx (arcsec).; answer: Parallax plx (arcseconds) is the reciprocal of distance d (parsecs): plx = 1/d, equivalently d = 1/plx.\nCoT-SC agent 6tEO, analyzing distance-parallax relation, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we know parallax is defined as the apparent angular shift of a star inversely related to its distance. By definition in astronomy (with parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs), plx = 1/d.; answer: plx = 1/d (or equivalently d = 1/plx)\nCoT-SC agent h8II, analyzing distance-parallax relation, thinking: From the definition of stellar parallax, the distance d (in parsecs) is given by d=1/plx (with plx in arcseconds), so parallax is inversely proportional to distance.; answer: The parallax plx (arcsec) is related to the distance d (pc) by plx = 1/d (hence d = 1/plx).\nCoT agent GoBE, characterizing spatial distribution, thinking: Under the uniform‐space assumption, the local number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere, so the density does not change with distance.; answer: The stellar number density n(r) is constant (independent of distance).\nDebate agent ZdQd, round 0, transforming distribution to parallax domain, thinking: Stars are uniformly distributed in space with constant density n. The number in a shell between r and r+dr is dN = 4πn r^2 dr. Parallax plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx and dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Thus dN ∝ r^2 |dr| ∝ (1/plx^2)(d(plx)/plx^2) = d(plx)/plx^4, i.e. N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4.; answer: D)\nDebate agent I41p, round 0, transforming distribution to parallax domain, thinking: We have a uniform spatial density n so dN= n·4πr²dr. With parallax plx=1/r ⇒ r=1/plx, dr=–1/plx² dplx. Thus dN/dplx = n·4πr²·│dr/dplx│ ∝ r²·(1/plx²) = (1/plx²)·(1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴.; answer: The number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as ~1/plx⁴.\nDebate agent 0una, round 0, transforming distribution to parallax domain, thinking: Under uniform spatial density n, the differential number of stars between distances d and d+dd is dN=n·4πd^2dd. With parallax plx=1/d, we have d=1/plx and dd=−1/plx^2\u2009dplx. Substituting gives dN=n·4π·(1/plx^2)·(−1/plx^2\u2009dplx)=−4πn\u2009plx^(−4)dplx, so |dN/dplx|∝1/plx^4.; answer: The number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as ∼1/plx^4.\nDebate agent Jp1u, round 0, transforming distribution to parallax domain, thinking: Under a uniform spatial density n, the number of stars between distances d and d+dd is dN = n·4πd^2·dd. With parallax plx=1/d, we have d=1/plx and dd=–1/plx^2 d(plx). Taking absolute values for the interval, dN = n·4π·(1/plx)^2·(1/plx^2)d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4·d(plx).; answer: Number of stars per unit parallax interval ∝ 1/plx^4.\nFinal Decision agent on transformation, thinking: Transforming uniform spatial density n: dN=4πn r²dr, with plx=1/r⇒dr=−d(plx)/plx² and r=1/plx gives dN/d(plx)∝r²·(1/plx²)=1/plx⁴.; answer: ~1/plx^4\nDebate agent cu3M, round 0, deriving expression for dN/dplx, thinking: We start with a uniform spatial density n, so the differential number of stars in a shell of radius r is dN=4πn r²dr. Since parallax p=1/r ⇒ r=1/p and dr=−dp/p², substitute to get dN = 4πn (1/p²)(−dp/p²) = −4πn dp/p^4. Thus the number per unit parallax is dN/dp = 4πn / p^4, showing a ∝ p^(−4) dependence.; answer: dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4  ⇒  dN/dplx ∝ plx^(−4)\nDebate agent EPzq, round 0, deriving expression for dN/dplx, thinking: Starting from a uniform spatial density n, the infinitesimal number of stars in a shell of radius r is dN = 4π\u2009n\u2009r²\u2009dr.  With the parallax plx = 1/r, we have r = 1/plx and dr = −d(plx)/plx².  Substituting gives dN = 4π\u2009n\u2009(1/plx)²\u2009(1/plx²)\u2009d(plx) = 4π\u2009n\u2009plx⁻⁴\u2009d(plx).  Hence the differential distribution is dN/dplx = 4π\u2009n\u2009plx⁻⁴, revealing a 1/plx⁴ dependence.; answer: dN/dplx = 4π\u2009n\u2009plx⁻⁴  (∝ plx⁻⁴)\nDebate agent bWEr, round 0, deriving expression for dN/dplx, thinking: Starting from a uniform spatial density n, the differential number of stars in a shell of radius r is dN=4π n r^2 dr. With parallax plx=1/r, we have r=1/plx and dr=−d(plx)/plx^2. Substituting gives dN=4π n (1/plx^2)*(d(plx)/plx^2)=4π n d(plx)/plx^4, so dN/d(plx)=4π n / plx^4 ∝ plx^−4.; answer: dN/dplx = 4π·n / plx^4 ∝ plx^−4\nDebate agent AEzF, round 0, deriving expression for dN/dplx, thinking: We start from uniform spatial density n giving dN=4πn r² dr. With parallax plx=1/r, we have r=1/plx and dr=−d(plx)/plx². Substituting yields dN=4πn(1/plx²)(−d(plx)/plx²)=−4πn d(plx)/plx^4, so dN/d(plx)=4πn/plx^4.; answer: dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4, i.e. ∝ plx⁻⁴\nFinal Decision agent on expression derivation, thinking: Starting from a uniform space density, dN=4π n r² dr and with plx=1/r ⇒ dr=−d(plx)/plx², substitution yields dN/d(plx)=4π n / plx⁴, so the dependence is plx⁻⁴.; answer: D)\nCoT agent tjVY, evaluating final expression against choices, thinking: Starting from a uniform space density in Euclidean space, the number of stars in a shell is dN = 4π n r² dr.
