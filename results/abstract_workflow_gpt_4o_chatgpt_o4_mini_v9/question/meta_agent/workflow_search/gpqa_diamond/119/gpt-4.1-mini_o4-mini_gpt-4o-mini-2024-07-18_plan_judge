Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_119
proposed answer: From the derivation in Sub-task 4, the number density per unit parallax scales as dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4, which directly matches choice 4.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_119
proposed answer: Starting from a uniform space density in Euclidean space, the number of stars in a shell is dN = 4π n r² dr. With parallax plx = 1/r, we have dr = -d(plx)/plx². Substituting gives dN/d(plx) = 4π n / plx⁴, so the dependence is ~1/plx⁴, matching choice D).
