    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C12H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C12H12O2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;C11H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C11H12O2&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the inferred molecular structures, debate and compare the given molecular formula options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) to identify which formula best fits the spectral data and structural deductions. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent dgGg:
The 1H NMR showed no –CH2 signals, only two methyls, two vinyl H and two aromatic H, consistent with C11H12O2. C11H14O2 would have two extra hydrogens (likely a –CH2), and both C12 formulas would require an extra carbon (unaccounted by NMR). Thus C11H12O2 best matches.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ISMa:
Comparing the four formulas against the inferred structure (methyl (E)-4-(1-propenyl)benzoate): the molecule has 11 carbons (7 in the benzene + 3 in the propenyl + 1 in the methyl ester), 12 hydrogens (2 aromatic H, 1 vinyl H + 1 vinyl H + 3 CH3 + 3 CH3) and 2 oxygens (ester). C11H14O2 would imply two extra hydrogens (requiring CH2 groups, which are absent), C12H12O2 or C12H14O2 would require an extra carbon not supported by NMR. Therefore C11H12O2 best matches the spectral data and structure.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent dgGg:
C11H12O2

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ISMa:
C11H12O2

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the molecular formula that best fits the spectral data and structural deductions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The NMR shows two aromatic H, two vinyl H (no CH₂), and two CH₃ without any extra CH₂. The inferred structure methyl (E)-4-(1-propenyl)benzoate has 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens, matching C11H12O2. The other formulas would require extra hydrogens or carbons not supported by the spectra.
