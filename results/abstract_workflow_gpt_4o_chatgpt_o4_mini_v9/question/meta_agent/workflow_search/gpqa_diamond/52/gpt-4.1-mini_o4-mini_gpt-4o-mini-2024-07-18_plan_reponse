            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

The inferred structure methyl (E)-4-(1-propenyl)benzoate has 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens, matching C11H12O2. The other formulas would require extra hydrogens or carbons not supported by the spectra.\n\nAnswer:D)",

        "response": "We compare the four candidate formulas against the spectral data: the compound shows an ester (1 degree of unsaturation), a benzene ring (4 DU), and one C=C (1 DU) for a total of 6 DU. Only C11H12O2 gives DU = (2\u00d711+2\u221212)/2 = 6 and matches 12 H (6 in CH3 and 6 in aromatic/vinylic positions), with no \u2013CH2 groups. The other formulas either have too many H or mismatched unsaturation. Therefore C11H12O2 is the best fit.\n\nAnswer:D)",
