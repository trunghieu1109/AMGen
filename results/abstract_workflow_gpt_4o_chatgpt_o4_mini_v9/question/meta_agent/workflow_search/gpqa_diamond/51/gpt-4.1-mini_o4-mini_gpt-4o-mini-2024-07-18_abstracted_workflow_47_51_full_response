These are explicitly stated in the problem description, so I will list them.; answer: Radius: 1.5 R_sun; Mass: 1.1 M_sun; Effective temperature without spots (Teff): 6000 K; Effective temperature with 40% spot coverage: 5500 K; Spot coverage fraction: 40%; Transition wavelength between the two Ti I levels: 1448 Å.\nCoT agent HR6h, characterizing physical context, thinking: Sub-task 2 asks to describe the physical context: in LTE the level populations follow a Boltzmann distribution dependent on temperature and energy difference between levels.; answer: In LTE the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation n2/n1 = (g2/g1)·exp[–ΔE/(kT)], where ΔE = hc/λ (with λ ≃ 1448 Å). As the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K, the exponential factor decreases, reducing the population ratio accordingly.\nCoT agent QjJX, calculating energy difference ΔE, thinking: We use ΔE = hc/λ with h = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s, c = 3.00×10⁸ m/s, λ = 1448 Å = 1.448×10⁻⁷ m. Thus ΔE = (6.626×10⁻³⁴ × 3.00×10⁸)/(1.448×10⁻⁷) ≈ 1.37×10⁻¹⁸ J, which is ≈8.6 eV.; answer: ΔE ≈ 1.37×10⁻¹⁸ J (≈8.6 eV)\nCoT agent 2YYj, formulating Boltzmann ratio, thinking: The Boltzmann distribution in LTE gives the ratio of level populations as N2/N1 = (g2/g1)·exp(-ΔE/(kB·T)).
