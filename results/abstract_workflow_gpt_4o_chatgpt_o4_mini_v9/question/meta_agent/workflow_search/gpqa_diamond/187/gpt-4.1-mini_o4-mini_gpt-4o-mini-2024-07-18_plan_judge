Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_187
proposed answer: The computed d₁₁₁≈1.55 Å is far smaller than any option (~9–10 Å). Comparing absolute differences: |9.54−1.55|≈7.99, |8.95−1.55|≈7.40, |9.08−1.55|≈7.53, |10.05−1.55|≈8.50. The smallest difference is for 8.95 Å, so choice 2 is the closest match.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_187
proposed answer: The calculated interplanar distance d(111) is approximately 9.5308 Å, which most closely matches choice A) 9.54 Å and is physically plausible.
