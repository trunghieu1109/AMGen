No extra data is needed.; answer: The Miller indices are (1 1 1). This plane in a rhombohedral lattice is a high-symmetry, close-packed plane that intersects the a, b, and c axes at one unit-cell length. It often corresponds to a principal diffraction or slip plane due to its high atomic density.\nCoT agent sPub, analyzing lattice vectors, thinking: To define the lattice vectors of a rhombohedral cell with a\u2009=\u200910\u2009Å and α\u2009=\u2009β\u2009=\u2009γ\u2009=\u200930°, use the standard construction: one vector along x, the second in the x–y plane at 30°, and the third chosen so that all pairwise angles are 30°. Numeric values follow from cos\u200930°=√3/2 and sin\u200930°=1/2.; answer: Lattice vectors (in Å, Cartesian) for the rhombohedral cell:  a1 = a·(1,\u20090,\u20090) = (10.000,\u20090.000,\u20090.000)  a2 = a·(cosα,\u2009sinα,\u20090) = (10·0.8660,\u200910·0.5000,\u20090.000) = (8.660,\u20095.000,\u20090.000)  a3 = a·(cosα,\u2009(cosα–cos²α)/sinα,\u2009√[(1+2cos³α–3cos²α)/sin²α]) = (10·0.8660,\u200910·0.2321,\u200910·0.4427) = (8.660,\u20092.321,\u20094.427)  All intervector angles are α=30°.\nCoT agent EPLK, classifying plane orientation, thinking: To classify the (111) plane in a rhombohedral cell we note that Miller indices (hkl) correspond to the reciprocals of the fractional intercepts along the lattice vectors. Here (1,1,1) means intercepts at one full unit cell length along a1, a2, and a3. The plane normal is the [111] direction, equally inclined to all three axes. Thus it is a high-symmetry, low-index plane often associated with close packing or principal slip/diffraction planes.; answer: The (111) plane intercepts the a1, a2, and a3 axes each at one lattice constant (10 Å), so it is equally inclined to all three lattice vectors. Its normal is along [111], making it a high-symmetry, low-index plane. Miller indices are applied by taking reciprocals of these intercepts (1/1, 1/1, 1/1) to give (1,1,1).\nCoT agent LkdT, deriving d-spacing formula, thinking: To derive d-spacing in rhombohedral one uses the general triclinic interplanar‐spacing formula 1/d² = (1/V²)[…] with a=b=c and α=β=γ. Substituting and simplifying (using V = a³√(1–3cos²α+2cos³α)) yields a closed‐form expression in terms of a, α and h,k,l.; answer: For a rhombohedral lattice (a=a=a, α=β=γ), the spacing of the (hkl) plane is\n\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{1-3\\cos^2\\!\\alpha +2\\cos^3\\!\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\!\\alpha +2(hk+hl+kl)(\\cos^2\\!\\alpha-\\cos\\!\\alpha)}}\nCoT agent 86bC, calculating d(111), thinking: We apply the formula d_{111}=a√(1–3cos²α+2cos³α)/√[(h²+k²+l²)sin²α+2(hk+hl+kl)(cos²α–cosα)] with a=10Å, α=30° (cosα=√3/2≈0.8660, sin²α=0.25). Numerator:10√(1–3·0.75+2·0.6495)=10√(0.049)=2.2136. Denominator:√(3·0.25+2·3·(0.75–0.8660))=√(0.75–0.696)=√0.054=0.2324.
