Publicly available data allow an approximate end-to-end efficiency, resolution, noise sources, and limiting magnitudes. This is a straightforward compilation, so no [TOO_HARD] mark is needed.; answer: Technical specifications and performance parameters of ESPRESSO on one 8 m VLT UT (per 1-hour exposure, per binned pixel):\n\n1. Collecting Area and Wavelength Coverage\n   • Primary mirror diameter: 8.2 m (area ≃52 m²).\n   • Spectral range: 380–780 nm.\n\n2. Spectral Resolution and Sampling\n   • High-Resolution (HR) mode: R ≃140 000 (Δλ/λ).\n   • Ultra-High-Resolution (UHR) mode: R ≃190 000.\n   • Sampling: ≃2.4 pixels per resolution element; typical binning is 2×2.\n\n3. Throughput and Efficiency\n   • Atmosphere + telescope optics: ≃60–70% combined.\n   • Fibre link + image scrambler: ≃90%.\n   • Spectrograph optics and grating: ≃50–60%.\n   • Detector quantum efficiency: 80–90% across peak band.\n   • End-to-end throughput: ≃15–20% at peak wavelength.\n\n4. Detector and Noise Characteristics\n   • CCD pixel size: 15 µm.\n   • Read-out noise: ≃2–4 e– RMS (binned).\n   • Dark current: ≲1 e–/pixel/hour (negligible for 1 hr).\n   • Sky background: depends on moon phase and airmass; typically contributes few tens of photons/pixel/hr in V-band.\n\n5. Signal-to-Noise Ratio Factors\n   • Photon noise: √(N_photons) sets fundamental limit.\n   • Read noise becomes relevant for very faint targets (V≳18\u2009mag).\n   • Background noise negligible for V≲16\u2009mag in 1 hr.\n   • Typical S/N≃10 per binned pixel reached at V≃16.0–16.5\u2009mag in 1 hr under good seeing (0.8ʺ) and dark sky.\n\n6. Limiting Magnitude Performance (approx.)\n   • V=12\u2009mag → S/N≃100 in 1\u2009hr.\n   • V=14\u2009mag → S/N≃40–50 in 1\u2009hr.\n   • V=16\u2009mag → S/N≃10 in 1\u2009hr.\n\nKey dependencies: target magnitude, seeing, airmass, sky brightness, binning strategy, and exact operating mode (HR vs UHR).\nCoT-SC agent i610, converting absolute to apparent magnitude, thinking: Using the distance modulus formula m = M + 5\u2009log10(d/10\u2009pc), where M=15\u2009mag for each star and d is distance in parsecs.; answer: c) m = 15.00\u2009mag (d=10\u2009pc)\nd) m ≃ 21.50\u2009mag (d=200\u2009pc)\ne) m ≃ 13.50\u2009mag (d=5\u2009pc)\nf) m ≃ 18.50\u2009mag (d=50\u2009pc)\nCoT-SC agent A1xR, converting absolute to apparent magnitude, thinking: We apply the distance modulus formula m = M + 5\u2009log10(d/10\u2009pc) to each star with absolute V magnitude M=15\u2009mag and given distance d.; answer: Star c (d=10\u2009pc): m = 15 + 5⋅log10(10/10) = 15.0\u2009mag\nStar d (d=200\u2009pc): m = 15 + 5⋅log10(200/10) ≃ 21.5\u2009mag\nStar e (d=5\u2009pc): m = 15 + 5⋅log10(5/10) ≃ 13.5\u2009mag\nStar f (d=50\u2009pc): m = 15 + 5⋅log10(50/10) ≃ 18.5\u2009mag\nCoT-SC agent dSJq, converting absolute to apparent magnitude, thinking: To compute the apparent V magnitude m from absolute magnitude M and distance d in parsecs, use the distance modulus: m = M + 5·log10(d/10).

The assumed “10 at V=16 in 1 hr” is itself mode-dependent. For reliable planning you should use the official ESPRESSO exposure time calculator with your exact setup and observing conditions.; answer: a) Canopus (V=−0.72): ~5×10^7 per binned pixel in 1 hr\nb) Polaris (V=1.98): ~4×10^6 per binned pixel in 1 hr\nc) M=15 at 10 pc (m=15): ~25\nd) M=15 at 200 pc (m=21.5): ~0.06\ne) M=15 at 5 pc (m=13.5): ~100\nf) M=15 at 50 pc (m=18.5): ~1\nReflexion CoT agent KGSU, refining S/N estimation, thinking: We use the empirical scaling that ESPRESSO on one 8\u2009m UT reaches S/N≈10 per binned pixel in 1\u2009hr at V=16\u2009mag under typical conditions, and scale as S/N(m)=10×10^(−0.4×(m−16)).
