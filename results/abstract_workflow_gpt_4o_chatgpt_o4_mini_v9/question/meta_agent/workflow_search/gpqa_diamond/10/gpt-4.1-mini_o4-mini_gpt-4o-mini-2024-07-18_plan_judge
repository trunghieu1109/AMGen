proposed answer: Reviewing the four statements against current literature: statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular mechanisms. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14’s ExoN domain, which functions as a 3′→5′ proofreading exonuclease excising mismatches rather than merely preventing dsRNA breakdown. Therefore statement 2 is false.

proposed answer: Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect SARS-CoV-2’s –1 frameshifting mechanism, ORF3a’s activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and the correlation between pseudoknot conformational heterogeneity and frameshifting efficiency. Statement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp10/nsp14 ExoN complex: its exonuclease activity excises mismatches to proofread RNA, rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown.
