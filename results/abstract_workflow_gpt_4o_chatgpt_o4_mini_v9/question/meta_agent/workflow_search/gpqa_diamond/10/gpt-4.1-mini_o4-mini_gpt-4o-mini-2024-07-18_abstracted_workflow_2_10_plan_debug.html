    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. &#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. &#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the evaluation from Sub-task 3, debate and select the statement that is incorrect by identifying inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or contradictions in the evaluated statements, thereby answering which statement is false regarding SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent cZcI:
Reviewing each statement against current literature: Statement 1 accurately describes SARS-CoV-2 −1 frameshifting and its similarity to SARS-CoV. Statement 3 correctly links ORF3a to caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic pathway without Bcl-2 changes. Statement 4 aligns with data showing two major pseudoknot conformers correlate with frameshifting rates. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14 ExoN—it serves as a 3′→5′ proofreading exonuclease that excises mismatches and can degrade dsRNA, rather than simply preventing dsRNA breakdown. Thus, statement 2 is false.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent UN6v:
Based on the detailed evaluation, statement 2 is incorrect. The nsp10/nsp14 ExoN complex functions as a 3′→5′ exonuclease that excises mismatches and can degrade dsRNA products, rather than simply “preventing the breakdown of dsRNA.”

### answer #1 by Debate Agent cZcI:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent UN6v:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on which statement is incorrect regarding SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Reviewing the four statements against current literature: statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular mechanisms. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14’s ExoN domain, which functions as a 3′→5′ proofreading exonuclease excising mismatches rather than merely preventing dsRNA breakdown. Therefore statement 2 is false.
