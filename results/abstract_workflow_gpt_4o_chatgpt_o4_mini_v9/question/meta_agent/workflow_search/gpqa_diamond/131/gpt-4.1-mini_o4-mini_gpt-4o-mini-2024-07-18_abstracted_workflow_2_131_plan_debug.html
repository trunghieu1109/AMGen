    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on which pairs match aromatic signals. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent FjIm:
Each of the three tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,4,5-; 1,2,3,5-; and 1,2,3,4-) has two equivalent aromatic protons giving a single singlet. Mixing any two in a 1:1 ratio yields two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. 1,4-Diethylbenzene gives two doublets and is excluded.

### answer by Final Decision Agent FjIm:
1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene &amp; 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene; 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene &amp; 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene; and 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene &amp; 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene

### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on which pairs match aliphatic signals. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent xBKo:
To get three singlet signals integrating 12 H, 6 H, and 6 H in a 1:1 mixture, each compound must have two equivalent methyl environments (6 H each) so that one environment from each overlaps (12 H total) and the other two remain distinct (6 H each). Only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene each have exactly two methyl signals, making their mixture produce the observed 2:1:1 pattern.

### answer by Final Decision Agent xBKo:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Integrate the results from Sub-task 5 and Sub-task 6 to determine which pair of compounds from the given options best matches both the aromatic and aliphatic 1H NMR spectral features observed in the mixture. Provide a reasoned conclusion.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Sub-task 5 shows three possible tetramethylbenzene pairs fit the aromatic signals; Sub-task 6 shows only 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene fit the aliphatic 2:1:1 methyl pattern. The common pair is therefore 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.
