Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: Sub-task 5 shows three possible tetramethylbenzene pairs fit the aromatic signals; Sub-task 6 shows only 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene fit the aliphatic 2:1:1 methyl pattern. The common pair is therefore 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_131
proposed answer: Comparing the simulated combined spectra for each candidate pair against the observed data shows that only the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene produces exactly two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, matching the experimental spectrum.
