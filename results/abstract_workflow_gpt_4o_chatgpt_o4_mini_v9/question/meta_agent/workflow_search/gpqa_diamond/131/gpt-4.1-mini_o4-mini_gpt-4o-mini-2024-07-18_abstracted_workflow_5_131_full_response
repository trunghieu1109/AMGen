Only compounds with a single aromatic environment (one singlet) will give one signal; combining two such compounds in equal amounts yields two singlets of equal area. 1,4-Diethylbenzene gives two aromatic doublets, so it cannot match the observed two singlets. The three tetramethylbenzenes each give one aromatic singlet (2H).; answer: 1) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons at positions 3&6 are equivalent → one singlet, integration 2H, ~6.7 ppm. 2) 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons at positions 4&6 are equivalent → one singlet, integration 2H, ~6.8 ppm. 3) 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons at positions 5&6 are equivalent → one singlet, integration 2H, ~6.8 ppm. 4) 1,4-Diethylbenzene: aromatic AA′BB′ → two doublets, integration 2H each, ~7.1 and ~6.8 ppm.

Then compare to observed three singlets at ~2.2\u2009ppm with a 2∶1∶1 integration ratio. Only 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives three singlets in a 6\u2009H\u2009∶\u20093\u2009H\u2009∶\u20093\u2009H ratio (=2\u2009:\u20091\u2009:\u20091) around 2.1–2.3\u2009ppm; the others give only two singlets (6\u2009H\u2009:\u20096\u2009H) or non-singlet patterns.; answer: 1) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (durene): 4 Me in two symmetry-equivalent pairs → two singlets, each 6\u2009H (integration 6:6 → 1:1) at ~2.2\u2009ppm. 2) 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene: 4 Me in three distinct environments (positions 1&5 equivalent → 6\u2009H, positions 2 and 3 inequivalent → 3\u2009H each) → three singlets, integrations 6:3:3 (2:1:1) at ~2.3, 2.2, 2.1\u2009ppm. 3) 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene: 4 Me in two symmetry pairs → two singlets, each 6\u2009H (1:1) at ~2.2\u2009ppm. 4) 1,4-Diethylbenzene: CH2 (4\u2009H) quartet at ~2.8\u2009ppm; CH3 (6\u2009H) triplet at ~1.2\u2009ppm (no singlets). Only 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene predicts three singlets with a 2\u2009:\u20091\u2009:\u20091 integration ratio, matching the observed pattern.\nCoT-SC agent bLSj, analyzing aliphatic protons, thinking: To match three aliphatic singlets in a 2∶1∶1 ratio (i.e. integrals 6H, 3H, 3H), we compare each candidate’s Me or Et protons: 1) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two Me environments, both 6H singlets (6:6) → only two signals, not three. 2) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: three Me environments giving singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (integral ratio 2∶1∶1) → matches exactly. 3) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: two Me environments, both 6H singlets (6:6) → two signals. 4) 1,4-diethylbenzene: CH2 quartet (4H) and CH3 triplet (6H) → two signals and different multiplicities. Thus only 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene predicts three singlets in a 2∶1∶1 ratio matching the observed aliphatic region.; answer: Only 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives three aliphatic singlets in the required 2∶1∶1 ratio.\nDebate agent ra9l, round 0, combining predicted NMR features, thinking: To simulate the combined spectrum, we need to know whether any of the five methyl singlets from the two tetramethylbenzenes overlap into fewer distinct peaks. Without exact δ values (to see which signals coincide), we cannot reduce five predicted singlets to the three actually observed in the aliphatic region. Thus precise chemical shifts are required to assign overlaps and match the 2∶1∶1 ratio exactly.; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the exact chemical shifts of each methyl resonance so we can determine which signals overlap and reproduce the observed three‐peak pattern at ~2.2 ppm.\nDebate agent NGi7, round 0, combining predicted NMR features, thinking: To match the observed two aromatic singlets (each 2H) and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (12H:6H:6H when normalized to total 24 aliphatic H), only the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can give: \n– Aromatic: one singlet (2H) from each compound → two singlets, 1:1 integration.\n– Aliphatic: 1,2,3,5-TMB gives Me singlets 6H, 3H, 3H; 1,2,4,5-TMB gives two equivalent Me singlets of 6H each. One of its 6H signals overlaps with the 6H of 1,2,3,5-TMB to give 12H, plus the two 3H signals → three singlets with areas 12:6:6 → 2:1:1.\nOther pairings either give wrong number of signals or different multiplicities.; answer: A)\nDebate agent rGU6, round 0, combining predicted NMR features, thinking: We need a pair whose combined aromatic spectrum shows exactly two singlets (each 2\u2009H in a 1:1 ratio) and whose combined aliphatic region gives three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene each give one aromatic singlet (2\u2009H), so a 1:1 mixture gives two singlets (2\u2009H each). 1,2,3,5-TMB alone gives three methyl singlets (6:3:3\u2009H → 2:1:1), while 1,2,4,5-TMB gives two methyl singlets (6:6\u2009H). In the mixture the larger 6\u2009H signal of 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6\u2009H of 1,2,3,5-TMB to give a 12\u2009H singlet (normalized to 2), and the two 3\u2009H singlets of 1,2,3,5-TMB remain at their own shifts (normalized to 1:1), matching the observed three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.; answer: For a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene the expected 1H NMR is:  Aromatic region: two singlets at ~6.7\u2009ppm and ~6.8\u2009ppm, each integrating to 2\u2009H (1:1).
