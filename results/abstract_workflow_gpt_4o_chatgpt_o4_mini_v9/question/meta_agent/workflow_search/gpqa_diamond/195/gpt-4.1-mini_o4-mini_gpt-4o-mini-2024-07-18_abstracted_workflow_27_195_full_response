This is straightforward: we have m, A, k, c, Hooke’s law, relativistic kinematics and energy conservation. No missing info or excessive complexity.; answer: Relevant physical quantities:\n- m: mass of the oscillator\n- A: maximum displacement (amplitude)\n- k: spring constant (Hooke’s law F=–kx)\n- c: speed of light\n- x(t), v(t): position and velocity as functions of time\n\nKey assumptions and constraints:\n1. One‐dimensional motion under F=–kx. \n2. Relativistic dynamics: momentum p=γmv, energy E=γmc² + ½kx².\n3. Energy conservation: initial E = rest energy + potential energy at ±A.\n4. Maximum speed v_max occurs when potential energy is zero and all energy is kinetic.\n5. Consistency requires kA²/(2) < mc² (so total energy stays finite and γ is real).\nCoT-SC agent xg5B, reviewing classical max speed, thinking: We start from the classical energy‐conservation relation for a non‐relativistic Hooke’s oscillator. At maximum displacement A, all energy is potential: E=½kA². At the equilibrium position x=0, potential energy is zero and all energy is kinetic: E=½mv_max². Equating gives the classical baseline.; answer: Classical (non‐relativistic) maximum speed: v_max = A * sqrt(k/m).\nCoT-SC agent R5OR, reviewing classical max speed, thinking: To establish a baseline for comparison, recall the classical non‐relativistic harmonic oscillator: energy conservation equates maximum potential energy at amplitude A to kinetic energy at equilibrium. This yields the well‐known vmax. There is no missing information here.; answer: For the classical (non‐relativistic) 1D harmonic oscillator, energy conservation gives ½kA² = ½mv_max², so v_max = A√(k/m).\nCoT-SC agent Ofu3, reviewing classical max speed, thinking: Sub‐task 2 asks for the non‐relativistic limit: use energy conservation for a 1D Hooke’s law oscillator. At maximum displacement x=A all energy is potential (½kA²), and at x=0 all is kinetic (½mv_max²). Equate to find the baseline formula.; answer: v_max = A * sqrt(k/m)\n\nDerivation:\n1. Total energy E = ½kA² at x = A.\n2. At x = 0, E = ½mv_max².\n3. Set ½kA² = ½mv_max² ⇒ v_max = A√(k/m).\nCoT agent FXPg, analyzing relativistic dynamics, thinking: We need to explain how the classical oscillator equations change when momentum and energy are relativistic.  We can write p=γmv, F=dp/dt=−kx, and use energy conservation to find v(x).  The exact trajectory involves an elliptic integral, so we outline the differential equation and energy integral without solving in closed form.; answer: Relativistic momentum: p=γmv with γ=1/√(1−v²/c²).  Newton’s 2nd law becomes\n  d(γmv)/dt=−kx.\nEquivalently,\n  m d/dt(γv)=−kx.\nBecause the force is conservative, use energy conservation rather than solving the above directly:\n  E=γmc²+½kx² = E₀ (constant).\nAt x=A, v=0 so E₀=mc²√(1)+½kA² = mc²+½kA².\nThus for arbitrary x,\n  γmc² = E₀−½kx²  ⇒  γ = (E₀−½kx²)/(mc²).\nHence\n  v(x)=c√{1−1/γ²} = c√{1 − [mc²/(E₀−½kx²)]²}.\nThe full motion x(t) follows from\n  dt = dx/[v(x)] and involves an elliptic integral.  The maximum speed occurs at x=0:\n  v_max = c√{1−[mc²/(mc²+½kA²)]²}.\nThis framework shows how relativistic momentum and energy replace the classical mv and ½mv², leading to modified equations of motion and period.\nCoT agent DqcM, formulating total energy, thinking: From Sub-task 3 we know the relativistic kinetic energy is encoded in γmc² and Hooke’s-law potential is ½kx². Thus the total conserved energy is the sum of relativistic energy and the spring potential.; answer: E_total(x,v) = γ m c² + ½ k x²,  where γ = 1/√(1−v²/c²)\n\nEquivalently, separating out rest energy:\nE_total = (γ−1) m c² + ½ k x² + m c²\nCoT agent iTMe, deriving max speed expression, thinking: Equate energy at x = A: E = m c^2 + ½ k A^2 to energy at x = 0: E = γ m c^2. Thus γ = 1 + kA^2/(2 m c^2) and γ = 1/√(1−v^2/c^2). Solving gives v_max = c √[1 − 1/(1 + kA^2/(2 m c^2))^2], which matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nCoT agent Utyu, simplifying max speed formula, thinking: Starting from γ=1+ kA^2/(2mc^2) and γ=1/√(1−v^2/c^2), solve for v: v_max=c√[1−1/(1+ kA^2/(2mc^2))^2].
