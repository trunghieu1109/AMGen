{&#39;question&#39;: &#34; Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook&#39;s law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the derived formula for v_max with each of the provided choices (choice1 to choice4) to identify which matches the correct relativistic expression, based on Sub-task 6 outputs. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent UhKF:
The derived expression v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2) exactly matches choice2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent uN0P:
The derived expression v_max = c√(1−1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2) exactly matches choice2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent gZ6Y:
The derived expression v_max = c√[1 − 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2] exactly matches the form of choice2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ZVW7:
We derived v_max=c√(1−1/(1+kA^2/(2mc^2))^2) in Sub-task 6. Comparing with the options shows choice 2 exactly matches this expression.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent UhKF:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent uN0P:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent gZ6Y:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ZVW7:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on which choice matches the correct relativistic maximum speed expression.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
