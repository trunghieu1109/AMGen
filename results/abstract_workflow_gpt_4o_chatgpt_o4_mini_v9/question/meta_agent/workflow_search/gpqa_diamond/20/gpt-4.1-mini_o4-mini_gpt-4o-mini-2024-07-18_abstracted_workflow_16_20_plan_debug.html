    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone &amp; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Integrate the results from Sub-task 2 (tautomerism evaluation) and Sub-task 4 (optical isomerism evaluation) to select the correct choice among the given options that identifies the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and the compound that shows optical isomerism (B). 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3SN5:
From Sub-task 2, benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and cannot tautomerize, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. From Sub-task 4, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate does not. Among the given options, choice3 corresponds to A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Va1l:
Tautomerism requires an α-hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl; benzoquinone lacks such hydrogens and cannot tautomerize, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center; methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one, dimethyl fumarate does not. Thus A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice 3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Uzyj:
From Sub-task 2, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. From Sub-task 4, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. This corresponds to choice 3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent A9ZT:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct choice identifying compound A (no tautomerism) and compound B (optical isomerism).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
