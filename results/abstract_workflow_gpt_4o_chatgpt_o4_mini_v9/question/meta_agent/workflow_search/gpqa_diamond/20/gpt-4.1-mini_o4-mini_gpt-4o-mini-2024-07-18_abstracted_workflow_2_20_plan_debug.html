{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone &amp; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Integrate the results from Sub-task 2 (tautomerism evaluation) and Sub-task 4 (optical isomerism evaluation) to identify the correct choice among the given options (choice1 to choice4) that matches the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and the compound that shows optical isomerism (B). 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent DQLL:
Benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens so cannot tautomerize; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center so is optically active; dimethyl fumarate is achiral. Therefore A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, matching choice3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent SfEn:
Benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyls and cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a stereogenic center and exhibits optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate does not. Thus A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which corresponds to choice3 (C).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent DQLL:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent SfEn:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct choice that matches the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and the compound that shows optical isomerism (B).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
