The most common type is keto–enol tautomerism, where a ketone or aldehyde form (keto form) equilibrates with an enol form (a hydroxyl group adjacent to a double bond). Key structural features that allow tautomerism include:\n1. An acidic hydrogen (often on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl or other electron-withdrawing group).\n2. A double bond or lone pair that can relocate when the proton shifts.\n3. Conjugation or hydrogen bonding in one or both tautomers to stabilize each form.\n4. A solvent or environment that can facilitate proton transfer, often via hydrogen-bonding networks.\nCoT-SC agent K8Lr, analyzing tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, thinking: Tautomerism (keto–enol) requires an acidic α-hydrogen next to a carbonyl and a possible shift of a double bond. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and can form an enolic, conjugated (aromatic) tautomer (phloroglucinol). Benzoquinone lacks any α-hydrogen adjacent to its carbonyls, so it cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism.; answer: benzoquinone\nCoT-SC agent FD0T, analyzing tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, thinking: Tautomerism requires an acidic α-hydrogen next to a carbonyl to form an enol. Cyclohexane‐1,3,5-trione has such α-hydrogens and can enolize, whereas benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\nCoT-SC agent 2Spq, analyzing tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, thinking: Tautomerism (keto–enol) requires an acidic hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. 1,4-Benzoquinone has no such α-hydrogen and cannot form an enol tautomer. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto–enol tautomerism (to phloroglucinol).; answer: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\nCoT agent g6bO, defining optical isomerism, thinking: The user asks to define optical isomerism and its structural requirements, such as chirality centers, to prepare for evaluating two compounds. This is straightforward and doesn’t require more data or be too complex.; answer: Optical isomerism arises when a molecule can exist in two non-superimposable mirror‐image forms (enantiomers) that rotate plane‐polarized light in opposite directions. Structural requirements for optical isomerism:\n1. Presence of one or more chirality centers: typically a tetrahedral (sp3) carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n2. Absence of an internal mirror plane: the molecule must lack any symmetry elements that would make it superimposable on its mirror image.\n3. Conformational stability: the chiral centers must not invert rapidly, so that the enantiomers are isolable.\n4. Multiple stereocenters can give diastereomers as well as enantiomers; molecules with chiral axes or planes (e.g., certain allenes, biphenyls) can also be optically active if substitution prevents free rotation.\nCoT-SC agent Zn5N, analyzing optical isomerism of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, thinking: Optical isomerism requires at least one stereogenic (chiral) center: a sp3 carbon bonded to four different groups. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has a central carbon bearing –OH, –H, –CH3, and –COOCH3, making it chiral and optically active. Dimethyl fumarate is a trans‐alkene diester with no stereogenic carbon and no non‐superimposable mirror images (only E/Z stereoisomerism), so it is not optically active.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT-SC agent Hm2A, analyzing optical isomerism of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, thinking: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (e.g. an sp3 carbon with four different substituents) and no internal mirror plane. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic carbon bearing –OH, –H, –CH3, and –COOCH3, so it is chiral and exists as enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate is a trans‐alkene diester with no tetrahedral carbon bearing four different groups; it is achiral.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT-SC agent c5ws, analyzing optical isomerism of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, thinking: According to the definition from Sub-task 3, optical isomerism requires a chiral (sp3) carbon bonded to four different substituents. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (HO–CH(CH3)–COOCH3), the central carbon is bonded to –OH, –CH3, –COOCH3, and –H, fulfilling the requirement and making it chiral. Dimethyl fumarate has a planar C=C and symmetric substituents, so it lacks any chiral centre and cannot be optically active.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nDebate agent 3SN5, round 0, integrating tautomerism and optical isomerism results, thinking: From Sub-task 2, benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and cannot tautomerize, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can.
