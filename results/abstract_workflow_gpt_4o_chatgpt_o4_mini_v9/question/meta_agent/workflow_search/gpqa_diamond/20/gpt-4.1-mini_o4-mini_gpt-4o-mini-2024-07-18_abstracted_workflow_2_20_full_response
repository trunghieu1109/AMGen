This is straightforward and does not lack information, so no [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: Tautomerism is a special kind of structural isomerism in which isomers, called tautomers, readily interconvert by the migration of a proton and a shift of a pi bond. Key characteristics of tautomerism:\n1. Proton Transfer: A hydrogen atom (proton) moves from one atom (often carbon or nitrogen) to another atom (typically oxygen or nitrogen) within the molecule.\n2. Electron Rearrangement: Concurrent with proton transfer, a double bond shifts position to maintain valence requirements and conjugation.\n3. Dynamic Equilibrium: Tautomers exist in rapid equilibrium, with one form usually more stable under given conditions.\n4. Common Types: The most prevalent tautomerism is keto–enol (or aldehyde–enol) tautomerism; others include imine–enamine and ring–chain tautomerism.\nStructural features enabling tautomerism:\n• Presence of an acidic hydrogen adjacent to a multiple bond or heteroatom (α-hydrogen) that can relocate.\n• Capability to form a conjugated system after proton transfer, lowering overall energy.\n• A heteroatom (oxygen, nitrogen) or a carbon–carbon double bond that can accept the migrating proton.\n• The ability to stabilize both tautomeric forms through hydrogen bonding or resonance.\nIn practice, molecules with an α-hydrogen next to a carbonyl or similar electron-withdrawing group and with conjugated pi systems readily undergo tautomerism. These criteria will help assess whether benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize.\nCoT-SC agent faZf, analyzing tautomerism in compounds, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyls (the ring carbons bearing C=O have no H), so it cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH2 groups next to its C=O functions, allowing proton transfer and π-bond shifts to give enol forms, so it does exhibit tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone cannot exhibit tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism.\nCoT-SC agent 78UB, analyzing tautomerism in compounds, thinking: Tautomerism requires an acidic α-hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl (or similar) that can migrate, with concurrent pi-bond shift. Benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens next to its carbonyls, so it cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has methylene (CH2) groups between its carbonyls, providing α-hydrogens and enabling keto–enol tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\nCoT-SC agent rzvy, analyzing tautomerism in compounds, thinking: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens adjacent to each carbonyl and can form a conjugated enol (aromatic phloroglucinol), so it undergoes keto–enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) lacks enolizable hydrogens next to its carbonyls and cannot stabilize an enol form, so it does not show tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.\nCoT agent hx82, analyzing optical isomerism concept, thinking: The user requests an analysis of optical isomerism including its definition, structural requirements (chirality centers), and differences from other isomerism types. No missing info, so provide a complete conceptual explanation without TOO_HARD.; answer: Optical isomerism (a subset of stereoisomerism) occurs when two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Key points:\n\n1. Definition: Optical isomers (enantiomers) rotate plane-polarized light in equal but opposite directions (d- or l- forms).\n\n2. Structural requirements:\n   • A chiral (asymmetric) carbon atom—one bearing four different substituents—is most common.\n   • No internal mirror plane or inversion center.\n   • The molecule must exist in two non-superimposable mirror image forms.\n\n3. How it differs from other isomerism types:\n   • Constitutional isomers differ in connectivity; optical isomers have identical connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement.\n   • Geometric (cis/trans or E/Z) stereoisomers arise from restricted rotation around bonds or rings, not necessarily involving chirality centers; optical isomers specifically involve chirality.\n\nApplication to the given compounds:\n• Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a CH carbon bonded to –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –CO₂Me, making it chiral. Thus it can exist as enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n• Dimethyl fumarate has a planar double bond and no carbon with four different substituents, so it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\nCoT-SC agent 2j6h, analyzing optical isomerism in compounds, thinking: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center—typically a carbon bonded to four distinct substituents—so the molecule can exist as non-superimposable mirror images. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a carbon bearing –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –CO₂Me, making it chiral. Dimethyl fumarate lacks any carbon with four different groups and is planar around its C=C bond, so it cannot be chiral. Therefore, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate does not.\nCoT-SC agent m7ZJ, analyzing optical isomerism in compounds, thinking: Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a stereogenic (chiral) center bearing four different substituents, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a carbon bonded to –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –CO₂Me, making it chiral and thus optically active. Dimethyl fumarate has no such stereocenter and is achiral.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\nCoT-SC agent rpya, analyzing optical isomerism in compounds, thinking: Optical isomerism arises when a molecule contains at least one chiral center—typically a carbon bonded to four different substituents—resulting in non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic carbon (attached to –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –CO₂Me), making it chiral and capable of optical activity. In contrast, dimethyl fumarate lacks any carbon bearing four distinct groups (it is a planar trans-alkene), so it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate does not.\nDebate agent DQLL, round 0, integrating tautomerism and optical isomerism results, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens so cannot tautomerize; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can.
