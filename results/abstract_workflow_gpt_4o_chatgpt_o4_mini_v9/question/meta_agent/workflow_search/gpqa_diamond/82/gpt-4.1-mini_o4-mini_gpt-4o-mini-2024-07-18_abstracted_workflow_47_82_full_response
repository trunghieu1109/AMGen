Moles = M × V = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol.; answer: 0.00100 moles\nCoT agent So6U, calculating total volume after dilution, thinking: The new total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ water to 20.00 cm³ acetic acid solution is simply the sum of volumes: 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.; answer: Total volume = 40.00 cm³\nCoT agent nSKc, calculating new molarity after dilution, thinking: We have 0.00100 mol acetic acid in 40.00 cm³ (0.04000 L) total after dilution. Molarity = moles/volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.0250 M.; answer: 0.0250 M\nCoT agent 8duX, calculating moles of NaOH for 25% titration, thinking: The diluted acetic acid has 0.0250 M in 0.04000 L, so moles of acid = 0.0250 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol. At 25% titration, required NaOH moles = 0.00100 mol × 0.25 = 0.00025 mol.; answer: 0.00025 mol\nCoT agent iV8N, calculating moles of NaOH for equivalence point, thinking: At the equivalence point, one mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, so moles NaOH required = initial moles acid = 0.00100 mol.; answer: Moles of NaOH required = 0.00100 mol.\nCoT agent BSrX, calculating pH at 25% titration, thinking: Initial moles HA = 0.00100 mol. After 25% neutralization: moles A– = 0.00025 mol, HA = 0.00075 mol. Ratio [A–]/[HA] = 0.00025/0.00075 = 0.3333. pKa = –log(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73. pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.3333) ≈ 4.26.; answer: pH = 4.26\nCoT agent PODe, calculating pH at equivalence point, thinking: Initial moles AcOH = 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.00100 mol. At equivalence, moles Ac– = 0.00100 mol. Total volume = 20 mL acid + 20 mL water + 10 mL NaOH = 50 mL = 0.050 L. [Ac–] = 0.00100 mol/0.050 L = 0.0200 M. Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.0×10^–14/1.85×10^–5 ≈ 5.405×10^–10. [OH–] ≈ √(Kb·C) = √(5.405×10^–10×0.0200) ≈ 3.29×10^–6 M. pOH = –log(3.29×10^–6) ≈5.48, so pH = 14 – 5.48 ≈ 8.52.; answer: pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\nDebate agent igMn, round 0, synthesizing final pH values, thinking: From Sub-task 6, pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26.
