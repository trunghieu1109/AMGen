Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_82
proposed answer: All debate agents concur that the calculated pH values (4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at equivalence) exactly match choice2, which corresponds to option B.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_82
proposed answer: Using Henderson–Hasselbalch for 25% titration gives pH≈4.26, and base hydrolysis at equivalence gives pH≈8.52; these match choice 2.
