Total volume after adding 20.00 cm³ water = 40.00 cm³ (0.04000 L). New concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.; answer: 0.025 M\nCoT agent qAmS, identified key chemical parameters, thinking: The sub-task requests identification and classification of the acid dissociation constant, temperature, and titration points. I’ll list each parameter with its classification and related constants for further pH calculations.; answer: Key chemical parameters:\n1) Ka (acetic acid) = 1.85×10⁻⁵ (weak-acid dissociation constant; pKa = 4.73)\n2) Temperature = 25 °C (affects Kw; Kw = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴, pKw = 14.00)\n3) Titration points:\n   - 25% titration: partial neutralization (buffer region; [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.333)\n   - Equivalence point: complete neutralization (solution contains only acetate ion undergoing hydrolysis)\nCoT-SC agent ato0, calculating moles of acetic acid, thinking: Initial moles before dilution: 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol. After dilution, concentration = 0.025 M, volume = 0.04000 L, so moles = 0.025 M × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol. The two values agree, confirming self‐consistency (mass conserved).; answer: Initial moles before dilution = 0.00100 mol; after dilution = 0.00100 mol (consistent).\nCoT-SC agent QQZi, calculating moles of acetic acid, thinking: Initial moles before dilution calculated as 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol. After dilution, using 0.025 M (from sub-task 1) × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol. The mole values match, confirming self-consistency.; answer: Initial moles before dilution: 0.00100 mol; moles after dilution: 0.00100 mol.\nCoT-SC agent 3kA9, calculating moles of acetic acid, thinking: Initial moles of acetic acid before dilution = 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol. After dilution, using C_diluted = 0.025 M and V_total = 0.04000 L gives moles = 0.025 M × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol. The two values match, confirming mass conservation.; answer: Initial moles before dilution: 0.00100 mol; After dilution: 0.00100 mol (self-consistency confirmed).\nCoT-SC agent 4kVF, calculating moles of NaOH added, thinking: Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.00100 mol. At 25% titration, NaOH moles = 0.25 × 0.00100 mol = 0.00025 mol. At equivalence, NaOH moles = 1.00 × 0.00100 mol = 0.00100 mol, matching acid moles (self‐consistent).; answer: Moles NaOH at 25% titration = 0.00025 mol; at equivalence point = 0.00100 mol.\nCoT-SC agent w6be, calculating moles of NaOH added, thinking: We have initial moles of acetic acid = 0.00100 mol. At 25% titration, moles NaOH added = 0.25×0.00100 mol = 0.00025 mol. At equivalence, moles NaOH added = 1.00×0.00100 mol = 0.00100 mol. Ratio 0.00025/0.00100=25% confirms self-consistency.; answer: Moles of NaOH at 25% titration = 0.00025 mol; at equivalence point = 0.00100 mol (self-consistent).\nCoT-SC agent OETg, calculating moles of NaOH added, thinking: Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.00100 mol. At 25% titration, NaOH moles = 0.25×0.00100 = 0.00025 mol. At equivalence, NaOH moles = 1.00×0.00100 = 0.00100 mol. Self–consistency holds (4×0.00025 = 0.00100).; answer: Moles of NaOH at 25% titration = 0.00025 mol; at equivalence point = 0.00100 mol.\nCoT agent TVcz, calculating concentrations at 25% titration, thinking: Step 1: From Sub-task 3, initial moles of HA = 0.00100 mol. Step 2: At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol. Reaction: HA + OH– → A– + H2O, so moles HA consumed = 0.00025 mol and moles A– produced = 0.00025 mol. Remaining HA = 0.00100 – 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Step 3: Total volume = initial 40.00 mL + NaOH volume (0.00025 mol/0.1 M = 2.50 mL) = 42.50 mL = 0.04250 L. Step 4: [HA] = 0.00075 mol/0.04250 L = 0.01765 M; [A–] = 0.00025 mol/0.04250 L = 0.00588 M; no excess OH– remains.; answer: At 25% titration point: [CH₃COOH] = 0.01765 M; [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00588 M; no free OH⁻ present.\nCoT agent A5aj, calculating concentrations at equivalence point, thinking: At equivalence, all acetic acid (0.00100 mol) is converted to acetate. Total solution volume = 40.00 cm3 initial + 10.00 cm3 NaOH ≈ 50.00 cm3 = 0.05000 L. Moles of acetate = 0.00100 mol. Thus [CH3COO–] = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.0200 M. Spectator Na+ also 0.00100 mol in 0.05000 L = 0.0200 M. No free CH3COOH remains.; answer: At equivalence point: [CH3COO–] = 0.0200 M; [Na+] = 0.0200 M; [CH3COOH] ≈ 0.\nCoT agent TRUM, calculating pH at 25% titration, thinking: We use concentrations from Sub-task 5 ([HA]=0.01765 M, [A–]=0.00588 M) and Ka from Sub-task 2 (1.85×10⁻⁵) in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]). pKa = –log(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73. The ratio [A–]/[HA] = 0.00588/0.01765 ≈ 0.333, log(0.333) ≈ –0.477. Thus pH ≈ 4.73 – 0.48 = 4.26.; answer: Step 1: Write Henderson–Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA])\nStep 2: Calculate pKa = –log(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\nStep 3: Calculate ratio [A–]/[HA] = 0.00588/0.01765 ≈ 0.333\nStep 4: Compute pH = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 – 0.48 = 4.26\n\nTherefore, pH at 25% titration point ≈ 4.26\nCoT agent HuMJ, calculating pH at equivalence point, thinking: At equivalence, [CH3COO–] = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.0200 M. Kb for acetate = Kw/Ka = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85×10⁻⁵ = 5.405×10⁻¹⁰. Hydrolysis: CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻, with Kb = x²/(C–x) ≈ x²/C. Solve x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb·C) = √(5.405×10⁻¹⁰·0.0200) = √(1.081×10⁻¹¹) = 3.29×10⁻⁶ M. Then pOH = –log(3.29×10⁻⁶) = 5.48, so pH = 14.00 – 5.48 = 8.52.; answer: pH at equivalence point = 8.52\nDebate agent gjPj, round 0, comparing pH values with choices, thinking: We calculated pH at 25% titration ≈4.26 and at equivalence ≈8.52.
