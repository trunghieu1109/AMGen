proposed answer: To compute del_b we need the eigenvalue spectra of ρ and τ or a specified photon-number cutoff to perform a finite-dimensional diagonalization. Without that information, the von Neumann entropy terms cannot be evaluated numerically.

Answer:del_b = Tr(ρ lnρ) - Tr(τ lnτ)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the eigenvalue spectra {λ_i} of ρ and {μ_j} of τ or specify a finite-dimensional (photon-number) cutoff for numerical diagonalization so that these sums can be evaluated.
Extracted answer: del_b = Tr(ρ lnρ) - Tr(τ lnτ)
