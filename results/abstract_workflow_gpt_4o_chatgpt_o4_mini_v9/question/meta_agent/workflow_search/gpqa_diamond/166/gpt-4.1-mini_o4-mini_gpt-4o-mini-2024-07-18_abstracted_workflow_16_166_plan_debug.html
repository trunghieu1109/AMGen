The state is defined as,\n|psi&gt; =( cos(phi)|alpha&gt; + sin(phi)|-alpha&gt; )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2.48&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1.38&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.25&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on relative entropy measure del_b. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent G8IU:
From Sub-task 4 we have Tr(ρ lnρ)=0 and Tr(τ lnτ)≈−1.40. Hence δₙG=0−(−1.40)=1.40, which when rounded gives ≈1.38.

### answer by Final Decision Agent G8IU:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the computed non-Gaussianity value del_b from Sub-task 5 with the provided multiple-choice options: 2.48, 0, 1.38, 0.25. Identify and justify the closest matching value as the final answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
