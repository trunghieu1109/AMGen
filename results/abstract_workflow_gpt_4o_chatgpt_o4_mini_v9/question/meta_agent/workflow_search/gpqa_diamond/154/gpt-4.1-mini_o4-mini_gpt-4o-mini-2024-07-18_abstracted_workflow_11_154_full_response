The vector’s squared components sum to 1. Acting with P_x in the P_z basis yields -ħ times the vector, confirming it’s the -ħ eigenstate of P_x.; answer: The state ψ=(−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2)ᵀ is normalized (1/4+1/2+1/4=1) and indeed satisfies Pₓψ=−ħ\u2009ψ in the P_z eigenbasis, confirming it correctly represents the Pₓ eigenstate with eigenvalue −ħ.\nCoT agent oSPa, calculating <Pz>, thinking: In the P_z eigenbasis P_z=ħ·diag(1,0,−1).

With ψ components (−1/2,1/√2,−1/2), the probabilities are 1/4,1/2,1/4.
