    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2, determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, and quantify the ratio of their transit probabilities to match the given answer choices. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent R7k5:
Transit probability ∝ R★/a. From sub-task 2, a2/a1 ≃1.65 ⇒ p1/p2≃a2/a1≃1.65, so Planet_1 has ~1.65× higher transit probability, matching choice 1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5N6p:
Transit probability for a circular orbit is p ≃ R★/a. From Sub-task 2 we found a₂/a₁ ≃1.65, so p₁/p₂ ≃1.65, meaning Planet_1 has the higher transit probability by ~1.65×.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent R7k5:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 5N6p:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on which planet to observe based on transit probabilities and given choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
