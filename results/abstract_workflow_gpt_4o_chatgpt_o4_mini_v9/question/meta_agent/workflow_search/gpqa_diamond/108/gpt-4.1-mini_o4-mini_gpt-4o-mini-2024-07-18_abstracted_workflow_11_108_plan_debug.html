{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p&#39;}.

### Sub-task 6: Identify which of the given partial waves (choices) violate either the Pauli statistics condition or the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity, and thus are not permitted final states. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Jvm8:
Pauli: T(NN)=0 requires S+L≡1 mod2. 1) 3P0: S=1,L=1 → S+L=2 even → violates Pauli. 2) 7D1: S=3,L=2 → S+L=5 odd → Pauli ok (though S=3 unphysical for NN, but not asked). 3) 3D3: S=1,L=2 →3 odd → ok. 4) 3S1: S=1,L=0 →1 odd → ok. All conserve J and parity. Thus only choice 1 is forbidden.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent URaP:
We must check Pauli: T=0 requires S+L odd. 3P0 has S=1,L=1 → sum=2 even → violates Pauli. All others satisfy S+L odd and conserve J, P. Hence only 1S0→3P0+s is forbidden.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent xF5p:
We must check the Pauli requirement T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) for T = 0. For each final NN state:
1) ³P₀: S = 1, L = 1 ⇒ S + L + 1 = 3 ≡ 1 (mod 2) ≠ T = 0 ⇒ violates Pauli.
2) ⁷D₁: S = 3, L = 2 ⇒ S + L + 1 = 6 ≡ 0 (mod 2) = T (but S = 3 is unphysical for NN).
3) ³D₃: S = 1, L = 2 ⇒ S + L + 1 = 4 ≡ 0 = T, and J, parity are conserved.
4) ³S₁: S = 1, L = 0 ⇒ S + L + 1 = 2 ≡ 0 = T, and J, parity are conserved.
Thus only choice 1 violates the Pauli condition and is forbidden.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent jRGf:
Pauli statistics: for T(NN)=0 require S+L odd. Choice1: 3P0 has S=1, L=1 ⇒ S+L=2 even ⇒ violates Pauli. Others satisfy S+L odd and also conserve J and parity.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on which partial waves are not permitted.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
