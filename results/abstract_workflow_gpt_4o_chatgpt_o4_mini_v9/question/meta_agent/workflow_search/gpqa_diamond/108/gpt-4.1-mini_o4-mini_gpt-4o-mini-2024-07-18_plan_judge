Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: For T(NN)=0, Pauli statistics require S+L≡1 (mod 2). Choice 1 (³P₀) has S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 (even) → violates Pauli. All other choices satisfy S+L odd and conserve J and parity. Thus only choice 1 is forbidden.

proposed answer: For T(NN)=0, Pauli requires S+L odd. Checking each: 1S0→3P0+s has S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 (even), violating Pauli. It also satisfies J and parity, but fails the Pauli condition. All other options meet S+L odd and conserve J and parity. Hence only choice A is forbidden.
