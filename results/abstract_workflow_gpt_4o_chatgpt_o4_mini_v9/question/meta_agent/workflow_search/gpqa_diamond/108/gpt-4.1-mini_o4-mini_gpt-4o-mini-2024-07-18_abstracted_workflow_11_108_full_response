For a two‐nucleon system in the 1S0 channel the isospin must be T=1 (the NN singlet state). The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity –1.; answer: Initial NN bound state (1S0): S=0; L=0; J=0; T=1; intrinsic parity of X = –1\nCoT-SC agent aGPO, interpreting Pauli condition, thinking: We need to restate the Pauli condition T = (S + L + 1) mod 2 and apply T=0 to find constraints on S and L. Solving (S+L+1) mod2 = 0 gives S+L ≡1 mod2, so S+L must be odd. Thus if S=0 (singlet) L must be odd; if S=1 (triplet) L must be even.; answer: Pauli condition: T(NN) ≡ S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). For T(NN)=0 this implies S + L ≡ 1 (mod 2), i.e. S+L must be odd. Hence spin-singlet (S=0) states require odd L, and spin-triplet (S=1) states require even L.\nCoT-SC agent JBY1, interpreting Pauli condition, thinking: We need to restate the Pauli condition T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod2. With T=0 this implies S+L+1≡0 mod2 → S+L≡1 mod2, so the sum of spin and orbital quantum numbers must be odd. Thus for a spin‐singlet (S=0) the orbital L must be odd, and for a spin‐triplet (S=1) L must be even.; answer: The Pauli condition for the final NN state is T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 (mod 2). With T(NN)=0 this gives S+L≡1 (mod 2), so allowed final states have S+L odd: if S=0 then L is odd; if S=1 then L is even.\nCoT-SC agent WbJU, interpreting Pauli condition, thinking: We apply the Pauli constraint T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). For the final NN state T=0, we have S+L+1 ≡ 0 ⇒ S+L ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus S and L must be opposite in parity.; answer: For T(NN)=0, the Pauli condition S+L+1≡0 mod 2 ⇒ S+L≡1 mod 2. Allowed combinations are:\n• S=0 with L odd\n• S=1 with L even\nCoT agent St6L, analyzing conservation laws, thinking: We need to enforce two conservations for the transition 1S0 → (NN final) + X: \n1) Total J: initial J_i=0 must equal the vector sum J_f (NN) ⊕ l_x (orbital of X).  \n   ⇒ J_i=0 ⇒ J_f and l_x must couple to total zero. This requires |J_f−l_x| ≤ 0 ≤ J_f+l_x, i.e. J_f = l_x.  \n2) Parity: initial parity P_i = (−1)^{L_i}·(intrinsic nucleon parities) = (−1)^0·(+1) = +1.  \n   Final parity P_f = (−1)^{L_f}·(+1)·(intrinsic X parity)·(−1)^{l_x} = (−1)^{L_f+l_x+1}.  \n   Conservation ⇒ P_f = P_i = +1 ⇒ L_f + l_x + 1 must be even ⇒ L_f + l_x odd.  \nWe will use these two conditions in sub-task 4 to test each partial wave choice.; answer: Sub-task 3 answer:  \n– Angular momentum conservation: initial J_i=0 ⇒ final NN total J_f and emitted particle orbital l_x must couple to total zero, so J_f = l_x.  \n– Parity conservation: initial parity +1 ⇒ (−1)^{L_f+l_x+1} = +1 ⇒ L_f + l_x must be odd.\nReflexion CoT agent JSbh, verifying Pauli condition for choices, thinking: We need to extract S, L, J from each final NN term symbol and the orbital angular momentum l_x of X (given by the lowercase letter). Then compute S+L mod 2 and check against the Pauli requirement for T(NN)=0, namely S+L≡1 mod2.; answer: 1) 1S0 → 3P0 + s: Final NN: 3P0 ⇒ S=1, L=1, J=0; X: s ⇒ l_x=0. S+L=1+1=2 (even) ⇒ fails (needs odd).\n2) 1S0 → 7D1 + p: Final NN: 7D1 ⇒ S=(7−1)/2=3, L=2, J=1; X: p ⇒ l_x=1. S+L=3+2=5 (odd) ⇒ satisfies.\n3) 1S0 → 3D3 + f: Final NN: 3D3 ⇒ S=1, L=2, J=3; X: f ⇒ l_x=3. S+L=1+2=3 (odd) ⇒ satisfies.\n4) 1S0 → 3S1 + p: Final NN: 3S1 ⇒ S=1, L=0, J=1; X: p ⇒ l_x=1. S+L=1+0=1 (odd) ⇒ satisfies.\nReflexion CoT agent fzPY, checking conservation laws for choices, thinking: Initial state: J_i=0, P_i=+1. For each final NN+X: • Angular momentum conservation requires J_NN = l_x (so they can couple to 0). • Parity conservation: P_f = (−1)^{L_NN+l_x}·(intrinsic X parity) = (−1)^{L_NN+l_x}·(−1) must equal +1 ⇒ L_NN+l_x must be odd.
