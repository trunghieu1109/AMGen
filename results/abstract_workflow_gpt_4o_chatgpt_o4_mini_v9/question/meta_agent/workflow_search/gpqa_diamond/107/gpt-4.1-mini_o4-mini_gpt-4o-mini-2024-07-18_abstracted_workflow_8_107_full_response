For m≈1 and B=1\u2009T, μ_B≈9.27×10^−24\u2009J/T.; answer: ⟨H⟩=m\u2009μ_B\u2009B≈9.27×10^−24\u2009J (for m=1,\u2009B=1\u2009T)\nCoT-SC agent 9mpt, calculating transition energy, thinking: To find ΔE we use E=hc/λ with h=6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s, c≈3.00×10⁸ m/s, λ=0.4861×10⁻⁶ m. Compute numerator 6.626×10⁻³⁴×3.00×10⁸≈1.9878×10⁻²⁵ J·m, divide by 4.861×10⁻⁷ m to get ≈4.09×10⁻¹⁹ J, corresponding to ≈2.55 eV.; answer: Sub-task 2: ΔE=hc/λ=(6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s·3.00×10⁸ m/s)/(0.4861×10⁻⁶ m)≈4.09×10⁻¹⁹ J (≈2.55 eV)\nCoT-SC agent DTrY, calculating transition energy, thinking: We use the photon energy formula E = hc/λ with h = 6.626×10^−34 J·s, c = 3.00×10^8 m/s, and λ = 0.4861×10^−6 m. Calculating gives E = (6.626×10^−34·3.00×10^8)/(0.4861×10^−6) ≈ 4.09×10^−19 J, which is about 2.55 eV.; answer: ΔE = hc/λ ≈ 4.09×10^−19 J (≈ 2.55 eV)\nCoT-SC agent yaVE, calculating transition energy, thinking: Use the photon‐energy formula ΔE = hc/λ. With h = 6.626×10^−34 J·s, c = 3.00×10^8 m/s, and λ = 0.4861×10^−6 m, we get ΔE = (6.626×10^−34×3.00×10^8)/(0.4861×10^−6) ≈ 4.09×10^−19 J. Converting to electronvolts via 1 eV = 1.602×10^−19 J gives ≈2.55 eV.; answer: ΔE ≈ 4.09×10^−19 J (≈ 2.55 eV)\nCoT agent SsMK, comparing magnitudes, thinking: Comparing <H> ≈9.27×10^-24 J with ΔE ≈4.09×10^-19 J shows <H> is about 10^5 times smaller than ΔE, hence ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.; answer: A)\nCoT agent GB2Z, selecting correct choice, thinking: Sub-task 3 found ⟨H⟩≈9.27×10⁻²⁴\u2009J and ΔE≈4.09×10⁻¹⁹\u2009J, so ⟨H⟩ is about 10⁵ times smaller than ΔE, i.e. ⟨H⟩≪ΔE.; answer: A)', iteration_idx=-1)]
