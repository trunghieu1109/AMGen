    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;F is used for the synthesis of dyes.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C is a flammable gas.&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 13: Integrate the evaluations of all statements (Sub-tasks 9 to 12) to identify which statement about the products in the reaction sequence is incorrect. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent bWsx:
Sub-task evaluations: (1) D (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) has two equivalent proton environments, giving two singlets (correct). (2) F (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) is used in dye synthesis (correct). (3) H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) gives a violet complex with FeCl3, not yellow (statement incorrect). (4) C (propyne) is a flammable gas (correct). The only incorrect statement is choice 3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 70to:
Based on sub-tasks: D gives two singlets (valid), F used in dyes (valid), H gives violet not yellow (invalid), C is flammable gas (valid). Only statement 3 is incorrect.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent bWsx:
C)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 70to:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 13: Make final decision on which statement is incorrect.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
