Since the first step is bromination in CCl4 (an electrophilic addition), the substrate must be an alkene. Therefore A is propene, which is a flammable gas.; answer: Compound A is propene (CH2=CH–CH3). The only other C3H6 isomer is cyclopropane, but the observed bromination requires the alkene, so A is propene.\nCoT agent oADP, analyzing bromination to form Compound B, thinking: Bromination of propene in CCl4 proceeds by anti addition of Br2 across the C=C bond, yielding a vicinal dibromide. There is no ambiguity in regiochemistry: propene gives 1,2-dibromopropane as a racemic mixture of enantiomers.; answer: Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3–CHBr–CH2Br), a colorless, dense liquid (racemic), insoluble in water, with a relatively high boiling point.\nCoT agent CL73, examining reaction to form Compound C, thinking: 1,2-Dibromopropane on treatment with alcoholic KOH undergoes two successive dehydrohalogenations to yield the alkyne propyne (methylacetylene). This reaction proceeds via elimination of two equivalents of HBr from adjacent carbons.; answer: Compound C is propyne (methylacetylene), a colorless, flammable gas.\nCoT agent Lyzu, determining Compound D and NMR features, thinking: Passing propyne (methylacetylene) over red-hot iron filament catalyzes cyclotrimerization of three C3H4 units to form a C9H12 aromatic. The only symmetrical trimethylbenzene isomer is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which by its D3h symmetry shows two 1H NMR singlets: one for the three equivalent aromatic H’s and one for the nine equivalent methyl H’s.; answer: Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which gives two singlets in its 1H NMR spectrum.\nCoT agent 8Jlw, analyzing formation of Compound E, thinking: Nitration of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Compound D) with a mixture of conc. HNO3 and H2SO4 introduces a nitro group ortho to one of the methyls (all positions equivalent by symmetry), yielding 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This reaction converts the hydrocarbon into an aromatic nitro compound.; answer: Compound E is 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, featuring an aromatic ring with three methyl groups and one nitro (-NO2) functional group; it is an aromatic nitro compound.\nCoT agent T90C, identifying Compound F and uses, thinking: Reduction of the nitro group in 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Compound E) by Fe/HCl yields the corresponding aromatic amine, specifically 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.; answer: Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine), commonly used as an intermediate in the synthesis of dyes, particularly azo dyes.\nCoT agent wJeV, determining Compound G, thinking: An aromatic primary amine on treatment with nitrous acid at 0–5 °C is converted into the corresponding diazonium salt. Here, 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine) gives the aryl diazonium chloride, which is only stable in cold, strongly acidic solution and decomposes above 5 °C with loss of N₂. It is reactive in coupling and substitution.; answer: Compound G is 2-diazonio-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene chloride (the diazonium salt of mesidine). It is stable only in cold (0–5 °C) acid solution, decomposes above 5 °C with evolution of N₂, can be explosive when dry, and undergoes facile substitution or coupling reactions.\nCoT agent brS3, analyzing Compound H and its properties, thinking: Compound G is the diazonium salt of mesidine (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Treatment with warm NaOH leads to hydrolysis of the diazonium group to give the corresponding phenol, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol). This is a well‐known Sandmeyer hydrolysis. The resulting phenol is weakly acidic, has limited water solubility, and gives characteristic color reactions with FeCl₃.; answer: Upon warming G with NaOH, the diazonium group is replaced by –OH to yield 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol). H is a weakly acidic phenol (pKa ≈10.2), sparingly soluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. With neutral FeCl₃ solution it forms a colored complex (reddish-violet to purple), confirming the phenolic –OH.\nCoT agent a3pk, evaluating NMR statement for Compound D, thinking: Compound D is identified as 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which has D3h symmetry. All three aromatic protons are equivalent and all nine methyl protons are equivalent, giving two distinct proton environments. Each environment appears as a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum.; answer: The statement is valid; Compound D gives two singlets in its 1H NMR spectrum.\nCoT agent WvrJ, assessing dye synthesis use of Compound F, thinking: Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine), which is indeed employed as an intermediate in the manufacture of azo dyes. Therefore the claim that F is used for dye synthesis is accurate.; answer: The statement is correct.\nCoT agent azci, verifying color reaction of Compound H, thinking: Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol). Phenolic –OH groups form colored complexes with FeCl₃, typically purple to violet, not yellow. Therefore the statement that H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride is incorrect.; answer: The statement is incorrect: Compound H gives a violet (reddish-purple) color with FeCl₃, not yellow.\nCoT agent HDJp, checking flammability and state of Compound C, thinking: Compound C is formed by double dehydrohalogenation of 1,2-dibromopropane to give propyne (methylacetylene). Propyne is a gas at room temperature and is flammable like other alkynes.; answer: The statement is correct: Compound C is indeed a flammable gas.\nDebate agent bWsx, round 0, debating incorrect statement, thinking: Sub-task evaluations: (1) D (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) has two equivalent proton environments, giving two singlets (correct). (2) F (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) is used in dye synthesis (correct). (3) H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) gives a violet complex with FeCl3, not yellow (statement incorrect).
