            "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ",

        "response": "Raising the pH from 1 to 4 cuts [H+] by a factor of 10^3, directly slowing an acid\u2010dependent rate\u2010determining step. The exothermic temperature rise would accelerate the reaction (Arrhenius), and there\u2019s no significant pressure or volume effect. Thus the increased pH is the dominant factor causing the slower rate.\n\nAnswer:D)",

The exothermic temperature rise slightly increases rate, and any dilution or pressure changes are negligible relative to the loss of proton catalyst.\n\nAnswer:D)",
