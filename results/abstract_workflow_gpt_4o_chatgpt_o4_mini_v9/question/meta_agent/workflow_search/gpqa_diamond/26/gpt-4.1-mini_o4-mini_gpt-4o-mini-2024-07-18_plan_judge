Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_26
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle is the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds the nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome at the rough ER membrane (cytosolic face), pauses translation, and directs the chain into the ER for N-linked glycosylation (“some sugar”). From there the protein enters the secretory pathway and is eventually exported outside the cell (extracellular space).

proposed answer: The SRP (ribonucleoprotein particle) binds the nascent chain on the cytosolic face of the rough ER membrane, where it pauses translation and targets the chain for cotranslational translocation into the ER lumen for glycosylation. After passage through the Golgi, the protein is secreted outside the cell. This corresponds to a route from the cytosol to the extracellular space.
