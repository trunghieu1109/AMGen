Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_87
proposed answer: High variability in the V_H region among proliferating B cells in Peyer’s patches reflects point mutations introduced during affinity maturation in germinal centers, which is characteristic of somatic hypermutation.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_87
proposed answer: The high variability in the V_H gene sequences of proliferating B cells in Peyer’s patches after antigen exposure is characteristic of somatic hypermutation, which introduces point mutations in the variable regions during germinal center reactions to increase antibody affinity. Other processes either don’t alter V region sequences (complement activation, class switching) or occur only during early development (VDJ recombination).
