Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_40
proposed answer: The relativistic addition of velocities gives u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v), which exactly matches option 3.

proposed answer: The basic checks at v=0 and n=1 confirm the formula reproduces the stationary-medium speed and vacuum speed, but they do not test its behavior in extreme or nonideal situations. A full plausibility check would examine other limits (v→1, n→∞), group versus phase velocity, dispersion, causality, and relativistic consistency of energy–momentum transfer. These additional tests are beyond the simple two‐point checks provided.

Answer:Limitations of the v=0 and n=1 checks:
1. They cover only two trivial special cases and do not probe extreme parameter regimes (e.g. v→1 or n→∞).
2. They test only phase velocity, not group velocity or signal velocity in dispersive media.
3. They ignore absorption, boundary conditions, and anisotropy in real materials.
4. They do not verify relativistic consistency of energy–momentum exchange or causality constraints.
5. No check is made for intermediate regimes where v and n yield nontrivial Doppler or aberration effects.
