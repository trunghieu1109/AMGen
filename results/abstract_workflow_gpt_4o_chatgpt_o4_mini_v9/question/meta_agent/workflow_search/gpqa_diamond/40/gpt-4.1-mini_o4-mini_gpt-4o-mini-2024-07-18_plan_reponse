A full plausibility check would examine other limits (v\u21921, n\u2192\u221e), group versus phase velocity, dispersion, causality, and relativistic consistency of energy\u2013momentum transfer. These additional tests are beyond the simple two\u2010point checks provided.\n\nAnswer:Limitations of the v=0 and n=1 checks:\n1. They cover only two trivial special cases and do not probe extreme parameter regimes (e.g. v\u21921 or n\u2192\u221e).\n2. They test only phase velocity, not group velocity or signal velocity in dispersive media.\n3. They ignore absorption, boundary conditions, and anisotropy in real materials.\n4. They do not verify relativistic consistency of energy\u2013momentum exchange or causality constraints.\n5. No check is made for intermediate regimes where v and n yield nontrivial Doppler or aberration effects.",
