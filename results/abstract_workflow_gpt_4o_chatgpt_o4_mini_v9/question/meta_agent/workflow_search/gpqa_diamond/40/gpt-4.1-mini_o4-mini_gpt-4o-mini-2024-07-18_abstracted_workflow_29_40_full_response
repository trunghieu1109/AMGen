No multiple-choice answer is requested, just a descriptive restatement.; answer: A light beam travels inside a slab of glass (refractive index n). The glass slab itself moves at constant velocity v (in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer) relative to the laboratory frame. We set the vacuum speed of light c=1.

The glass has refractive index n, and we use units where the vacuum speed of light c=1.

This includes describing the motion of the glass and the light beam, defining n, v, c=1, and specifying the reference frames involved.; answer: Sub-task 1: A light beam travels through a glass slab that moves at constant velocity v (positive toward the observer) in the same direction as the beam. The glass has refractive index n. We choose units so that the vacuum speed of light c=1.

It does not test other important regimes (e.g. v→1 to ensure u remains subluminal, negative v to check symmetry, n→∞, etc.), nor does it probe dispersion or angular dependence. A more thorough validation would include: 1) verifying u<1 for all 0≤v<1 and n>1, 2) checking the v→1 limit explicitly, 3) comparing with the relativistic velocity‐addition form of the Fresnel dragging formula, and 4) exploring off‐axis propagation or frequency‐dependent (dispersive) effects.\nReflexion CoT agent l17v, refining verification, thinking: The basic checks at v=0 and n=1 confirm the formula reproduces the stationary-medium speed and vacuum speed, but they do not test its behavior in extreme or nonideal situations. A full plausibility check would examine other limits (v→1, n→∞), group versus phase velocity, dispersion, causality, and relativistic consistency of energy–momentum transfer.
