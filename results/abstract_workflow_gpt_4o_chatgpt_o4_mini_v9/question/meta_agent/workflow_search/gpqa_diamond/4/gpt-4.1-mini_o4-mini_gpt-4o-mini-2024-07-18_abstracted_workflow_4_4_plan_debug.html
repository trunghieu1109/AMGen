{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the normalized eigenvector solution. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Tp3r:
Solving (P·n)|ψ⟩ = +ħ/2|ψ⟩ gives (cosθ−1)c₁ + sinθ c₂ = 0 ⇒ c₂/c₁ = (1−cosθ)/sinθ = tan(θ/2). Normalizing |c₁|²[1+tan²(θ/2)] = 1 yields c₁ = cos(θ/2), c₂ = sin(θ/2).

### answer by Final Decision Agent Tp3r:
(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the derived normalized eigenvector elements from Sub-task 5 with the given multiple-choice options to identify the correct form.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
