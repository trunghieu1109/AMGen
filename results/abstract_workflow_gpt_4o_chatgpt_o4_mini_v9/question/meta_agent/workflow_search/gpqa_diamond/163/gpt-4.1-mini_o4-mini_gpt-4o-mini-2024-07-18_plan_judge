Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_163
proposed answer: The computed mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.42, which is closest to option ~0.4.
