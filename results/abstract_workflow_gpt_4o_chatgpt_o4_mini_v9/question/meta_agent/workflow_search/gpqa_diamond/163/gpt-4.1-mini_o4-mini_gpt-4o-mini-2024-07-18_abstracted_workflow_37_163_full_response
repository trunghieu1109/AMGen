For system_1: K1=10, K2=5, so M1/M2=5/10=0.5. For system_2: K1=15, K2=10, so M1/M2=10/15≈0.67.; answer: System_1 mass ratio M1/M2 ≈ 0.5; System_2 mass ratio M1/M2 ≈ 0.67\nCoT-SC agent beNc, calculating mass ratios, thinking: We use the relation mass ratio = inverse ratio of RV amplitudes (M1/M2 = K2/K1). For system_1: K1=10, K2=5 ⇒ M1/M2=5/10=0.5. For system_2: K1=15, K2=10 ⇒ M1/M2=10/15≈0.67. No additional data needed.; answer: System_1 mass ratio (M1/M2) ≈ 0.5; System_2 mass ratio (M1/M2) ≈ 0.67\nCoT-SC agent 08ki, calculating mass ratios, thinking: The mass ratio of two stars in a spectroscopic binary is the inverse ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes: M1/M2 = K2/K1. For system_1, K1=10\u2009km/s and K2=5\u2009km/s, so M1/M2=5/10=0.5. For system_2, K1=15\u2009km/s and K2=10\u2009km/s, so M1/M2=10/15≈0.67.

From Kepler’s third law for a two‐body system: (M1+M2) = 4π²(a1+a2)³/[G\u2009P²]. The semi-major axes are a1=K1P/(2π) and a2=K2P/(2π). Converting P to seconds and K to m/s: \n\nSystem_1: P1=2\u2009yr=6.312×10⁷\u2009s; K1=10\u2009km/s=1×10⁴\u2009m/s, K2=5\u2009km/s=5×10³\u2009m/s.  \na1=1×10⁴×6.312×10⁷/(2π)=1.005×10¹¹\u2009m;  a2=5.03×10¹⁰\u2009m;  a=a1+a2=1.508×10¹¹\u2009m.  \nM_tot,1=4π²(1.508×10¹¹)³/[6.67×10⁻¹¹×(6.312×10⁷)²] ≈5.09×10²9\u2009kg ≈0.26\u2009M☉.  \n\nSystem_2: P2=1\u2009yr=3.156×10⁷\u2009s; K1=15\u2009km/s=1.5×10⁴\u2009m/s, K2=10\u2009km/s=1×10⁴\u2009m/s.  \na1=1.5×10⁴×3.156×10⁷/(2π)=7.53×10¹⁰\u2009m;  a2=5.02×10¹⁰\u2009m;  a=1.255×10¹¹\u2009m.  \nM_tot,2=4π²(1.255×10¹¹)³/[6.67×10⁻¹¹×(3.156×10⁷)²] ≈1.18×10³0\u2009kg ≈0.59\u2009M☉.; answer: Sub-task 3: Total mass of system_1 ≈5.1×10²9\u2009kg (≈0.26\u2009M☉); Total mass of system_2 ≈1.18×10³0\u2009kg (≈0.59\u2009M☉).\nCritic agent x1yF, feedback round 0, thinking: The numerical procedure is formally correct—using edge-on circular orbits and Kepler’s third law with a1=K1P/(2π), a2=K2P/(2π), and Mtot=4π²(a1+a2)³/(GP²) yields ≈5.1×10²⁹ kg (0.26 M⊙) for system 1 and ≈1.18×10³⁰ kg (0.59 M⊙) for system 2. However, the result relies on several strong assumptions and has limitations:\n1. Inclination: Assumes i=90°, so sin\u2009i=1. Any deviation reduces the true mass (M∝1/sin³i).  \n2. Orbit shape: Assumes perfectly circular orbits; eccentricity would alter the velocity–phase relation and semi-major axes.  \n3. Measurement errors: Errors in P and K directly propagate as M∝P(K1+K2)³.  \n4. Third light or additional bodies: Unseen components or light contamination can bias K measurements.  \n5. Simplified two-body: Neglects tidal distortions and relativistic effects, which may matter in tight or high-mass systems.; answer: Under the standard binary‐mass formula M₁+M₂ = (P/(2πG))\u2009(K₁+K₂)³, one finds M_tot,1 ≈0.26 M⊙ and M_tot,2 ≈0.59 M⊙. These are *minimum* masses (sin\u2009i=1); relaxing any of the above assumptions increases the inferred mass.\nReflexion CoT agent 2UIz, refining total masses, thinking: Using the edge-on (i=90°) circular-orbit assumption, we compute each star's semi-major axis as a=KP/(2π) (with P in seconds and K in m/s), sum them to get a_total, and then apply Kepler’s third law M_total=4π²a_total³/(GP²). Converting periods (2 yr, 1 yr) and velocities yields ≈5.1×10^29 kg (0.26 M☉) for system_1 and ≈1.18×10^30 kg (0.59 M☉) for system_2.; answer: Sub-task 3: Total mass of system_1 ≈5.1×10^29 kg (≈0.26 M☉); Total mass of system_2 ≈1.18×10^30 kg (≈0.59 M☉).\nDebate agent dd6y, round 0, computing mass ratio, thinking: We divide the total masses from Sub-task 3: 5.1×10^29\u2009kg / 1.18×10^30\u2009kg ≈ 0.43. The closest multiple-choice option is ~0.4, corresponding to choice A).; answer: A)\nDebate agent RkJI, round 0, computing mass ratio, thinking: We take the masses from Sub-task 3: M1≈0.26 M☉ and M2≈0.59 M☉. The ratio M1/M2≈0.26/0.59≈0.44. This assumes edge‐on, circular orbits. Deviations from i=90° or nonzero eccentricity would change the amplitudes and thus the inferred masses and ratio.; answer: M1/M2 ≈ 0.44 (~0.4)\nDebate agent MFEJ, round 0, computing mass ratio, thinking: We take the total masses from Sub-task 3: M1≈5.1×10^29\u2009kg and M2≈1.18×10^30\u2009kg. The ratio M1/M2=5.1e29/1.18e30≈0.432. This is a straightforward division, but note it relies on the assumptions of edge-on (i=90°) circular orbits and precise RV amplitudes. Deviations in inclination or orbital eccentricity, as well as measurement errors in K and P, could introduce ~10–20% uncertainty in the ratio.; answer: Sub-task 4: The ratio of system_1’s total mass to system_2’s total mass is M1/M2 ≈ 0.43. This result depends on the edge-on circular-orbit assumption and the measured RV amplitudes; uncertainties in inclination or eccentricity could shift the ratio by about 10–20%.\nDebate agent niB4, round 0, computing mass ratio, thinking: We have total masses from Sub-task 3: M1≈5.1×10^29 kg, M2≈1.18×10^30 kg.
