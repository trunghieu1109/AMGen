Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_140
proposed answer: The reaction yields three distinct organic products—two anilines (one retaining deuterium and one with hydrogen) plus recovered starting material—corresponding to choice B.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
