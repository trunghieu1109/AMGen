{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the number of distinct organic products. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent T8wR:
Both debate agents agree that the reaction yields three distinct organic products: two anilines (with and without deuterium) and recovered starting material. Therefore, the correct choice corresponding to three is B).

### answer by Final Decision Agent T8wR:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the number of possible organic products obtained with the given multiple-choice options (1, 2, 3, 4) to select the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
