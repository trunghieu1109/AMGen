    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overlineAD$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\fracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$..

### Sub-task 5: Verify calculations for consistency and arithmetic accuracy. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent lMST:
The power-of-a-point relation AD × AP = AB × AC = 50 was applied correctly. The arithmetic leading to AP = 50/AD is consistent. However, since AD is not computed from the provided triangle data, the numerical evaluation remains incomplete. This indicates that further geometric analysis (such as computing the circumradius or using tangent properties) is needed.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent lMST:
The calculations are arithmetically consistent (AP = 50/AD), but incomplete due to the absence of AD. [TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Supply additional geometric details (e.g., determine the circumradius or use tangent length properties) to compute AD and fully resolve AP.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Prepare segment length AP in form m/n and compute m + n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300

    <pre>We placed the triangle in the coordinate plane with A = (0,0), B = (5,0), and solved for C so that AC = 10 and BC = 9. Then we found the circle through A, B, C and computed its center and equation. The tangents at B and C were determined using the fact that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Their intersection, D, was computed and its coordinates found to be (305/22, 15√14/11). The power-of-a-point relation at A, with respect to the circle, gives AD × AP = AB × AC = 50. With AD computed as the distance from A to D, we got AD = 325/22, leading to AP = 50/(325/22) = 44/13. Written in lowest terms AP = 44/13 so m + n = 44 + 13 = 57.
