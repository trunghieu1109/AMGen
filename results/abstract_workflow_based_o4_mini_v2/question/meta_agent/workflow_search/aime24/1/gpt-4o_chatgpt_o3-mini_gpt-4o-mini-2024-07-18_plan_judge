Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We placed the triangle in the coordinate plane with A = (0,0), B = (5,0), and solved for C so that AC = 10 and BC = 9. Then we found the circle through A, B, C and computed its center and equation. The tangents at B and C were determined using the fact that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Their intersection, D, was computed and its coordinates found to be (305/22, 15√14/11). The power-of-a-point relation at A, with respect to the circle, gives AD × AP = AB × AC = 50. With AD computed as the distance from A to D, we got AD = 325/22, leading to AP = 50/(325/22) = 44/13. Written in lowest terms AP = 44/13 so m + n = 44 + 13 = 57.

proposed answer: The chain‐of‐thought above revealed a discrepancy: the computed value for AP was an irrational expression (50√31/31), while AP is expected to be given as m/n with m and n relatively prime integers, leading to m+n being an integer. Reexamining the full solution would require a careful use of the circumradius formula, tangent–secant theorem, and the properties of the A‐symmedian (since AD is the tangent intersection line) to correctly determine AP. Based on a reassessment drawing on these observations, a candidate final answer for m+n is 41. However, since the details remain unresolved in our current decomposition, further elaboration is needed.

[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Reevaluate the determination of the tangent lengths and the use of harmonic division in the configuration by applying the circumradius formula and the sine law to deduce AP in the required rational form.
