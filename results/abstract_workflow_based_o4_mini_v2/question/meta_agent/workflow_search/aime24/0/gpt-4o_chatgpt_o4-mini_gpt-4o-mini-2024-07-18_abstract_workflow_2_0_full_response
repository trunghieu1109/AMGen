Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

At speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h, walking time =9/3=3 hours=180 minutes. Including coffee time gives 180+24=204 minutes.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent KSzf (yourself):\n204\n\n### please review the walking time calculation and provide feedback on its accuracy. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent s90f:\nThe calculation is correct. At speed 3 km/h the walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours (180 minutes), and adding the 24-minute coffee break gives 204 minutes in total.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Using results from sub-task 1, calculate Aya\'s walking time at speed s+0.5 including coffee time. \n\n ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent KSzf (yourself):\nGiven s=2.5 km/h and t=24 min, at speed s+0.5=3 km/h walking time is 9/3=3 hours (180 minutes). Adding the 24-minute coffee break gives 204 minutes total.\n\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent KSzf (yourself):\n204\n\n### please review the walking time calculation and provide feedback on its accuracy. \n\n ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent s90f:\nThe calculation is accurate. With s=2.5 km/h and t=24 min, walking at 3 km/h gives 9/3=3 h (180 min), plus 24 min coffee break, totaling 204 min.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Using results from sub-task 1, calculate Aya\'s walking time at speed s+0.5 including coffee time. \n\n ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent KSzf (yourself):\nFrom sub-task 1 we have s=2.5 km/h and t=24 min. At speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h, walking time is 9/3.0=3 hours or 180 minutes.
