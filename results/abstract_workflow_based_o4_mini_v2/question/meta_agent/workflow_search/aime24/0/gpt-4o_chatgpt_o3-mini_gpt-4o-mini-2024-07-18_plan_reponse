When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",
        "correct_answer": "204",
        "n": "abstract_workflow_1_0",
        "response": "Using the results from the related sub-task responses, we know that Aya's walking speed s = 2.5 km/h and the coffee shop stop time t = 24 minutes. Therefore, when she walks at s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, the pure walking time is 9 km divided by 3 km/h = 3 hours (or 180 minutes). Adding the 24-minute coffee stop, the total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nAnswer:204",

        "response": "With the validated values of s = 2.5 km/h and a coffee shop break of 24 minutes, when Aya walks at s + 0.5 km/h = 3 km/h, her walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours. Adding the 24-minute (0.4 hours) break gives a total time of 3.4 hours, which converts to 204 minutes.\n\nAnswer:204",
