Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To find the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize, we first identify the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4) = 210. Jen's chosen 4 numbers are fixed. The grand prize corresponds to the event that the 4 drawn numbers exactly match Jen's chosen numbers, which can happen in exactly 1 way. The prize-winning event corresponds to the drawn 4 numbers having at least 2 numbers in common with Jen's chosen 4 numbers. We calculate the number of draws with exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches: exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90; exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24; exactly 4 matches: 1. Total prize-winning draws = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Therefore, P(grand prize) = 1/210 and P(prize) = 115/210. The conditional probability is P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is in lowest terms, so m=1 and n=115. The problem asks for m + n = 1 + 115 = 116. Hence, the final answer is 116.
