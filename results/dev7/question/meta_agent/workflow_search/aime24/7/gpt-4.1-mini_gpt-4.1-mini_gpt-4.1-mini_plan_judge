proposed answer: Starting from the given logarithmic equations, we first convert them into exponential form: log_x(y^x) = 10 implies y^x = x^{10}, and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms of both sides, we get two equations: (1) x ln y = 10 ln x and (2) 4y ln x = 10 ln y. From equation (1), we express ln y = (10 ln x) / x. Substituting this into equation (2) gives 4y ln x = 10 * (10 ln x) / x = 100 ln x / x. Since x > 1, ln x > 0, so dividing both sides by ln x yields 4y = 100 / x, or y = 25 / x. Now, the product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25. We verify the domain constraints: x > 1 and y = 25 / x > 1 implies x < 25, so x is in (1, 25) and y in (1, 25). Substituting back into the original equations confirms they hold true. Therefore, the product xy is constant and equals 25 for all valid x and y satisfying the given equations and constraints.
