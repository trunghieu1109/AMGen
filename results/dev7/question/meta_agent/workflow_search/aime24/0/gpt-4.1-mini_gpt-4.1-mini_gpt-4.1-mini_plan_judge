Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: We have previously found s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. Let's verify the total times for the two given speeds and check if they match the problem's conditions. For s = 2.5 km/h, walking time = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3 hours 36 minutes. Adding coffee shop time t = 24 minutes, total time = 3 hours 36 minutes + 24 minutes = 4 hours, which matches the problem statement. For s + 2 = 4.5 km/h, walking time = 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Adding coffee shop time t = 24 minutes, total time = 2 hours + 24 minutes = 2 hours 24 minutes, which also matches the problem statement. Now, for s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, walking time = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours. Adding coffee shop time t = 24 minutes, total time = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes. This is consistent with the previous calculations and the problem constraints. The times decrease as speed increases, and the coffee shop time remains constant, so there are no contradictions. Therefore, the final computed total time of 204 minutes is reasonable and consistent with the original problem.

Answer:The total time including the coffee shop time when Aya walks at 3.0 km/h is 204 minutes.
Extracted answer: The total time including the coffee shop time when Aya walks at 3.0 km/h is 204 minutes.
Correct answer: 204
