Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: To find the length of CE, we start by placing rectangle ABCD in the coordinate plane for clarity. Let A be at (0,0). Since AB=107 and BC=16, B is at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). Rectangle EFGH has EF=184 and FG=17. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and since D and C lie on the line y=16, E and F must also lie on this line. We place E at (3,16) and F at (187,16) so that EF=184 (187-3=184). Then H and G are vertically above E and F by 17 units, so H is at (3,33) and G at (187,33). The points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), and G(187,33) are concyclic, which can be verified by finding a circle passing through these points. The length CE is the horizontal distance between C(107,16) and E(3,16), which is |107 - 3| = 104. This satisfies all given conditions including the collinearity and concyclicity constraints. Therefore, the length of CE is 104.
