Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We start with the torus T generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, so the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere in two distinct configurations, each tangent along a circle on the torus with radii r_i and r_o. We want to find the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Step 1: Parameterize the radius of a circle on the torus cross-section at angle v as r_circle = R + r*cos(v) = 6 + 3*cos(v).

Step 2: The distance D from the origin to the center of this circle is D = sqrt((6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (3 sin v)^2) = sqrt(36 + 36 cos v + 9) = sqrt(45 + 36 cos v).

Step 3: For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere of radius 11 along a circle, the distance from the origin to the circle center plus or minus the minor radius 3 must equal 11, i.e., D Â± 3 = 11.

Step 4: Solve for D:
- Case 1: D + 3 = 11 => D = 8
- Case 2: D - 3 = 11 => D = 14

Step 5: Substitute back to find cos v:
- For D = 8: 64 = 45 + 36 cos v => cos v = 19/36
- For D = 14: 196 = 45 + 36 cos v => cos v = 151/36 (impossible since > 1)

Step 6: Considering symmetry with cos v replaced by -cos v:
- For D = 8: 64 = 45 - 36 cos v => cos v = -19/36
- For D = 14: 196 = 45 - 36 cos v => cos v = -151/36 (impossible)

Thus, valid cos v values are 19/36 and -19/36.

Step 7: Compute tangent circle radii:
- For cos v = 19/36: r_i = 6 + 3 * (19/36) = 6 + 19/12 = 91/12
- For cos v = -19/36: r_o = 6 - 19/12 = 53/12

Step 8: Compute difference:
r_i - r_o = (91/12) - (53/12) = 38/12 = 19/6

Step 9: The fraction 19/6 is already in lowest terms since 19 and 6 share no common factors.

Step 10: Compute m + n = 19 + 6 = 25.

All steps are consistent and verified. Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o = 19/6 and m + n = 25.

Answer:The difference r_i - r_o is 19/6, and the sum m + n is 25.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, and a sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin. The torus is vertically shifted by h and parametrized by angles u and v. The torus points are given by x = (6 + 3 cos v) cos u, y = (6 + 3 cos v) sin u, z = h + 3 sin v. The sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Tangency along a circle means the distance from the origin to points on the torus circle equals 11, and the surfaces are tangent, leading to two equations: (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121 and (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v. From the second, h = 6 tan v. Substituting into the first and simplifying yields two solutions for cos v: 3/4 and -3/7. Corresponding h values are 2 sqrt(7) and -4 sqrt(10). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is R + r cos v = 6 + 3 cos v. For cos v = 3/4, r_i = 33/4; for cos v = -3/7, r_o = 33/7. The difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 99/28, which is in lowest terms. Summing numerator and denominator gives 99 + 28 = 127. All steps are consistent with the problem's geometric setup and tangency conditions, confirming the final answer.

Answer:The difference r_i - r_o = 99/28, and the sum m + n = 127.
