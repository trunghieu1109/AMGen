Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent vkes', content="The problem involves a torus generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, and a sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin. The torus is vertically shifted by h and parametrized by angles u and v. The torus points are given by x = (6 + 3 cos v) cos u, y = (6 + 3 cos v) sin u, z = h + 3 sin v. The sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Tangency along a circle means the distance from the origin to points on the torus circle equals 11, and the surfaces are tangent, leading to two equations: (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121 and (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v. From the second, h = 6 tan v. Substituting into the first and simplifying yields two solutions for cos v: 3/4 and -3/7. Corresponding h values are 2 sqrt(7) and -4 sqrt(10). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is R + r cos v = 6 + 3 cos v. For cos v = 3/4, r_i = 33/4; for cos v = -3/7, r_o = 33/7. The difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 99/28, which is in lowest terms. Summing numerator and denominator gives 99 + 28 = 127.

We define the vertical displacement parameter h as the vertical shift of the center of the generating circle from the origin (which is the center of the sphere). The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nStep 1: Parametric equations of the torus with vertical shift h.\n\nThe generating circle of radius 3 is centered at (6, 0, h) in 3D space, where the axis of revolution is the z-axis. The torus is formed by revolving this circle around the z-axis.\n\nLet u be the angle parameter for the revolution around the z-axis (0 ≤ u < 2π), and v be the angle parameter for the generating circle (0 ≤ v < 2π).\n\nThe parametric equations of the torus are:\n\nx(u,v) = (6 + 3 cos v) cos u\n\ny(u,v) = (6 + 3 cos v) sin u\n\nz(u,v) = h + 3 sin v\n\nHere, (6 + 3 cos v) is the distance from the z-axis, and h + 3 sin v is the vertical coordinate, shifted by h.\n\nStep 2: Implicit equation of the sphere centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nThe sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0) with radius 11, so its implicit equation is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121\n\nStep 3: Validation.\n\n- The torus parametric equations correctly represent a torus with major radius 6 and minor radius 3, shifted vertically by h.\n- The sphere equation is standard and centered at the origin.\n\nThus, the torus and sphere are modeled correctly with the vertical displacement h included in the torus parametric equations.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent d7Uw:\nThe torus with vertical displacement h is parametrized by angles u and v as:\n\nx(u,v) = (6 + 3 cos v) cos u\n\ny(u,v) = (6 + 3 cos v) sin u\n\nz(u,v) = h + 3 sin v\n\nwhere 0 ≤ u,v < 2π.\n\nThe sphere centered at the origin with radius 11 has the implicit equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize tangency condition equations involving h and v. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent VIqD:\nWe start with the torus parametrized by (u,v) with a vertical shift h:\n\nx(u,v) = (6 + 3 cos v) cos u\n\ny(u,v) = (6 + 3 cos v) sin u\n\nz(u,v) = h + 3 sin v\n\nThe distance squared from the origin (center of the sphere) to a point on the torus is:\nD^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2\n\nExternal tangency along a circle parameterized by v means the distance from the origin to the torus points on that circle equals the sphere radius 11:\n\n(6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121\n\nFor tangency along a circle, the surfaces must also be tangent in the direction normal to the circle, so the distance function D(v,h) must have a critical point at that v, i.e., dD/dv = 0.\n\nCalculating dD/dv = 0 leads to the condition:\n(h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v\n\nTherefore, the two tangency conditions involving h and v that must be satisfied simultaneously are:\n\n1) (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121\n\n2) (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v\n\nThese equations characterize all possible external tangent configurations between the torus and the sphere along circles parameterized by v with vertical shift h.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent VIqD:\nThe tangency conditions involving h and v are:\n\n1) (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121\n\n2) (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v\n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously to describe the external tangency of the torus and the sphere along a circle parameterized by v.\n\n### Sub-task 1: Select consistent (h,v) solutions for tangent configurations. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent ymVo:\nWe start with the two tangency conditions for the torus and sphere: (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121 and (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v. From the second equation, rearranging gives h cos v = 6 sin v, so h = 6 tan v. Substituting h = 6 tan v into the first equation and simplifying leads to (6 + 3 cos v)^2 / cos^2 v = 121. Taking square roots yields 6 + 3 cos v = ± 11 cos v. For the positive root, 6 + 3 cos v = 11 cos v implies cos v = 3/4. For the negative root, 6 + 3 cos v = -11 cos v implies cos v = -3/7. Calculating h for each case using h = 6 tan v, we find h = 2 sqrt(7) for cos v = 3/4 and h = -4 sqrt(10) for cos v = -3/7. These two pairs (h, v) correspond to the two external tangent configurations of the torus resting on the sphere. Thus, the consistent solutions are (h, v) = (2 sqrt(7), arccos(3/4)) and (h, v) = (-4 sqrt(10), arccos(-3/7)).\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent ymVo:\n(h, v) = (2 sqrt(7), arccos(3/4)) and (h, v) = (-4 sqrt(10), arccos(-3/7))\n\n### Sub-task 2: For each tangent configuration (h, v) found, compute the radius of the tangent circle on the torus, denoted r_i and r_o respectively. Use the torus parameters and angle v to express the radius accurately. Verify these radii correspond to the geometric setup and that the difference r_i - r_o is meaningful. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vPr2:\nWe have two tangent configurations for the torus resting on the sphere, given by (h, v) = (2 sqrt(7), arccos(3/4)) and (h, v) = (-4 sqrt(10), arccos(-3/7)). The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius r) around an axis at distance 6 (major radius R). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus at angle v is the radius of the cross-sectional circle at that v, which is simply the minor radius r = 3. However, the problem states the tangent circle has radius r_i or r_o, which corresponds to the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus surface. The radius of this circle is the distance from the axis of revolution to the point on the generating circle at angle v, which is R + r cos v. So for each v, the radius of the tangent circle is r_tangent = R + r cos v. For the first configuration, cos v = 3/4, so r_i = 6 + 3*(3/4) = 6 + 9/4 = 33/4. For the second configuration, cos v = -3/7, so r_o = 6 + 3*(-3/7) = 6 - 9/7 = (42/7) - (9/7) = 33/7. The difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 33*(7 - 4)/(4*7) = 33*3/28 = 99/28. Since 99 and 28 share no common factors (99 = 9*11, 28 = 4*7), the fraction is in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 99 and n = 28, and m + n = 127.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent vPr2:\n127\n\n### Sub-task 3: Validate the computed tangent circle radii r_i and r_o by checking geometric feasibility and consistency with the problem statement. Confirm that the torus positions corresponding to h and the tangent circles correspond to external tangency without intersection.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius r) around an axis at distance 6 (major radius R). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus at angle v is the radius of the cross-sectional circle at that v, which is the distance from the axis of revolution to the point on the generating circle at angle v, given by r_tangent = R + r cos v. For the first configuration, cos v = 3/4, so r_i = 6 + 3*(3/4) = 6 + 9/4 = 33/4. For the second configuration, cos v = -3/7, so r_o = 6 + 3*(-3/7) = 6 - 9/7 = 33/7. The difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 33*(7 - 4)/(4*7) = 99/28. Since 99 and 28 share no common factors, the fraction is in lowest terms. To validate geometric feasibility, note that the torus positions correspond to external tangency because the vertical shifts h are such that the torus just touches the sphere externally along these circles without intersection. The tangent circles are distinct because the radii 33/4 and 33/7 differ, and the corresponding angles v differ, confirming two distinct tangent circles. The difference 99/28 matches the expected value from the problem\'s geometric constraints. Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o = 99/28 is correct and consistent with the problem statement.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent IVCA:\n127\n\n### Sub-task 1: Finalize simplified fraction m/n for r_i - r_o. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent TAG4:\nThe torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius r = 3) around an axis 6 units away (major radius R = 6). The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along two distinct circles on the torus with radii r_i and r_o. The radius of a circle on the torus at an angle v on the generating circle is given by r_tangent = R + r*cos(v). The two tangent configurations correspond to angles v where cos(v) = 3/4 and cos(v) = -3/7. Calculating the radii: r_i = 6 + 3*(3/4) = 6 + 9/4 = 33/4 and r_o = 6 + 3*(-3/7) = 6 - 9/7 = 33/7. The difference is r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 33*(7 - 4)/(4*7) = 99/28. Since 99 and 28 have no common factors, the fraction is in lowest terms.

The sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Tangency along a circle means the distance from the origin to points on the torus circle equals 11, and the surfaces are tangent, leading to two equations: (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121 and (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v. From the second, h = 6 tan v. Substituting into the first and simplifying yields two solutions for cos v: 3/4 and -3/7. Corresponding h values are 2 sqrt(7) and -4 sqrt(10). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is R + r cos v = 6 + 3 cos v. For cos v = 3/4, r_i = 33/4; for cos v = -3/7, r_o = 33/7. The difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 99/28, which is in lowest terms. Summing numerator and denominator gives 99 + 28 = 127. All steps are consistent with the problem's geometric setup and tangency conditions, confirming the final answer.; answer - The difference r_i - r_o = 99/28, and the sum m + n = 127.", agents="CoT agent d7Uw, deriving parametric equations with vertical shift h, thinking: The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, with the center of the circle at a distance 6 from the axis.

This means the sphere and torus normals at those points are parallel.\n\nThe sphere normal at point (x,y,z) is the vector from the origin to (x,y,z), i.e., (x,y,z).\n\nThe torus normal at (x,y,z) can be derived from the implicit equation of the torus or from the parametric form. But since the torus is formed by revolving a circle, the normal vector at (u,v) points radially outward from the center of the generating circle at height h.\n\nThe center of the generating circle at angle u is at:\n\nC(u) = (6 cos u, 6 sin u, h)\n\nThe vector from C(u) to the point on the torus is:\n\nP(u,v) - C(u) = (3 cos v cos u, 3 cos v sin u, 3 sin v)\n\nThis vector is the minor radius vector and is normal to the torus surface at that point.\n\nTherefore, the torus normal vector N_t is proportional to:\n\nN_t = (3 cos v cos u, 3 cos v sin u, 3 sin v)\n\nThe sphere normal vector N_s is proportional to:\n\nN_s = (x, y, z) = ((6 + 3 cos v) cos u, (6 + 3 cos v) sin u, h + 3 sin v)\n\nFor tangency, these normals must be parallel:\n\nN_t = k N_s for some scalar k > 0\n\nComparing components:\n\n3 cos v cos u = k (6 + 3 cos v) cos u\n\n3 cos v sin u = k (6 + 3 cos v) sin u\n\n3 sin v = k (h + 3 sin v)\n\nFrom the first two equations (assuming cos u and sin u not both zero),\n\n3 cos v = k (6 + 3 cos v)\n\nFrom the third,\n\n3 sin v = k (h + 3 sin v)\n\nFrom the first,\n\nk = 3 cos v / (6 + 3 cos v) = cos v / (2 + cos v)\n\nFrom the third,\n\nk = 3 sin v / (h + 3 sin v)\n\nEquate these two expressions for k:\n\ncos v / (2 + cos v) = 3 sin v / (h + 3 sin v)\n\nCross multiply:\n\ncos v (h + 3 sin v) = 3 sin v (2 + cos v)\n\nExpand:\n\nh cos v + 3 cos v sin v = 6 sin v + 3 sin v cos v\n\nNote that 3 cos v sin v appears on both sides and cancel out:\n\nh cos v = 6 sin v\n\nTherefore,\n\nh = 6 tan v\n\nStep 4: Substitute h = 6 tan v into the distance equation:\n\n(6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121\n\nReplace h:\n\n(6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (6 tan v + 3 sin v)^2 = 121\n\nNote that 6 tan v + 3 sin v = 6 (sin v / cos v) + 3 sin v = sin v (6 / cos v + 3)\n\nBut better to expand directly:\n\n(6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (6 tan v + 3 sin v)^2 = 121\n\nThis equation in v determines the possible tangent circles for given h.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Distance squared from origin to torus point: D^2 = (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2\n- Tangency requires D = 11\n- Normal vectors parallel implies h = 6 tan v\n- Substitute h into distance condition gives an equation in v.\n\nThese two equations characterize all possible external tangent configurations between the torus and sphere along circles parameterized by v with vertical shift h.; answer: The distance squared from the origin to a point on the torus is D^2 = (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2. External tangency requires D = 11, so (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121. The torus normal and sphere normal are parallel at tangency, giving h = 6 tan v.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius r) around an axis at distance 6 (major radius R). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus at angle v is the radius of the cross-sectional circle at that v, which is simply the minor radius r = 3. However, the problem states the tangent circle has radius r_i or r_o, which corresponds to the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus surface. The radius of this circle is the distance from the axis of revolution to the point on the generating circle at angle v, which is R + r cos v. So for each v, the radius of the tangent circle is r_tangent = R + r cos v. For the first configuration, cos v = 3/4, so r_i = 6 + 3*(3/4) = 6 + 9/4 = 33/4. For the second configuration, cos v = -3/7, so r_o = 6 + 3*(-3/7) = 6 - 9/7 = (42/7) - (9/7) = 33/7. The difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 33*(7 - 4)/(4*7) = 33*3/28 = 99/28. Since 99 and 28 share no common factors (99 = 9*11, 28 = 4*7), the fraction is in lowest terms.

To validate geometric feasibility, note that the torus positions correspond to external tangency because the vertical shifts h are such that the torus just touches the sphere externally along these circles without intersection. The tangent circles are distinct because the radii 33/4 and 33/7 differ, and the corresponding angles v differ, confirming two distinct tangent circles. The difference 99/28 matches the expected value from the problem's geometric constraints.

The computed radii are r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/7, and their difference is correctly simplified to 99/28. The reasoning about external tangency and distinct tangent circles is sound and consistent with the problem statement. However, the final answer given as 127 is incorrect. The problem asks for m + n where the difference is m/n = 99/28, so m + n = 99 + 28 = 127. This matches the final answer, so the final numeric answer is correct.

The sphere has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along two distinct circles with radii r_i and r_o on the torus. The radius of a circle on the torus at angle v on the generating circle is given by r_tangent = R + r*cos(v). The two tangent configurations correspond to angles v where cos(v) = 3/4 and cos(v) = -3/7. Thus, r_i = 6 + 3*(3/4) = 6 + 9/4 = 33/4 and r_o = 6 + 3*(-3/7) = 6 - 9/7 = 33/7.

The torus is vertically shifted by h and parametrized by angles u and v. The torus points are given by x = (6 + 3 cos v) cos u, y = (6 + 3 cos v) sin u, z = h + 3 sin v. The sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Tangency along a circle means the distance from the origin to points on the torus circle equals 11, and the surfaces are tangent, leading to two equations: (6 + 3 cos v)^2 + (h + 3 sin v)^2 = 121 and (h + 3 sin v) cos v = (6 + 3 cos v) sin v. From the second, h = 6 tan v. Substituting into the first and simplifying yields two solutions for cos v: 3/4 and -3/7. Corresponding h values are 2 sqrt(7) and -4 sqrt(10). The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is R + r cos v = 6 + 3 cos v. For cos v = 3/4, r_i = 33/4; for cos v = -3/7, r_o = 33/7.
