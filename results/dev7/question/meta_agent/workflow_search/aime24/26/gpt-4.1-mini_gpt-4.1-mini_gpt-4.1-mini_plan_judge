Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_26
proposed answer: We have found that the total number of sets B is given by the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1} = 2024. To find A, we expressed 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two. The binary representation of 2024 is 111111001000, which corresponds to bits set at positions 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3 (counting from 0 at the right). Each bit position corresponds to a = bit position + 1, so A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. We verify the sum of 2^{a-1} for these elements: 2^{3} + 2^{5} + 2^{6} + 2^{7} + 2^{8} + 2^{9} + 2^{10} = 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2024, confirming correctness. Finally, we compute the sum of elements in A: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
