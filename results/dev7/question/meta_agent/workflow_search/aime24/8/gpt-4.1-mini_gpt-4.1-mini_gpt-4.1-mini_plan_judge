Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 2, we have the classification of positions as winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move, with the base case state(0) = L. The recurrence is: state(n) = W if state(n-1) = L or (n >= 4 and state(n-4) = L), else L. Computing the first few values, we find the losing positions for n=1 to 10 are at n=2,5,7,10. Observing the pattern modulo 5, losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or 2. This pattern repeats every 5 numbers. To count the losing positions up to 2024, we count numbers n ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. The count of numbers ≤ 2024 divisible by 5 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The count of numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5 is also 405 (since 5*404 + 2 = 2022 ≤ 2024). Therefore, total losing positions = 404 + 405 = 809. These losing positions correspond to initial positions where Alice is at a losing state, so Bob can guarantee a win. Hence, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is 809. This reasoning is efficient and verified by the periodicity of the pattern modulo 5.
