On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gaEE', content='From Sub-task 2, we have the classification of positions as winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move, with the base case state(0) = L. The recurrence is: state(n) = W if state(n-1) = L or (n >= 4 and state(n-4) = L), else L. Computing the first few values, we find the losing positions for n=1 to 10 are at n=2,5,7,10. Observing the pattern modulo 5, losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or 2. This pattern repeats every 5 numbers. To count the losing positions up to 2024, we count numbers n ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. The count of numbers ≤ 2024 divisible by 5 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The count of numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5 is also 405 (since 5*404 + 2 = 2022 ≤ 2024). Therefore, total losing positions = 404 + 405 = 809. These losing positions correspond to initial positions where Alice is at a losing state, so Bob can guarantee a win. Hence, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is 809.

We compute state(n) for n=1 to 2024. Starting from base cases: state(0)=L, state(1)=W (since state(0)=L), state(2)=L (state(1)=W and state(-2) invalid), state(3)=W (state(2)=L), state(4)=W (state(0)=L). Continuing this pattern, we find that the losing positions (L) occur periodically every 5 tokens. More specifically, the losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 2. This is because the pattern of L and W states repeats every 5 steps due to the allowed moves of 1 or 4 tokens. To verify, check small values: n=2 is L, n=7 is L, n=12 is L, confirming the pattern. Therefore, all n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2 are losing positions for Alice, meaning Bob can guarantee a win. The total count of such n is the number of positive integers ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5. The smallest is 2, the largest ≤ 2024 with n mod 5=2 is 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2).

For n ≥ 1, state(n) is winning (W) if state(n-1) or state(n-4) is losing (L); otherwise losing (L). We compute state(n) for n=1 to 2024. Starting from n=0: L. Then n=1: state(0) = L, so state(1) = W. n=2: state(1) = W, no state(-2), so state(2) = L (all moves lead to W). n=3: state(2) = L, so state(3) = W. n=4: state(3) = W, state(0) = L, so state(4) = W. Continuing this pattern, we find the sequence of states. Observing the pattern for the first few values: n: state(n) 0:L 1:W 2:L 3:W 4:W 5:W 6:L 7:W 8:L 9:W 10:W 11:W 12:L ... We notice losing positions occur at n where state(n) = L. The losing positions seem to follow a pattern. Checking positions modulo 5: losing positions are at n ≡ 2 (mod 5) or n ≡ 6 (mod 5)? Actually, since 6 mod 5 = 1, no. Let's list losing positions found: 0, 2, 6, 8, 12... Wait, 6 is losing, 8 is losing, 12 is losing. Let's check modulo 5 for these losing positions: 0 mod 5 = 0 (losing), 2 mod 5 = 2 (losing), 6 mod 5 = 1 (losing), 8 mod 5 = 3 (losing), 12 mod 5 = 2 (losing). This is inconsistent. Let's check carefully the states for n=0 to 14: n:state 0:L 1:W (because 0=L) 2:L (1=W) 3:W (2=L) 4:W (0=L) 5:W (1=L? no 1=W, so both moves lead to W? moves: 5-1=4(W), 5-4=1(W), both W, so 5=L) Correction: 5=L 6:W (5=L) 7:L (6=W and 3=W) moves from 7: 7-1=6(W), 7-4=3(W), both W, so 7=L) 8:W (7=L) 9:L (8=W, 5=L) moves: 9-1=8(W), 9-4=5(L), since 5=L, 9=W, so 9=W correction needed. 9: W 10:W (9=W, 6=W) moves: both W, so 10=L correction needed. 10: L 11:W (10=L) 12:L (11=W, 8=W) moves: both W, so 12=L correct 13:W (12=L) 14:L (13=W, 10=L) moves: 14-1=13(W), 14-4=10(L), since 10=L, 14=W correction needed. 14: W So we see the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12. Let's check the pattern of losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12. Differences: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2. The pattern alternates between +2 and +3. So losing positions are at n where n mod 5 is 0 or 2. Confirmed by checking: 0 mod 5=0, 2 mod 5=2, 5 mod 5=0, 7 mod 5=2, 10 mod 5=0, 12 mod 5=2. So losing positions are those with n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Since the initial position is losing for Alice if n mod 5 = 0 or 2, Bob has a winning strategy for these n. Now, counting how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 0 or 2. The numbers n mod 5=0 are multiples of 5: 5,10,15,... up to 2024. The numbers n mod 5=2 are numbers of the form 5k+2. Number of multiples of 5 ≤ 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404. Number of numbers n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5=2: numbers of form 5k+2 ≤ 2024, max k satisfies 5k+2 ≤ 2024 => 5k ≤ 2022 => k ≤ 404. So k=0 to 404, total 405 numbers.

The losing positions up to 10 are n=2,5,7,10. Observing the pattern, losing positions appear periodically every 5 numbers at n mod 5 = 2 or 0 (since 0 is losing at n=0). Checking further confirms that losing positions occur at n mod 5 = 2 or 0. Since the game allows removing 1 or 4 tokens, the losing positions form a pattern with period 5. Therefore, for n ≤ 2024, losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 2 or n mod 5 = 0. Counting these: numbers ≤ 2024 divisible by 5 are floor(2024/5) = 404; numbers ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 mod 5 are also 404 (since the sequence 2,7,12,...). Total losing positions = 404 + 404 = 808.
