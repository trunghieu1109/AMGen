Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To find the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid with exactly four direction changes, we note that each path consists of 16 steps: 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). Exactly four direction changes means the path is divided into 5 runs (segments) alternating between R and U. There are two possible patterns for the runs: starting with R (R-U-R-U-R) or starting with U (U-R-U-R-U).

For the pattern starting with R:
- There are 3 runs of R and 2 runs of U.
- The sum of the lengths of the 3 R runs is 8.
- The sum of the lengths of the 2 U runs is 8.
- The number of positive integer compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2) = 21.
- The number of positive integer compositions of 8 into 2 parts is C(7,1) = 7.
- Total run-length assignments for this pattern = 21 * 7 = 147.

For the pattern starting with U:
- There are 3 runs of U and 2 runs of R.
- The sum of the lengths of the 3 U runs is 8.
- The sum of the lengths of the 2 R runs is 8.
- Number of compositions for 3 parts (U runs) is 21.
- Number of compositions for 2 parts (R runs) is 7.
- Total run-length assignments for this pattern = 21 * 7 = 147.

Each run-length assignment corresponds to exactly one unique path because the steps within each run are identical and consecutive, and the order of runs is fixed by the alternating pattern.

Therefore, total number of paths with exactly four direction changes = 147 + 147 = 294.

This result is consistent and accounts for all possible paths starting with either R or U and having exactly four direction changes.
