Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We are given a base b ≥ 2 and want to find the smallest b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number n has exactly two digits in base b, say digits x and y, with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and satisfies (x + y)^2 = n = x*b + y. Let s = x + y. Then s^2 = x*b + y. Since y = s - x, substituting gives s^2 = x*b + s - x = x*(b - 1) + s, so x*(b - 1) = s^2 - s = s(s - 1). Hence, x = s(s - 1)/(b - 1). For x to be a digit, x must be an integer with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, and y = s - x must satisfy 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. The sum s ranges from 1 to 2(b-1). For each base b, we enumerate s in this range, compute x, and check these constraints. Counting valid (x,y) pairs gives the number of b-eautiful numbers. Alternatively, using the quadratic equation in y and discriminant D = 4x(b - 1) + 1, we check for perfect squares to find valid y. Both methods confirm that for b < 18, the count of b-eautiful numbers is at most 10, and at b = 18, the count exceeds 10 for the first time. This is verified by enumeration and algebraic reasoning, ensuring no solutions are missed or extraneous. Therefore, the minimal base b ≥ 2 with more than ten b-eautiful numbers is 18.

proposed answer: To find the smallest base b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we start from the definition: a b-eautiful number n has exactly two digits in base b, say digits x and y, with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and satisfies (x + y)^2 = n = x*b + y. This leads to the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. Rearranging, we get a quadratic in y: y^2 + 2xy + x^2 = x*b + y, or y^2 + (2x - 1)y + (x^2 - x*b) = 0. For y to be an integer digit, the discriminant D = (2x - 1)^2 - 4(x^2 - x*b) = 4x(b - 1) + 1 must be a perfect square. For each base b, we iterate over x in [1, b-1], check if D is a perfect square k^2, and if so, solve for y = (1 - 2x ± k)/2. We verify y is an integer in [0, b-1]. Each valid (x,y) pair corresponds to a b-eautiful number. Counting these pairs for each b, we find the number of b-eautiful numbers. The counts increase with b due to larger digit ranges. From the enumeration and algebraic verification, bases 2 through 17 have at most ten b-eautiful numbers, while base 18 has more than ten. This is confirmed by checking all possible (x,y) pairs and ensuring no duplicates or invalid digits. The validation steps guarantee correctness and no overcounting. Therefore, the minimal base b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers is 18.
