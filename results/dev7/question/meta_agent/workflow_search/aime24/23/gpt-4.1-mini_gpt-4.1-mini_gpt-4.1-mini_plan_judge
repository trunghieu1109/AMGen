Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We are given a 2x3 grid with digits a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. The conditions are:
1) The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999:
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2) The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Define sums:
S1 = a + d
S2 = b + e
S3 = c + f

From the row sum:
100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999

From the column sum:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let X = a + b + c and Y = d + e + f.
Then 10X + Y = 99.

Also, S1 + S2 + S3 = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = X + Y.

Substitute Y = 99 - 10X into S1 + S2 + S3 = X + Y:
S1 + S2 + S3 = X + 99 - 10X = 99 - 9X.

From the row sum:
S3 = 999 - 100S1 - 10S2

Substitute into S1 + S2 + S3 = 99 - 9X:
S1 + S2 + 999 - 100S1 - 10S2 = 99 - 9X
999 - 99S1 - 9S2 = 99 - 9X

Rearranged:
900 - 99S1 - 9S2 = -9X
Divide by -9:
-100 + 11S1 + S2 = X

Since digits are 0 to 9, sums S1, S2, S3 range from 0 to 18.

Try S1 = 9:
X = 11*9 + S2 - 100 = 99 + S2 - 100 = S2 - 1
X ≥ 0 implies S2 ≥ 1

From S3 = 999 - 100*9 - 10*S2 = 99 - 10*S2
S3 must be between 0 and 18:
0 ≤ 99 - 10*S2 ≤ 18
=> 81 ≤ 10*S2 ≤ 99
=> 8.1 ≤ S2 ≤ 9.9

So S2 = 9
Then S3 = 99 - 90 = 9

Calculate X:
X = S2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
Calculate Y:
Y = 99 - 10X = 99 - 80 = 19

Recall:
S1 = a + d = 9
S2 = b + e = 9
S3 = c + f = 9

X = a + b + c = 8
Y = d + e + f = 19

From S1, S2, S3:
- d = 9 - a
- e = 9 - b
- f = 9 - c

Sum d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c) = 27 - 8 = 19, consistent.

Digits a,b,c are from 0 to 9, sum to 8.
For each such triple (a,b,c), d,e,f are uniquely determined.

Number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with digits ≤ 9 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Therefore, there are 45 ways to assign digits to the grid satisfying both sum constraints.

This count is complete and consistent with all constraints and the example given.

Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.
