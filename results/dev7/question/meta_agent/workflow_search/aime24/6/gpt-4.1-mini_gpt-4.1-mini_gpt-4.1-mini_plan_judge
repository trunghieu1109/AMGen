Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with edges x, y, z such that the surface area is 54 and volume is 23. The surface area condition is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. The volume condition is xyz = 23. The smallest sphere containing the box must have radius at least half the space diagonal, so r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/2. We want to find the maximum possible space diagonal squared D = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 over all boxes satisfying the constraints, then find r^2 = D/4 and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and finally find p+q.

Assuming symmetry or two edges equal, set x = y = a, z = b. Then the constraints become:
1) Surface area: 2(a^2 + 2ab) = 54 => a^2 + 2ab = 27
2) Volume: a^2 b = 23

From volume, b = 23 / a^2. Substitute into surface area:
a^2 + 2a * (23 / a^2) = 27
=> a^2 + 46 / a = 27
Multiply both sides by a:
a^3 + 46 = 27a
=> a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0

Check for roots: a=2 is a root since 8 - 54 + 46 = 0.
Divide polynomial by (a-2):
a^3 - 27a + 46 = (a-2)(a^2 + 2a - 23)

Solve quadratic a^2 + 2a - 23 = 0:
a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2sqrt(6)

Positive root is a = -1 + 2sqrt(6) ≈ 3.898

Two possible (a, b):
1) a=2, b=23/4=5.75
2) a ≈ 3.898, b = 23 / (3.898)^2 ≈ 1.514

Calculate D = 2a^2 + b^2:
1) For a=2, b=5.75:
D = 2*(2^2) + (5.75)^2 = 2*4 + 33.0625 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16
2) For a ≈ 3.898, b ≈1.514:
D ≈ 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2 ≈ 2*15.19 + 2.29 = 30.38 + 2.29 = 32.67 (approx)

Maximum D is 657/16.

Then r^2 = D/4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.

Check gcd(657,64): 657 factors as 3*3*73, 64 = 2^6, so gcd=1.

Therefore, p=657, q=64, and p+q=721.

This fraction is in lowest terms and consistent with constraints.

Hence, the answer is 721.
