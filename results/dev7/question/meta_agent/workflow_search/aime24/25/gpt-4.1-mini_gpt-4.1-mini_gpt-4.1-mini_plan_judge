proposed answer: Given the problem, we have a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. The hexagon's side length is s. The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. From the geometric properties and vector analysis, the key relation connecting the hexagon's side length s and the triangle's side lengths is the harmonic sum: 1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300. To find s, we calculate the right-hand side sum. The least common denominator of 200, 240, and 300 is 1200. Converting each term: 1/200 = 6/1200, 1/240 = 5/1200, and 1/300 = 4/1200. Adding these gives (6 + 5 + 4)/1200 = 15/1200 = 1/80. Therefore, 1/s = 1/80, which implies s = 80. This value satisfies the geometric conditions of the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions. The solution is unique because the harmonic sum relation directly relates s to the given triangle side lengths under the problem's constraints. Hence, the side length of the hexagon is 80.
