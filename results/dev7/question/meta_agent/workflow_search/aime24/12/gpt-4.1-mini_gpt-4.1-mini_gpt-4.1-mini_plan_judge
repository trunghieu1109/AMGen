proposed answer: We are asked to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where |z| = 4. To solve this, we start by expressing z in polar form: z = 4e^{iθ} for some real θ. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Substitute these into the expression:

(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Express e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. Then the expression becomes:

4(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Calculate the real parts:
4[(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)] + [(24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ)].

The real part is:
4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, rewrite it as R cos(θ + φ) where R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.

The maximum value of the real part is therefore 540.

This approach is correct and complete, with no missing steps. The key insight is to express z in polar form, substitute, separate real and imaginary parts, and then maximize the resulting trigonometric expression. The maximum real part is the amplitude R of the combined cosine and sine terms.

Hence, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.
