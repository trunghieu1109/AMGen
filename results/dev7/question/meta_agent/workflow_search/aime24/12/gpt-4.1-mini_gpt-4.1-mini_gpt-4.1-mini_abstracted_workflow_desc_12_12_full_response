To solve this, we start by expressing z in polar form: z = 4e^{iθ} for some real θ. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Substitute these into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.\n\nExpress e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

The key insight is to express z in polar form, substitute, separate real and imaginary parts, and then maximize the resulting trigonometric expression. The maximum real part is the amplitude R of the combined cosine and sine terms.\n\nHence, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.; answer: 540\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent ggIC, feedback: The solution correctly transforms the problem by expressing z in polar form and substituting into the given expression.
