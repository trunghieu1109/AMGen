Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given the values a = log2(x) = -7/24, b = log2(y) = -3/8, and c = log2(z) = -5/12. We need to compute the absolute value of 4a + 3b + 2c, which corresponds to |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Step 1: Calculate each term:
4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6
3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Step 2: Sum these values:
4a + 3b + 2c = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Step 3: Find a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.
Convert each fraction:
-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

Sum = (-28/24) + (-27/24) + (-20/24) = (-75/24)

Step 4: Take the absolute value:
| -75/24 | = 75/24

Step 5: Simplify the fraction 75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
75 รท 3 = 25
24 รท 3 = 8

So, 75/24 simplifies to 25/8.

Step 6: The fraction is now in lowest terms with m = 25 and n = 8. We need to find m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Therefore, the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8, and the sum m + n is 33.
