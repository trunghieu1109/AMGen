Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We start with the inradius expressed as the fraction 272/2024. To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 272 and 2024. The prime factorization of 272 is 2^4 * 17 (since 272 = 16 * 17). The prime factorization of 2024 is 2^3 * 11 * 23 (since 2024 = 8 * 11 * 23). The common factors are 2^3 = 8. Dividing numerator and denominator by 8, we get 272 รท 8 = 34 and 2024 รท 8 = 253. So the simplified fraction is 34/253. Next, we check if 34 and 253 share any common factors. 34 factors as 2 * 17, and 253 factors as 11 * 23, so they have no common factors. Therefore, 34/253 is in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where the inradius is m/n = 34/253. Hence, m + n = 34 + 253 = 287. This is the final answer.

proposed answer: The inradius of triangle ABC was found to be 384/5. To finalize the fraction simplification, we check the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 384 and 5. Since 5 is a prime number and does not divide 384, the GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction 384/5 is already in simplest form with m = 384 and n = 5. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 384 + 5 = 389. This confirms the fraction is simplified correctly and the arithmetic sum is accurate.
