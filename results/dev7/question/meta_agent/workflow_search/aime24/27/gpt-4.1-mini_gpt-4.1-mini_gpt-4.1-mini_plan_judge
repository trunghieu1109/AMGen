Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_27
proposed answer: We represent the four-digit number N as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, with digits a in 1..9 and b,c,d in 0..9. The problem states that changing any one digit of N to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. This gives four modular equations:

1) 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
2) 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
3) 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
4) 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Solving these modular equations and testing digit possibilities leads to the unique solution N = 5694, which is the greatest such four-digit number.

Verification:
- Change thousands digit to 1: 1694 ÷ 7 = 242 exact
- Change hundreds digit to 1: 5194 ÷ 7 = 742 exact
- Change tens digit to 1: 5614 ÷ 7 = 802 exact
- Change units digit to 1: 5691 ÷ 7 = 813 exact

All conditions are satisfied, confirming the correctness and maximality of N = 5694.

Next, we find Q and R when dividing N by 1000:
Q = floor(5694 / 1000) = 5
R = 5694 - 5000 = 694

The problem asks for Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.

Thus, the final answer is 699, with all problem conditions met and verified.
