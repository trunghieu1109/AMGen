Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: We are given a list of positive integers with the following properties: the sum of the items is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The median being a positive integer not in the list implies the list length is even, and the median is the average of two middle numbers that differ by 2 (so the median itself is not in the list). The mode 9 must appear more times than any other number, so at least twice. We try to find such a list. One valid list is [5, 7, 9, 9]. This list sums to 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, the mode is 9 (appearing twice), and the median is (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list. This satisfies all conditions. Now, we calculate the sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. No other list satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the valid list is 236.
