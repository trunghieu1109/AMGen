Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_9_15
proposed answer: We are given four items: Diamond ring (D), Golf clubs (G), Garden spade (S), and Candy hearts (C). All 900 residents own candy hearts, so every resident owns at least one item (C). The problem states: - Number owning exactly two items = 437 - Number owning exactly three items = 234 - Total residents = 900 - Number owning diamond ring = 195 - Number owning golf clubs = 367 - Number owning garden spade = 562 We want to find the number of residents owning all four items (D, G, S, and C). Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly one item means owning only candy hearts. Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items. Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other items. Owning exactly four items means owning all four items. Define variables: x1 = number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts), x2 = number owning exactly two items, x3 = number owning exactly three items, x4 = number owning exactly four items. Given: x2 = 437, x3 = 234, total residents = 900, so: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900 (1) We want to find x4. Let d2, d3, d4 be number owning exactly two, three, and four items including diamond ring; similarly g2, g3, g4 for golf clubs, and s2, s3, s4 for garden spade. Since owning all four items includes all three plus candy hearts, x4 = d4 = g4 = s4. The total owning diamond ring is d2 + d3 + x4 = 195; similarly for golf clubs: g2 + g3 + x4 = 367; garden spade: s2 + s3 + x4 = 562. The total owning exactly two items is d2 + g2 + s2 = 437, and exactly three items is d3 + g3 + s3 = 234. Summing the three totals: (d2 + d3 + x4) + (g2 + g3 + x4) + (s2 + s3 + x4) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 Group terms: (d2 + g2 + s2) + (d3 + g3 + s3) + 3x4 = 1124 Substitute known sums: 437 + 234 + 3x4 = 1124 => 671 + 3x4 = 1124 => 3x4 = 453 => x4 = 151 From (1): x1 + 437 + 234 + 151 = 900 => x1 = 900 - 822 = 78 Check totals: 78 + 437 + 234 + 151 = 900, consistent. Check item totals: For diamond ring: d2 + d3 + 151 = 195; similarly for others. The calculations are consistent with given data and assumptions. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 151.

Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_9_15
proposed answer: Step 1: Restate the problem and given data.
- Total residents: 900.
- Items: Diamond ring (D), Golf clubs (G), Garden spade (S), Candy hearts (C).
- All 900 residents own candy hearts (C).
- Number owning D: 195, G: 367, S: 562.
- Number owning exactly two items: 437.
- Number owning exactly three items: 234.
- Goal: Find the number owning all four items (D, G, S, C).

Step 2: Understand the meaning of 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' items.
Since all residents own candy hearts, every resident owns at least one item (C).
- Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items (D, G, or S).
- Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items.
- Owning all four items means owning candy hearts plus all three other items.

Step 3: Use the relationship between the total counts of D, G, and S and the counts of residents owning exactly two, three, and four items.
- Each resident owning exactly two items contributes 1 to the sum |D| + |G| + |S| (since they own candy hearts plus one other item).
- Each resident owning exactly three items contributes 2 to the sum (candy hearts plus two items).
- Each resident owning all four items contributes 3 to the sum (candy hearts plus all three items).

Step 4: Write the equation:
|D| + |G| + |S| = (number owning exactly two) * 1 + (number owning exactly three) * 2 + (number owning all four) * 3

Step 5: Substitute known values:
195 + 367 + 562 = 437 + 2*234 + 3*c
1124 = 437 + 468 + 3c
1124 = 905 + 3c
3c = 219
c = 73

Step 6: Verify consistency with total residents and ownership counts.
- Total residents = 900.
- Number owning exactly two items = 437.
- Number owning exactly three items = 234.
- Number owning all four items = 73.

Step 7: Check if these numbers are plausible.
- The sum of residents owning exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items is 437 + 234 + 73 = 744.
- Since all residents own candy hearts, the remaining 900 - 744 = 156 residents own exactly one item (which must be candy hearts only, but since candy hearts are owned by all, owning only candy hearts means owning exactly one item).

Step 8: Confirm no contradictions.
- The numbers add up correctly.
- The interpretation that candy hearts are owned by all residents simplifies the problem.
- The assumption that 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' items include candy hearts is consistent and necessary.

Step 9: Lessons learned.
- Clarifying assumptions is critical, especially when one item is universally owned.
- Inclusion-exclusion principles and careful counting of intersections are essential in combinatorial problems.
- Verifying the sum of all categories against the total population ensures consistency.

Final conclusion: The number of residents owning all four items is 73, consistent with all given data and assumptions.

Answer:The number of residents owning all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts) is 73.
