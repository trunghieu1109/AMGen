The given numbers are: 195 own diamond rings, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own garden spades, and all 900 own candy hearts. Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. The problem states that all residents own candy hearts, so the set C includes all 900 residents. However, it is ambiguous whether the counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts or only the other three items. This ambiguity is important because candy hearts are universally owned, so any subset of items owned must include candy hearts. Without making assumptions, we summarize the data as given, highlighting the universal ownership of candy hearts and the ambiguity about the counts of exactly two and three items. This summary prepares the data for further analysis and problem-solving steps.; answer - Total residents: 900\nNumber owning diamond rings (D): 195\nNumber owning golf clubs (G): 367\nNumber owning garden spades (S): 562\nNumber owning candy hearts (C): 900 (all residents)\nNumber owning exactly two of these items: 437\nNumber owning exactly three of these items: 234\nNote: It is ambiguous whether the counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts or only the other three items. This ambiguity is important because candy hearts are owned by all residents, so any subset of items owned must include candy hearts. No assumptions are made about this in this summary.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Given that all 900 residents own candy hearts (C), every resident owns at least one item, candy hearts. We are asked to find the number of residents owning all four items (D, G, S, and C). The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these items and 234 own exactly three. We assume that these counts include candy hearts as one of the items. Define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one, exactly two, and exactly three of the three items (D, G, S) as a, b, and c respectively. Since all residents own candy hearts, the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one of (D, G, S) plus those owning exactly two plus those owning exactly three plus those owning none of these three (only candy hearts). Let d be the number owning none of the three (only candy hearts). Then a + b + c + d = 900. The problem states that 437 own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three items. Since these counts include candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, and owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items. Therefore, the number owning exactly two items (including candy hearts) corresponds to a = 437, and the number owning exactly three items corresponds to b = 234. The number owning all four items (candy hearts plus all three of D, G, S) is c, which we want to find. The sum of the sizes of D, G, and S is |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Using the formula |D| + |G| + |S| = a + 2b + 3c, substituting known values: 1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3c => 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3c => 1124 = 905 + 3c => 3c = 219 => c = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items. This approach correctly incorporates the universal ownership of candy hearts and the counts of exactly two and three items including candy hearts as one of the items. The number of residents owning all four items is 73.; answer - 73\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We are asked to analyze the system assuming that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts, i.e., these counts only consider the three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S). Since all 900 residents own candy hearts (C), candy hearts is universal and does not affect the counts of exactly two or three items if we exclude it.\n\nDefine variables for the numbers of residents owning exactly certain combinations of D, G, and S (excluding C, which everyone owns):\n\nLet:\nx = number owning exactly D only\ny = number owning exactly G only\nz = number owning exactly S only\na = number owning exactly D and G only\nb = number owning exactly G and S only\nc = number owning exactly D and S only\nd = number owning exactly D, G, and S\n\nGiven:\n- Number owning exactly two items (excluding candy hearts) = 437, so a + b + c = 437.\n- Number owning exactly three items (excluding candy hearts) = 234, so d = 234.\n\nAlso, the total number owning each item (including candy hearts) is given:\n- D: 195\n- G: 367\n- S: 562\n\nExpress total owners of D, G, S in terms of variables:\n- D owners = x + a + c + d = 195\n- G owners = y + a + b + d = 367\n- S owners = z + b + c + d = 562\n\nTotal residents = 900 = x + y + z + a + b + c + d\n\nFrom above:\n- a + b + c = 437\n- d = 234\n\nSubstitute d and a+b+c into the total:\n x + y + z + 437 + 234 = 900\n => x + y + z = 900 - 671 = 229\n\nFrom the D owners equation:\n x + a + c + d = 195\n => x + (a + c) + 234 = 195\n => x + (a + c) = 195 - 234 = -39 (impossible)\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the assumption that exactly two and exactly three counts exclude candy hearts leads to an impossible or contradictory system.\n\nComparing with the assumption that these counts include candy hearts, the equations were more consistent. Thus, excluding candy hearts from these counts leads to contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the system of equations under the assumption that exactly two and exactly three counts exclude candy hearts is:\n- a + b + c = 437\n- d = 234\n- x + y + z = 229\n- x + a + c + d = 195\n- y + a + b + d = 367\n- z + b + c + d = 562\n- x + y + z + a + b + c + d = 900\n\nBut this system is inconsistent (as shown by negative values), indicating the assumption is invalid or leads to contradictions.\n\nHence, the structure of these equations is similar to those including candy hearts but leads to contradictions, highlighting the importance of the interpretation of exactly two and exactly three counts in the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, assuming the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts results in an inconsistent system of equations, making this assumption invalid. The more consistent and correct approach is to include candy hearts in these counts.; answer - Assuming that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts leads to an inconsistent and contradictory system of equations, making this assumption invalid. Therefore, the most consistent and correct solution is that these counts must include candy hearts, and excluding candy hearts from these counts is not logically consistent with the given data.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We analyze the problem under two assumptions regarding whether the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items include or exclude candy hearts (C), which all residents own.\n\nAssumption 1: Counts include candy hearts.\n- Total residents: 900.\n- Items: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade), C (candy hearts).\n- All own candy hearts, so everyone owns at least one item.\n- Given: Exactly two items owned = 437, exactly three items owned = 234.\n\nDefine:\n- a = number of residents owning exactly two items including candy hearts.\n- b = number of residents owning exactly three items including candy hearts.\n- c = number owning all four items (D, G, S, C).\n- Since all own candy hearts, owning exactly two items means candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, or S.\n- Owning exactly three items means candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S.\n- Owning all four means candy hearts + D + G + S.\n\nSum of owners of D, G, S is |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nUsing the formula for sum of owners:\n|D| + |G| + |S| = a + 2b + 3c.\n\nGiven a = 437, b = 234, so:\n1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3c\n1124 = 437 + 468 + 3c\n1124 = 905 + 3c\n3c = 219\nc = 73.\n\nTherefore, 73 residents own all four items.\n\nAssumption 2: Counts exclude candy hearts.\n- Here, exactly two and exactly three counts refer only to D, G, S.\n- Let x, y, z be numbers owning exactly one of D, G, S respectively.\n- Let a, b, c be numbers owning exactly two of D, G, S pairs.\n- Let d be number owning all three D, G, S.\n\nGiven:\n- a + b + c = 437 (exactly two of D, G, S)\n- d = 234 (exactly three of D, G, S)\n- Total owners of D = x + a + c + d = 195\n- Total owners of G = y + a + b + d = 367\n- Total owners of S = z + b + c + d = 562\n- Total residents = x + y + z + a + b + c + d = 900\n\nSubstitute a + b + c = 437 and d = 234 into total:\n x + y + z + 437 + 234 = 900\n x + y + z = 229\n\nFrom D owners:\n x + a + c + 234 = 195\n x + a + c = -39 (impossible, negative)\n\nThis contradiction shows the assumption excluding candy hearts leads to inconsistency.\n\nConclusion:\n- Under assumption including candy hearts, number owning all four items is 73.\n- Under assumption excluding candy hearts, the system is inconsistent, no valid solution.\n\nHence, the consistent and valid solution is that 73 residents own all four items.; answer - The system of equations under the assumption that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts is consistent and yields the number of residents owning all four items as 73.

Let d be the number owning none of the three (only candy hearts). Then a + b + c + d = 900. The problem states that 437 own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three items. Since these counts include candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, and owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items. But this conflicts with the usual meaning of \'exactly two items\' because candy hearts is owned by all. Therefore, the problem likely means the counts of exactly two and exactly three items refer to the sets D, G, and S only, excluding candy hearts. So, a is the number owning exactly one of D, G, S; b is the number owning exactly two of D, G, S; c is the number owning exactly three of D, G, S. Since all own candy hearts, the total number of residents is a + b + c + d = 900, where d is the number owning none of D, G, S. Given that exactly two items owned is 437 and exactly three items owned is 234, then b = 437 and c = 234. The total number owning at least one of D, G, S is a + b + c = 900 - d. The sum of the sizes of D, G, and S is equal to a + 2b + 3c (since those owning exactly one contribute 1, exactly two contribute 2, exactly three contribute 3). Using the given numbers: |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 = a + 2*437 + 3*234 = a + 874 + 702 = a + 1576. Therefore, a + 1576 = 1124 => a = 1124 - 1576 = -452, which is impossible. This contradiction suggests that the counts of exactly two and exactly three items do not exclude candy hearts but include it. Reconsidering, if exactly two items include candy hearts, then owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S. Define x = number owning exactly one of D, G, S; y = number owning exactly two of D, G, S; and z = number owning all three D, G, S. Then: Number owning exactly two items (including candy hearts) = x (since candy hearts + one other), so x = 437. Number owning exactly three items (including candy hearts) = y (candy hearts + two others), so y = 234. Number owning all four items (candy hearts + all three) = z = ?. The sum of the sizes of D, G, and S is |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Using the formula |D| + |G| + |S| = x + 2y + 3z, substituting known values: 1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3z => 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3z => 1124 = 905 + 3z => 3z = 1124 - 905 = 219 => z = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items. This approach correctly incorporates the universal ownership of candy hearts and the counts of exactly two and three items including candy hearts as one of the items. The number of residents owning all four items is 73.; answer: 73\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent KC69, analyzing counts including candy hearts, thinking: We are given that all 900 residents own candy hearts (C). We consider the three other items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S). We define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one, exactly two, and exactly three of these three items (D, G, S) as a, b, and c respectively. Since every resident owns candy hearts, owning exactly one of the four items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, similarly for exactly two and three items. The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of the four items, and 234 own exactly three of the four items. These counts include candy hearts as one of the items owned. So, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items (because candy hearts is always owned), and owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items. Therefore, the number of residents owning exactly two items is equal to the number owning exactly one of D, G, S (a = 437), and the number owning exactly three items is equal to the number owning exactly two of D, G, S (b = 234). The number owning exactly four items (all four) corresponds to those owning candy hearts plus all three of D, G, S (c). The number owning exactly one of the four items (only candy hearts) corresponds to those owning candy hearts but none of D, G, S (d). We know total residents = a + b + c + d = 900. We also know the sums of owners of each item: 195 own D, 367 own G, 562 own S. The total sum of owners of D, G, S is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Using the principle that the sum of the sizes of the sets D, G, S equals a + 2b + 3c, where a, b, c are the counts of residents owning exactly one, two, and three of these items respectively, we have: a + 2b + 3c = 1124. We have a = 437, b = 234, so substituting: 437 + 2*234 + 3c = 1124 => 437 + 468 + 3c = 1124 => 905 + 3c = 1124 => 3c = 219 => c = 73. Therefore, the number of residents owning all three of D, G, S (and candy hearts) is 73. This means 73 residents own all four items. The number owning exactly one of D, G, S is 437, and exactly two is 234. The number owning none of D, G, S (only candy hearts) is d = 900 - (a + b + c) = 900 - (437 + 234 + 73) = 156. This setup and calculation prepare the system of equations and solve for the number of residents owning all four items.; answer: 73\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent p083, analyzing counts including candy hearts, thinking: Given that all 900 residents own candy hearts (C), and assuming that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts as one of the items, we analyze the ownership of the other three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S). Define variables:\n- a = number of residents owning exactly one of the three items (D, G, S)\n- b = number of residents owning exactly two of the three items\n- c = number of residents owning exactly three of the three items\n\nSince all residents own candy hearts, the total number of items owned by each resident is the number of these three items they own plus one (for candy hearts). Thus:\n- Residents owning exactly one item total must own candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S → total items owned = 2\n- Residents owning exactly two items total must own candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S → total items owned = 3\n- Residents owning exactly three items total must own candy hearts plus all three of D, G, S → total items owned = 4\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Number owning exactly two items total = 437 → these are residents who own candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S → b = 437\n- Number owning exactly three items total = 234 → these are residents who own candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S → c = 234\n\nNumber owning all four items (candy hearts + D + G + S) corresponds to residents owning candy hearts plus all three of D, G, S, which is the count of residents owning exactly three of the three items plus those owning all four. But since residents owning exactly three items total correspond to candy hearts plus exactly two of the three items, the count of residents owning all four items is the number owning candy hearts plus all three items, which we can denote as d.\n\nLet d = number of residents owning all four items.\n\nTotal residents = 900 = (number owning exactly one of D,G,S) + (number owning exactly two of D,G,S) + (number owning exactly three of D,G,S) + (number owning none of D,G,S)\n\nBut everyone owns candy hearts, so:\n- Residents owning exactly one item (total) = residents owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D,G,S = a\n- Residents owning exactly two items (total) = residents owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D,G,S = b = 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items (total) = residents owning candy hearts plus exactly three of D,G,S = c = 234\n\nSince the problem states 234 residents own exactly three of these things, and we have b = 437 and c = 234, the number owning all four is the number owning candy hearts plus all three items, which is c = 234.\n\nBut this conflicts with the assumption that \'exactly three\' includes candy hearts plus exactly two items. Therefore, the number owning all four items is the number owning candy hearts plus all three items, which is the count of residents owning all four items.\n\nHence, the number of residents owning all four items is 234.\n\nTo summarize:\n- a + b + c + number owning none of D,G,S = 900\n- From the problem, exactly two items (total) = 437 → corresponds to candy hearts plus exactly one of D,G,S → a = 437\n- Exactly three items (total) = 234 → corresponds to candy hearts plus exactly two of D,G,S → b = 234\n- Number owning all four items (candy hearts + D + G + S) = c\n\nSum of sizes of D, G, S = a + 2b + 3c\n\nGiven the numbers:\n- D = 195\n- G = 367\n- S = 562\n\nSum of sizes = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nPlugging in:\n1124 = a + 2b + 3c\n\nWe have a = 437, b = 234, so:\n1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3c\n1124 = 437 + 468 + 3c\n1124 = 905 + 3c\n3c = 1124 - 905 = 219\nc = 73\n\nTherefore, the number of residents owning all four items (c) is 73.; answer: 73\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Xdz8, analyzing counts excluding candy hearts, thinking: We are asked to analyze the situation assuming that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts, meaning these counts only consider the three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S).

This highlights the importance of correctly interpreting the counts in the original problem.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent vqEo, analyzing counts excluding candy hearts, thinking: Given the problem, we have four items: Diamond ring (D), Golf clubs (G), Garden spade (S), and Candy hearts (C). All 900 residents own candy hearts (C). We are asked to assume that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts, i.e., these counts only consider the three items D, G, and S. Let us define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one, two, or three of these three items (D, G, S):\n\n- Let x1 = number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S.\n- Let x2 = number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S.\n- Let x3 = number of residents owning exactly three of D, G, S.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- Number owning exactly two items (excluding candy hearts) = 437\n- Number owning exactly three items (excluding candy hearts) = 234\n\nSince all residents own candy hearts, the total 900 residents are partitioned into those owning:\n- None of D, G, S (only candy hearts)\n- Exactly one of D, G, S\n- Exactly two of D, G, S\n- Exactly three of D, G, S\n\nWe know the counts for exactly two and exactly three from the problem (437 and 234 respectively).\n\nDefine variables for the number owning exactly one of D, G, S as x1, and the number owning none of D, G, S as x0.\n\nThe total residents:\n\nx0 + x1 + x2 + x3 = 900\n\nGiven:\nx2 = 437\nx3 = 234\n\nSo:\nx0 + x1 + 437 + 234 = 900\n=> x0 + x1 = 900 - 671 = 229\n\nAlso, from the individual counts of D, G, S:\n- Number owning D = 195\n- Number owning G = 367\n- Number owning S = 562\n\nWe can express these in terms of x1, x2, x3. For example, the total number owning D is:\n- Those owning exactly D only (part of x1)\n- Those owning D and one other (part of x2)\n- Those owning all three (x3)\n\nLet us define variables for the exact number owning each combination:\n\n- a = number owning only D\n- b = number owning only G\n- c = number owning only S\n- d = number owning D and G only\n- e = number owning D and S only\n- f = number owning G and S only\n- g = number owning D, G, S (all three)\n\nFrom the problem:\n- a + d + e + g = 195 (D owners)\n- b + d + f + g = 367 (G owners)\n- c + e + f + g = 562 (S owners)\n\nAlso:\n- a + b + c = x1 (exactly one)\n- d + e + f = x2 = 437 (exactly two)\n- g = x3 = 234 (exactly three)\n\nFrom these, we have:\n- a + b + c = x1\n- d + e + f = 437\n- g = 234\n\nTotal:\n- a + b + c + d + e + f + g + x0 = 900\n- x0 + x1 + 437 + 234 = 900\n- x0 + x1 = 229\n\nWe have 7 variables (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) plus x0 and x1 (but x1 = a+b+c), so effectively 8 variables.\n\nEquations:\n1) a + d + e + g = 195\n2) b + d + f + g = 367\n3) c + e + f + g = 562\n4) a + b + c = x1\n5) d + e + f = 437\n6) g = 234\n7) x0 + x1 = 229\n\nThese can be used to solve for the variables and understand the structure.\n\nComparing to Sub-task 2, where the counts of exactly two and exactly three items included candy hearts, the main difference is that here candy hearts are excluded, simplifying the problem to the three items D, G, and S. This avoids the ambiguity of universal ownership and allows direct set intersection analysis among three sets. The system is more straightforward, focusing on the three items only.\n\nIn conclusion, under the assumption that exactly two and exactly three counts exclude candy hearts, we have set up variables for the exact ownership combinations and formed a system of linear equations representing the problem. This system can be solved to find the distribution of ownership among the residents. The structure is simpler and more consistent than including candy hearts in the counts, as candy hearts are universally owned and do not add complexity in this assumption.; answer: Define variables a,b,c,d,e,f,g as the number of residents owning exactly one or two or three of the items D,G,S as follows: a,b,c for exactly one item (D,G,S respectively), d,e,f for exactly two items (D&G, D&S, G&S respectively), and g for exactly three items (D,G,S). Given the counts of exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts, we have d+e+f=437 and g=234. The individual ownership counts give three equations: a+d+e+g=195, b+d+f+g=367, c+e+f+g=562. Also, a+b+c=x1 (exactly one item), and total residents satisfy x0+x1+437+234=900, where x0 is residents owning none of D,G,S. This system of equations is consistent and simpler than the case where candy hearts are included in the counts, as it excludes the universal ownership complexity and focuses solely on D,G,S ownership combinations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yIw4, analyzing counts excluding candy hearts, thinking: Given that all 900 residents own candy hearts (C), and the counts of exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts, we focus only on the three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S). Define variables for the number of residents owning exactly two and exactly three of these three items, excluding candy hearts. Let x = number owning exactly two of these items among D, G, S, and y = number owning exactly three of these items among D, G, S. From the problem, we have x = 437 and y = 234, under the assumption that these counts exclude candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the total number of residents owning exactly two items including candy hearts would be different, but here we only consider D, G, S. Also, define variables for the number owning each item exclusively and in intersections. Using inclusion-exclusion principles, we can set up equations for the totals of each item: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. The sum of those owning exactly one item plus those owning exactly two items plus those owning exactly three items equals 900 (total residents), since everyone owns candy hearts. We can write the system: Let a = number owning exactly one of D,G,S; x = number owning exactly two of D,G,S = 437; y = number owning exactly three of D,G,S = 234. Then a + x + y = 900. But since x + y = 437 + 234 = 671, a = 900 - 671 = 229. Next, the sum of the sizes of the sets equals sum of those owning exactly one item plus twice those owning exactly two plus thrice those owning exactly three: |D| + |G| + |S| = a + 2x + 3y. Plugging values: 195 + 367 + 562 = 229 + 2*437 + 3*234. Calculate left: 1124. Calculate right: 229 + 874 + 702 = 1805. The two sides do not match, indicating inconsistency or that the assumption that exactly two and exactly three counts exclude candy hearts is invalid. This suggests that the counts of exactly two and exactly three items must include candy hearts. Thus, the structure of the equations under the assumption that exactly two and exactly three counts exclude candy hearts leads to contradictions, differing from the situation where these counts include candy hearts. Therefore, the assumption is logically inconsistent with the given data. This comparison shows the importance of including candy hearts in the counts for exactly two and exactly three items.; answer: Assuming that the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items exclude candy hearts (considering only diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade), we define variables for those owning exactly one, two, and three of these three items. Using inclusion-exclusion, we find that the sum of the sizes of the sets (195 + 367 + 562 = 1124) must equal the sum of those owning exactly one item plus twice those owning exactly two plus thrice those owning exactly three. Given exactly two = 437 and exactly three = 234, this implies: 1124 = a + 2*437 + 3*234 = a + 874 + 702 = a + 1576, which is impossible because a would be negative. Also, the total number of residents owning exactly one, two, or three items must be 900, so a + 437 + 234 = 900 => a = 229. The inconsistency indicates that the assumption that \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' counts exclude candy hearts is invalid. Compared to the assumption that these counts include candy hearts, this assumption leads to contradictions and is not logically consistent with the data. Therefore, the system of equations under this assumption cannot be satisfied, highlighting the importance of including candy hearts in the counts of exactly two and exactly three items.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Mw4S, solving systems and comparing results, thinking: We analyze the problem under two assumptions about the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items: including candy hearts and excluding candy hearts.\n\nAssumption 1: Counts include candy hearts.\n- Total residents = 900.\n- Everyone owns candy hearts (C).\n- Number owning diamond ring (D) = 195.\n- Number owning golf clubs (G) = 367.\n- Number owning garden spade (S) = 562.\n- Number owning exactly two items = 437.\n- Number owning exactly three items = 234.\n\nSince everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items (D, G, S), and owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of these items.
