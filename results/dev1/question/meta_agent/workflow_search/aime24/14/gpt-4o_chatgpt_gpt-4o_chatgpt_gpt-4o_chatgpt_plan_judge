Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than BD^2 for rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and intersect at the origin. The length of diagonal BD is given by \( 2\sqrt{20 \sec^2(\theta_2) + 24 \tan^2(\theta_2)} \). Thus, BD^2 = \( 4(20 \sec^2(\theta_2) + 24 \tan^2(\theta_2)) \). To maximize this, we analyze the function \( 20 \sec^2(\theta_2) + 24 \tan^2(\theta_2) \). Using trigonometric identities, \( \sec^2(\theta_2) = 1 + \tan^2(\theta_2) \), we have \( 20(1 + \tan^2(\theta_2)) + 24 \tan^2(\theta_2) = 20 + 44 \tan^2(\theta_2) \). This function increases with \( \tan^2(\theta_2) \), and the maximum occurs when \( \tan^2(\theta_2) \to \infty \), which is not feasible. Therefore, we need to find the highest finite value of \( \tan^2(\theta_2) \) that satisfies the hyperbola equation. The hyperbola equation implies that \( x^2 \to 20 \) and \( y^2 \to 24 \), leading to the largest possible value for \( \tan^2(\theta_2) \). By substituting these maximum values, we find that \( BD^2 = 4(20 + 44 \times 1.2) = 4(20 + 52.8) = 4 \times 72.8 = 291.2 \). The greatest real number less than BD^2 is therefore 291.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than BD² for a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The expression for BD² was derived as \(BD^2 = 4(20 + 24\sinh^2(s))\). Since \(\sinh^2(s)\) can take any non-negative value, the smallest value occurs when \(s = 0\), giving \(BD^2 = 80\). As \(s\) increases, \(BD^2\) increases without bound. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is slightly less than 80, as 80 is the value approached but never exceeded. Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² is 80.
