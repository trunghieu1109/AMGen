Specifically, the product of \\( P(x) \\) evaluated at all 13th roots of unity is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) raised to the power of the degree of the other polynomial, but in this case, we need to consider the specific form of \\( P(x) \\) and how it interacts with the roots of unity. The product can be simplified using the fact that the sum of the roots of unity is zero, and the product of the roots of unity is \\( (-1)^{13-1} = -1 \\). Therefore, the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) is equal to \\( P(1)^{13} = 1^{13} = 1 \\). However, this reasoning is incorrect because it does not properly account for the interaction of the polynomial with the roots of unity. The correct approach involves recognizing that the polynomial \\( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) evaluated at the 13th roots of unity is related to the cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\), and the product should be calculated using the properties of these polynomials. The product is actually related to the constant term of the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) raised to the power of the degree of the cyclotomic polynomial, but the specific calculation needs to be done carefully considering the structure of the polynomial and the roots of unity. After evaluating the product and simplifying, the numeric value of the product is determined to be 8192.; answer: 8192\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, calculating numeric value, thinking: The product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) is evaluated at the 13th roots of unity. The polynomial \\( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) can be rewritten as \\( (x-1)^2 + 1 \\). The product of \\( P(x) \\) evaluated at all 13th roots of unity \\( \\omega^k \\) is related to the resultant of \\( P(x) \\) and \\( x^{13} - 1 \\). Since \\( \\omega^k \\) are the roots of \\( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \\), the product is equal to the constant term of \\( P(x) \\) raised to the power of the degree of the cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\), which is 12. The constant term of \\( P(x) \\) is 2, so the product is \\( 2^{13} = 8192 \\). However, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. Calculating \\( 8192 \\mod 1000 \\) gives 192. Therefore, the correct numeric value of the product, considering the remainder, is 192.; answer: 192\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Bd5P, finding remainder modulo 1000, thinking: The numeric value obtained from Sub-task 5 is 192. The question in Sub-task 6 asks for the remainder when this value is divided by 1000. Since 192 is less than 1000, the remainder when 192 is divided by 1000 is simply 192 itself. Therefore, the remainder is 192.; answer: 192\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent seif, finding remainder modulo 1000, thinking: The numeric value of the product from Sub-task 5 is 8192, and the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000 has already been calculated as 192. Therefore, the remainder of the product when divided by 1000 is 192.; answer: 192\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent NTHV, finding remainder modulo 1000, thinking: The numeric value from Sub-task 5 is 192. Since we are asked to find the remainder when this value is divided by 1000, we calculate 192 mod 1000. Since 192 is less than 1000, the remainder is simply 192 itself.; answer: 192", iteration_idx=-1)]
