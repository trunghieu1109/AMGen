Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes her to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. The time taken to walk a certain distance is given by the formula: time = distance/speed. Therefore, the time taken to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is 9/3 = 3 hours. Since the problem asks for the total time including the time spent in the coffee shop, we need to add the 24 minutes she spends there. Therefore, the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes. Converting 3 hours into minutes gives us 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

The distance she walks is 9 kilometers. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of s kilometers per hour is given by the formula: time = distance/speed. Therefore, the time taken to walk is 9/s hours. Since the total time including the coffee shop is 4 hours, and she spends t minutes in the coffee shop, we convert t minutes to hours (t/60 hours) and set up the equation: 9/s + t/60 = 4.; answer - 9/s + t/60 = 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In the second scenario, Aya walks at a speed of s+2 kilometers per hour. The total distance she walks is 9 kilometers. The total time for the walk, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is 2 hours and 24 minutes. We need to convert 2 hours and 24 minutes into hours, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. The time spent walking is the total time minus the time spent in the coffee shop, which is t minutes or t/60 hours. Therefore, the time spent walking is 2.4 - t/60 hours. The time spent walking is also equal to the distance divided by the speed, which is 9/(s+2) hours.
