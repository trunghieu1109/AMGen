For k = 0, the expression evaluates to 1. For k = 1 to 12, we have (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0. The product of all non-trivial 13th roots of unity (ω^1 to ω^12) is -1. Therefore, the product of (1 - ω^k) for k = 1 to 12 is the same as the product of (1 - ω^k) for k = 1 to 12, which is a known result related to cyclotomic polynomials. The product of (1 - ω^k) for k = 1 to 12 is 13, as it is the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1. Therefore, the product of (1 - ω^k)^2 for k = 1 to 12 is 13^2. Each term (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1 is a real number, and the product of these terms is a real number. The product of (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1 for k = 1 to 12 is 2^12, as each term is 2. Therefore, the product of all terms is 1 * 2^12 = 4096. The remainder when 4096 is divided by 1000 is 96.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZBaz:\n96\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Determine the remainder of the computed product when divided by 1000, using modular arithmetic techniques.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

We need to evaluate this expression for each k from 0 to 12. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1. For each k, ω^k is also a 13th root of unity. Let's evaluate the expression for each k:\n\n1.
