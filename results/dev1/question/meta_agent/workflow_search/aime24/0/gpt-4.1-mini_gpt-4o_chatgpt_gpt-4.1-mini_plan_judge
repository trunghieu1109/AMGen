Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_0
proposed answer: The numeric value from Sub-task 5 is 192. Since we are asked to find the remainder when this value is divided by 1000, we calculate 192 mod 1000. Since 192 is less than 1000, the remainder is simply 192 itself.

Answer:192
Extracted answer: 192
Correct answer: 321
