Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 7, we determined that the conditional probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. In this fraction, m = 1 and n = 115. The problem asks us to find m + n, which is simply 1 + 115. Therefore, m + n = 116.

proposed answer: The conditional probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is calculated as P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize and B is the event of winning a prize. From the sub-tasks, we have P(A) = 1/210 and P(B) = 23/42. Since winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, P(A and B) = P(A) = 1/210. Thus, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form, with m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 1 + 115 = 116. Both agents agree on this result, and the calculations are consistent with the given probabilities.
