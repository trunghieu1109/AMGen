Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent Y041', content='The conditional probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is calculated as P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize and B is the event of winning a prize.

The number of ways to choose 2 matching numbers from 4 is C(4, 2) = 6, and the number of ways to choose 2 non-matching numbers from the remaining 6 is C(6, 2) = 15. Thus, there are 6 * 15 = 90 ways.\n\n2) If Jen matches exactly 3 numbers: She picks 3 numbers from the 4 chosen, and the remaining 1 number must be picked from the 6 numbers not chosen. The number of ways to choose 3 matching numbers from 4 is C(4, 3) = 4, and the number of ways to choose 1 non-matching number from the remaining 6 is C(6, 1) = 6. Thus, there are 4 * 6 = 24 ways.\n\n3) If Jen matches all 4 numbers: She picks all 4 numbers from the 4 chosen.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} is given by the combination C(10, 4). This is the total number of possible outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes, as calculated in Sub-task 2, is 115, which is the number of ways Jen can win a prize by having at least 2 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. Therefore, the probability of Jen winning a prize is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, which is 115 / C(10, 4). Calculating C(10, 4), we have C(10, 4) = 210. Thus, the probability is 115 / 210.
