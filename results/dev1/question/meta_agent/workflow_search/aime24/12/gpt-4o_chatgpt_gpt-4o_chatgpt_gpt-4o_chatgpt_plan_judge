Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: To find the maximum real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4, we first express z in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}. The expression becomes 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ). We found that the maximum value of this expression is 540, which occurs when θ = -atan2(-432, 324). Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.
