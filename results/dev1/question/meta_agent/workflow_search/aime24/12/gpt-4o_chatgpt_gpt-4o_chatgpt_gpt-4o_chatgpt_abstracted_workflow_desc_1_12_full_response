However, the limitation is that it does not directly address how to find the maximum real part, which is the original problem's goal. The expression 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ) is a linear combination of cos(θ) and sin(θ), and to find its maximum value, one would typically use the method of finding the amplitude of the resulting sinusoidal function. This involves recognizing that the expression can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is a phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is R, which can be found using R = sqrt((324)^2 + (-432)^2).

The coefficient R can be found using the formula R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where a = 324 and b = -432. Calculating R gives R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.

The expression can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is R. The amplitude R can be found using the formula R = √(a² + b²), where a and b are the coefficients of cos(θ) and sin(θ), respectively. In this case, a = 324 and b = -432. Thus, R = √(324² + (-432)²) = √(104976 + 186624) = √291600 = 540. The maximum value occurs when cos(θ + φ) = 1, which happens when θ + φ = 0.
