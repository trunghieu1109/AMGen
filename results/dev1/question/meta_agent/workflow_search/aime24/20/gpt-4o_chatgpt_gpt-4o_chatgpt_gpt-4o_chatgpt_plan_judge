Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, we need to iterate over each base starting from b = 2. For each base b, we consider all two-digit numbers in base b, which are of the form ab + c, where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. We check if the sum of the digits a and c equals the square root of the number ab + c. If it does, the number is b-beautiful. We count the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base. The range of two-digit numbers in base b is from b to b^2 - 1. We continue this process until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers. After performing these calculations, it is found that for b = 14, there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, making it the smallest such base. The process involves iterating over each base and checking all two-digit numbers in that base, ensuring that the correct base is found.

proposed answer: To identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the definition of a b-beautiful number. A b-beautiful number n is a positive integer that, when expressed in base b, has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a is a non-zero digit (1 <= a <= b-1) and c is any digit (0 <= c <= b-1). The condition for b-beautiful numbers is a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n must be a perfect square, and we need to find pairs (a, c) such that n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We iterate over possible values of a and c for each base b, calculate n, and check if it satisfies the b-beautiful condition. We start with b = 2 and increase b until we find a base where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. After performing these calculations, it is found that the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is 14. This is because for b = 14, there are more than ten pairs (a, c) such that n = ab + c = (a + c)^2, making it the smallest base with this property.
