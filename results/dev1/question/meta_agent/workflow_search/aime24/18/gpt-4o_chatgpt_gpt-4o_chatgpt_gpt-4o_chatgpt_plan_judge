Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we determined that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of p and q, which is 1 + 4.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the coordinates of point C on segment AB, which is distinct from A and B, and does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of C were found to be \((1/4, \sqrt{3}/4)\). To find \(OC^2\), we use the distance formula from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/4, \sqrt{3}/4). The square of the distance is \(OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/4)^2\). Simplifying, \((1/4)^2 = 1/16\) and \((\sqrt{3}/4)^2 = 3/16\). Adding these values gives \(OC^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4\). This fraction is already in simplest form where \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), and they are relatively prime. Therefore, \(OC^2 = 1/4\), and \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\). The correct answer is 5.
