Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_19
proposed answer: Both agents have correctly identified that the simplified product is 169. Since 169 is less than 1000, the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000 is simply 169 itself. This is because when a number is divided by a larger number, the remainder is the number itself. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 169.

Answer:169
Extracted answer: 169
Correct answer: 321

proposed answer: Both agents have correctly identified that the simplified product is 8192. To find the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000, we look at the last three digits of 8192, which are 192. This is because dividing by 1000 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 192. Therefore, the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000 is indeed 192.

Answer:The remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 192.
