Thus, the values of m, n, and p are correctly identified as 6, 2, and 5, respectively.; answer: m = 6, n = 2, p = 5\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent qjmX, calculating m+n+p, thinking: From the previous sub-task, we have identified the values of m, n, and p as 6, 2, and 5, respectively. The task now is to calculate the sum of these values. Therefore, we compute m + n + p = 6 + 2 + 5. This results in a sum of 13. The values of m, n, and p were determined based on the expression for the inradius of the tetrahedron, which was given as 6\\sqrt{2} / 5, and these values satisfy the conditions that m and p are relatively prime and n is not divisible by the square of any prime.; answer: 13", iteration_idx=-1)]
