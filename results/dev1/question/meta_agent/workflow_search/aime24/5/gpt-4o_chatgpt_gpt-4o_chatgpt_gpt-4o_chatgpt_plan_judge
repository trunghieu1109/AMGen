Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The inradius of the tetrahedron is given in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 5 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 8 \). These values were determined by simplifying the expression for the inradius, which was calculated as \( \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{8} \). The sum \( m + n + p \) is therefore \( 5 + 2 + 8 = 15 \). This matches the previous sub-task's conclusion, confirming the correctness of the values for \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \).

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have identified the values of m, n, and p as 6, 2, and 5, respectively. The task now is to calculate the sum of these values. Therefore, we compute m + n + p = 6 + 2 + 5. This results in a sum of 13. The values of m, n, and p were determined based on the expression for the inradius of the tetrahedron, which was given as 6\sqrt{2} / 5, and these values satisfy the conditions that m and p are relatively prime and n is not divisible by the square of any prime.

proposed answer: The inradius of the tetrahedron was calculated as r = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}. To express this in the form \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}, where m and p are relatively prime and n is not divisible by the square of any prime, we identify m = 1, n = 2, and p = 2. This is because \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} can be rewritten as \frac{1 \sqrt{2}}{2}. In this form, m = 1 and p = 2 are relatively prime, and n = 2 is square-free. Therefore, the expression is already in the required form. The sum m + n + p = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

proposed answer: The inradius of the tetrahedron is given as 1 * sqrt(1) / 4, where m = 1, n = 1, and p = 4. These values satisfy the conditions: m and p are relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the sum m + n + p is calculated as 1 + 1 + 4.
