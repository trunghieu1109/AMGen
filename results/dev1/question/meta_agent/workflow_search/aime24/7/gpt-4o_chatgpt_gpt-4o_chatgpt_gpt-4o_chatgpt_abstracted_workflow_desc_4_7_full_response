Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent u8yd', content='To verify the solution, we need to check if the values of x and y that satisfy the condition xy = 25 also satisfy the original logarithmic equations. The original equations are \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). We need to find specific values of x and y such that their product is 25 and they satisfy these equations.

For \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\), we have \\( \\log_5(5^5) = 5 \\), which does not equal 10, so x = 5 and y = 5 do not satisfy the first equation. We need to find other values of x and y.
