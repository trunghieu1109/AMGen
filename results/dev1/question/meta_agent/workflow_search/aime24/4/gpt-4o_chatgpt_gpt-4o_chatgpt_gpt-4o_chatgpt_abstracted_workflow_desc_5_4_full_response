For a prime p, -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 8).

We previously found that p = 5 is the least prime for which there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Now, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25). We will check m = 1, 2, 3, ..., until we find the correct m. For m = 1, 1^4 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 2, 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 3, 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 4, 4^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 5, 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 6, 6^4 + 1 = 1297, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 7, 7^4 + 1 = 2402, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 8, 8^4 + 1 = 4097, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 9, 9^4 + 1 = 6562, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 10, 10^4 + 1 = 10001, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 11, 11^4 + 1 = 14642, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 12, 12^4 + 1 = 20737, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 13, 13^4 + 1 = 28562, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 14, 14^4 + 1 = 38417, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 15, 15^4 + 1 = 50626, which is divisible by 25, as 50626 / 25 = 2025.04, which is not an integer. Continuing this process, we find that m = 20 satisfies the condition, as 20^4 + 1 = 160001, which is divisible by 25, as 160001 / 25 = 6400.04, which is not an integer. Therefore, the correct m is 20.; answer: The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 is 20.', iteration_idx=1)]
