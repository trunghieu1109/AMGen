Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the total number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. From the related sub-task, two specific sequences were evaluated: R^1 U^3 R^3 U^3 R^1 and R^2 U^2 R^4 U^2 R^2. The number of valid paths for these sequences was calculated as 1120 and 420, respectively. Since these are the only sequences provided and evaluated in the sub-task, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is the sum of the valid paths for these sequences: 1120 + 420 = 1540. Therefore, the final decision on the total number of paths is 1540.

proposed answer: To find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid, we need to consider the two patterns of direction changes: RURUR and URURU. For each pattern, we calculate the number of unique paths by considering the partitions of horizontal and vertical moves. For RURUR, we partition the horizontal moves (R) into three segments (x1, x2, x3) such that x1 + x2 + x3 = 8, and the vertical moves (U) into two segments (y1, y2) such that y1 + y2 = 8. The number of ways to arrange these segments is given by the multinomial coefficient, calculated as 8! / (x1! x2! x3!) for horizontal and 8! / (y1! y2!) for vertical. We sum the number of paths for all valid partitions. Similarly, for URURU, we partition the horizontal moves into two segments and the vertical moves into three segments, and again sum the number of paths for all valid partitions. Finally, the total number of paths is the sum of the results from both patterns, accounting for all possible partitions that result in exactly four changes in direction. The total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is the sum of the paths calculated for the RURUR and URURU patterns based on their respective partitions.

Answer:The total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is the sum of the paths calculated for the RURUR and URURU patterns based on their respective partitions.
