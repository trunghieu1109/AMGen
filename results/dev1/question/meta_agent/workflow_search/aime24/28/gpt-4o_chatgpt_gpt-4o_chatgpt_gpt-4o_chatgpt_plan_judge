Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have the difference r_i - r_o expressed as the fraction 5/1, where m = 5 and n = 1. The problem asks for the sum m + n. Since m = 5 and n = 1, we calculate m + n = 5 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the sum m + n is 6.

proposed answer: The difference r_i - r_o was calculated as 2\sqrt{7}. To express this as a fraction in simplest form, we need to rationalize it. The correct way to express 2\sqrt{7} as a fraction with integers is to multiply by \sqrt{7}/\sqrt{7}, giving \frac{2\times 7}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{14}{\sqrt{7}}. Rationalizing gives \frac{14\sqrt{7}}{7} = 2\sqrt{7}. However, to express it as a fraction with integers, we can write it as \frac{2\sqrt{7}}{1} and multiply by \sqrt{7}/\sqrt{7} to get \frac{2\times 7}{1} = \frac{14}{1}. Therefore, m = 14 and n = 1, and m + n = 14 + 1 = 15.
