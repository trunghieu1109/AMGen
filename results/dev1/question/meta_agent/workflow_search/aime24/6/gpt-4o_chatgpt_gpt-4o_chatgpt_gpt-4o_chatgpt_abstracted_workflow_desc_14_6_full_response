The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half the diagonal of the box. The diagonal is given by d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), so the radius r = d/2, and r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. To find the dimensions x, y, and z, we need to solve the system of equations for the surface area and volume. By solving these equations, we find that the dimensions are x = 2, y = 3, and z = 23/6. Substituting these values back, we calculate x^2 + y^2 + z^2, which gives us 4 + 9 + (23/6)^2. Simplifying this, we find that r^2 = 361/36.

We introduce Lagrange multipliers λ and μ for the constraints g and h, respectively. The Lagrangian is L(x, y, z, λ, μ) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + λ(2(xy + yz + zx) - 54) + μ(xyz - 23). We take partial derivatives and set them to zero: ∂L/∂x = 2x + λ(2y + 2z) + μ(yz) = 0, ∂L/∂y = 2y + λ(2x + 2z) + μ(xz) = 0, ∂L/∂z = 2z + λ(2x + 2y) + μ(xy) = 0, ∂L/∂λ = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0, ∂L/∂μ = xyz - 23 = 0.

Substituting x = 3, y = 3, z = 23/9, we calculate xy = 9, yz = 3 * 23/9 = 23/3, and zx = 3 * 23/9 = 23/3. Therefore, xy + yz + zx = 9 + 23/3 + 23/3 = 9 + 46/3 = 27/3 + 46/3 = 73/3. The surface area is 2 * 73/3 = 146/3, which is not equal to 54. Thus, the surface area constraint is not satisfied. The volume constraint is xyz = 23. Substituting x = 3, y = 3, z = 23/9, we have xyz = 3 * 3 * 23/9 = 23, which satisfies the volume constraint.
