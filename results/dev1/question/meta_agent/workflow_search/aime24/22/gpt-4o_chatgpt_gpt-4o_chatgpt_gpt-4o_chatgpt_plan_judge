Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The constructed list [3, 4, 5, 9, 9] satisfies all the given conditions: 1) The sum of the items is 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 30, which matches the required sum. 2) The unique mode is 9, as it appears twice, more frequently than any other number in the list. 3) The median of the list is the middle element when sorted, which is 5. The sorted list is [3, 4, 5, 9, 9], and the median is indeed 5, which does not appear in the list itself. Therefore, all conditions are satisfied. The sum of the squares of the numbers in the list is calculated as follows: 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 9 + 16 + 25 + 81 + 81 = 212. Thus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is 212.

proposed answer: The list [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9, 1] was found to have a non-unique mode, as both 1 and 9 appear twice. We need a list where 9 is the unique mode, the sum is 30, and the median is not in the list. Let's try [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 9]:
- The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 30.
- The mode is 9, as it appears twice, more than any other number.
- The list has 6 elements, so the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements when sorted, which are 3 and 6, giving a median of 4.5, which is not in the list.
This list satisfies all conditions. Now, calculate the sum of squares: 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 36 + 81 + 81 = 212.
