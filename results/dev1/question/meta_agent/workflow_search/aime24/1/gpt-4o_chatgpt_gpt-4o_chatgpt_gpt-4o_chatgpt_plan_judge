Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we have determined that AP can be expressed as the fraction \( \frac{8}{1} \), where \( m = 8 \) and \( n = 1 \). These values are relatively prime, as their greatest common divisor is 1. To find the sum \( m + n \), we simply add these two numbers together: \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined that AP is expressed as the fraction 45/4, where m = 45 and n = 4. These numbers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of m and n, which is simply 45 + 4.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the length of segment AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle, with given side lengths and using properties of tangents and symmedians. The solution involves calculating the circumradius, using the symmedian length formula, and applying the Power of a Point theorem. The calculations have been verified to be consistent and reasonable, resulting in AP = 45/4. Therefore, m = 45 and n = 4, leading to m + n = 49.
