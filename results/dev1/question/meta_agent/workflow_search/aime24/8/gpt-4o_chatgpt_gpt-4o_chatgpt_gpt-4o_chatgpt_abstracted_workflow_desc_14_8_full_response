Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent LnGJ', content="The analysis provided in the sub-tasks is correct. Bob is in a losing position when n is a multiple of 5 because Alice can always play in such a way that Bob is left with another multiple of 5, eventually leading to Bob's loss. Therefore, for each n from 1 to 2024, we need to classify whether n is a winning or losing position for Bob. If n is a multiple of 5, it is a losing position for Bob. Otherwise, it is a winning position for Bob. To find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we count the numbers that are not multiples of 5. The multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The number of such multiples is given by the largest integer k such that 5k <= 2024, which is k = 404.

A winning position for Bob is one where, no matter what Alice does on her turn, Bob can always respond in a way that eventually leads to his victory. Conversely, a losing position for Bob is one where, if Alice plays optimally, Bob cannot win. To determine these positions, we can use the concept of 'winning' and 'losing' positions in combinatorial game theory. A position is a losing position if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent. A position is a winning position if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent. Since Alice goes first, we need to determine the positions where Bob can force a win. If Alice starts with a losing position, Bob can win by playing optimally. We can analyze small cases: 1 token is a losing position for Bob because Alice can take it and win. 2 tokens is a winning position for Bob because Alice can only take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a losing position for Alice. Similarly, 3 tokens is a winning position for Bob. 4 tokens is a winning position for Bob because Alice can take 1 or 4 tokens, and in both cases, Bob can win. 5 tokens is a losing position for Bob because Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 token, which is a losing position for Bob. By continuing this analysis, we can find a pattern: positions that are multiples of 5 are losing positions for Bob, and all other positions are winning positions for Bob. Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win if the number of tokens is not a multiple of 5.; answer - The winning positions for Bob are those where the number of tokens is not a multiple of 5.

We start by analyzing the smallest values of n:\n\n- For n = 1, Alice can take the 1 token and win, so this is a losing position for Bob.\n- For n = 2, Alice can only take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a losing position for Alice. Therefore, n = 2 is a winning position for Bob.\n- For n = 3, Alice can only take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, n = 3 is a winning position for Bob.\n- For n = 4, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 3 tokens for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob, or she can take all 4 tokens and win.

To develop a strategy for larger n, we can generalize this observation: Bob can guarantee a win if he can force Alice into a losing position. Since the losing positions are multiples of 5, Bob's strategy would be to always leave Alice with a number of tokens that is a multiple of 5. This means that for any n that is not a multiple of 5, Bob can always adjust his play (by taking 1 or 4 tokens) to make the remaining tokens a multiple of 5 after Alice's turn. Thus, Bob can guarantee a win for any n that is not a multiple of 5.

From the base cases, we observed that n = 1 and n = 5 are losing positions for Bob, while n = 2, 3, and 4 are winning positions. This suggests a pattern where every multiple of 5 (i.e., n = 5, 10, 15, ...) is a losing position for Bob, while any other number is a winning position for Bob. This pattern can be understood by considering that if Bob is faced with a position that is a multiple of 5, Alice can always play optimally to force Bob back into another multiple of 5 on his turn. Conversely, if Bob is not faced with a multiple of 5, he can play optimally to leave Alice with a multiple of 5 on her turn. Thus, for any n that is not a multiple of 5, Bob can guarantee a win by playing optimally. Therefore, the strategy for larger n is for Bob to always aim to leave Alice with a multiple of 5. Since n = 2024, we need to count the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are not multiples of 5. There are 2024 integers total, and the multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The number of multiples of 5 is 2020/5 = 404.
