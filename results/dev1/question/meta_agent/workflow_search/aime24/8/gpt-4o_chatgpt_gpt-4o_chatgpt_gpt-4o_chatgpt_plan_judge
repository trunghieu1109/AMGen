Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To count the number of winning positions for Bob, we need to identify the positions where Bob can guarantee a win. From the strategy, we know that Bob loses if n is of the form 5k or 5k + 2. Therefore, these are the losing positions for Bob. For every 5 consecutive numbers, 2 are losing positions (those that are 0 or 2 mod 5), and 3 are winning positions for Bob. Since there are 2024 numbers in total, we calculate the number of losing positions as 2/5 of 2024, which is 809.6. Since we are dealing with integers, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 810 losing positions. The number of winning positions is then 2024 - 810 = 1214. Therefore, the number of winning positions for Bob is 1214.

proposed answer: The analysis provided in the sub-tasks is correct. Bob is in a losing position when n is a multiple of 5 because Alice can always play in such a way that Bob is left with another multiple of 5, eventually leading to Bob's loss. Therefore, for each n from 1 to 2024, we need to classify whether n is a winning or losing position for Bob. If n is a multiple of 5, it is a losing position for Bob. Otherwise, it is a winning position for Bob. To find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we count the numbers that are not multiples of 5. The multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The number of such multiples is given by the largest integer k such that 5k <= 2024, which is k = 404. Therefore, there are 404 losing positions for Bob. Since there are 2024 total positions, the number of winning positions for Bob is 2024 - 404 = 1620.

Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_8
proposed answer: In the game, a position is winning for Bob if it is losing for Alice. From the previous sub-task, we know that the number of losing positions for Bob (which are winning for Alice) is 1012. Since there are 2024 total positions (from 1 to 2024), the number of winning positions for Bob is the total number of positions minus the number of losing positions for Bob. Therefore, the number of winning positions for Bob is 2024 - 1012.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_8
proposed answer: To find the number of winning positions for Bob, we need to subtract the number of losing positions for Bob from the total number of positions up to 2024. From Sub-task 5, we know that there are 672 losing positions for Bob. The total number of positions is 2024. Therefore, the number of winning positions for Bob is 2024 - 672.
