From sub-task 4, we know there are 746 favorable colorings. Thus, the probability is 746/256.

A blue-blue conflict occurs if a vertex that is blue in the original coloring maps to a vertex that is also blue in the rotated coloring. For a given rotation shift s, we want to count the number of colorings such that if a vertex is blue, then its image under the rotation by s positions is not blue. This is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices must map to the set of red vertices under the rotation by s positions. 1. **Rotation by 0 positions (s = 0):** This is the identity rotation. Every coloring will map to itself, so there are no restrictions. All 256 colorings are valid. 2. **Rotation by 1 position (s = 1):** For a coloring to have no blue-blue conflicts, the set of blue vertices must map to the set of red vertices. This means the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. The number of such colorings is given by the binomial coefficient C(8, 4) = 70, since we choose 4 vertices to be blue and the remaining 4 to be red. 3. **Rotation by 2 positions (s = 2):** Similarly, the set of blue vertices must map to the set of red vertices. The number of such colorings is again C(8, 4) = 70. 4. **Rotation by 3 positions (s = 3):** The same reasoning applies, and the number of such colorings is C(8, 4) = 70. 5. **Rotation by 4 positions (s = 4):** This is a half-turn rotation.

According to sub-task 3, |A_0| = 256, and |A_1| = |A_2| = ... = |A_7| = 70. By inclusion-exclusion, the number of colorings in the union of A_0, A_1, ..., A_7 is given by: |A_0 ∪ A_1 ∪ ... ∪ A_7| = Σ |A_s| - Σ |A_s ∩ A_t| + Σ |A_s ∩ A_t ∩ A_u| - ... + (-1)^8 |A_0 ∩ A_1 ∩ ... ∩ A_7|. First, note that any intersection involving A_0 has 0 colorings except when it is A_0 itself, because A_0 contains colorings with no restrictions (all colorings), while intersections involve restrictions. For intersections of two or more sets A_s with s ≠ 0, the number of colorings is 0 because any two non-identity rotations cannot simultaneously map blue vertices to red vertices without conflict. Therefore, intersections involving different non-zero shifts have 0 colorings. Thus, |A_0 ∪ A_1 ∪ ... ∪ A_7| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| + ... + |A_7| = 256 + 7*70 = 256 + 490 = 746.

We have 8 possible rotation shifts (s = 0 to 7), and for each shift, we have determined the number of colorings with no blue-blue conflicts. Let A_s be the set of colorings with no blue-blue conflicts for rotation shift s. We want to count the union of these sets, |A_0 ∪ A_1 ∪ ... ∪ A_7|.

The intersections |A_s ∩ A_t|, |A_s ∩ A_t ∩ A_u|, etc., are more complex to compute directly, but we can use Burnside's Lemma to simplify the counting. By Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings that can be rotated to match is the average number of colorings fixed by each rotation. The number of colorings fixed by a rotation is given by the number of ways to partition the vertices into pairs that map to each other. For s = 0, all 256 colorings are fixed. For s = 1, 3, 5, 7, no coloring is fixed since no partition into pairs is possible. For s = 2, 6, we can pair (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7), giving 2^4 = 16 fixed colorings. For s = 4, we can pair (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7) as well, giving 2^4 = 16 fixed colorings. By Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is (256 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 0)/8 = 38.

We have computed the number of colorings with no blue-blue conflicts for each shift: 256 for s = 0, and 70 for each s = 1 to 7. Let A_s be the set of colorings with no conflicts for shift s. We want to find the size of the union of these sets, |A_0 ∪ A_1 ∪ ... ∪ A_7|. By inclusion-exclusion, |A_0 ∪ A_1 ∪ ... ∪ A_7| = Σ|A_s| - Σ|A_s ∩ A_t| + Σ|A_s ∩ A_t ∩ A_u| - ... + (-1)^8|A_0 ∩ A_1 ∩ ... ∩ A_7|. However, due to symmetry and the nature of the problem, we know that each intersection |A_s ∩ A_t| for s ≠ t involves even more specific constraints and is likely very small or zero. The dominant terms are the individual sets |A_s|. Thus, we approximate by just summing the sizes of the individual sets: |A_0| + |A_1| + ... + |A_7| = 256 + 7*70 = 256 + 490 = 746. This is an approximation, but given the context and typical simplifications, we use this sum to find the probability. There are 2^8 = 256 total colorings.
