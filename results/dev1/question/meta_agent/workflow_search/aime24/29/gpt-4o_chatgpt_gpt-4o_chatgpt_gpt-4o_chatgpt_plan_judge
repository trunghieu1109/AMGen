Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: Both agents agree that there is only 1 valid maximal configuration. The reasoning is that we have a 5x5 grid and need to fill 5 rows with one color (say white) and 5 columns with the other color (say black). Since there are exactly 5 rows and 5 columns, there is only 1 way to choose all 5 rows and 1 way to choose all 5 columns. The intersection of these rows and columns must remain empty to satisfy the condition that all chips in the same row and column have the same color. Therefore, there is only 1 way to achieve this configuration, making the number of valid maximal configurations 1.

proposed answer: The problem involves placing 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips on a 5x5 grid with specific constraints. Each row and column must have chips of the same color, and the configuration must be maximal, meaning no additional chips can be placed without violating the constraints. A maximal configuration occurs when every empty cell is at the intersection of a row and a column of opposite colors. For each configuration, we choose colors for the rows and then determine the compatible column colors. There are 2 choices (white or black) for each of the 5 rows, leading to 2^5 = 32 possible configurations of row colors. For each of these configurations, the column colors are uniquely determined to satisfy the constraints. Therefore, there are 32 distinct maximal configurations that satisfy all the constraints.
