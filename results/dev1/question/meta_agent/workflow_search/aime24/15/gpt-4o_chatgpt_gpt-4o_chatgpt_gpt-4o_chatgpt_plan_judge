Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: To find the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts), we need to consider the information given. We know that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, the residents who own all three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) and also own a bag of candy hearts are the same as those who own all three items, since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. From the sub-task, we know that 234 residents own all three items. Since all residents own a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents also own all four items. Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.

Answer:234
Extracted answer: 234

proposed answer: To verify that the computed values satisfy all problem constraints, we need to check the following: 1) The total number of residents is 900. 2) The number of residents owning exactly one, two, three, or four items should add up to 900. 3) The number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. 4) The number of residents owning all four items is T₄ = 73. 5) The number of residents owning exactly one item is T₁ = 156. We have T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄ = 900, where T₂ = 437 and T₃ = 234. Substituting the known values, we have 156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900, which satisfies the total number of residents. Therefore, the computed values satisfy all problem constraints.

Answer:The computed values satisfy all problem constraints, confirming the solution is correct.
