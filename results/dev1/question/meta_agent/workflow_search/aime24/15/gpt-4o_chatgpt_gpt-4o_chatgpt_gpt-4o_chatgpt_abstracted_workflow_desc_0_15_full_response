Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Let T₁ be the number of residents who own exactly 1 of the items (diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade). Let T₂ be the number of residents who own exactly 2 of these items. Let T₃ be the number of residents who own exactly 3 of these items. Let T₄ be the number of residents who own all 4 items, including the bag of candy hearts. We know from the problem statement that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), so T₂ = 437. Similarly, there are 234 residents who own exactly three of these items, so T₃ = 234. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns a bag of candy hearts, so T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄ = 900. We need to find T₄, the number of residents who own all four items.; answer - T₁: Number of residents owning exactly 1 item, T₂: Number of residents owning exactly 2 items, T₃: Number of residents owning exactly 3 items, T₄: Number of residents owning all 4 items.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We are given that there are 900 residents in total, and each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. We have defined T₁ as the number of residents owning exactly 1 of the items (diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade), T₂ as the number of residents owning exactly 2 of these items, T₃ as the number of residents owning exactly 3 of these items, and T₄ as the number of residents owning all 4 items, including the bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns at least the bag of candy hearts, the sum of T₁, T₂, T₃, and T₄ must equal the total number of residents, which is 900. Therefore, the equation T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄ = 900 correctly represents the total number of residents.; answer - T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄ = 900\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the total number of items owned, we consider the contributions from each group of residents. Residents who own exactly 1 item contribute 1 item each, so they contribute 1·T₁ items in total. Residents who own exactly 2 items contribute 2 items each, so they contribute 2·T₂ items in total. Residents who own exactly 3 items contribute 3 items each, so they contribute 3·T₃ items in total. Residents who own all 4 items contribute 4 items each, so they contribute 4·T₄ items in total. The sum of all these contributions gives the total number of items owned by the residents. Therefore, the equation for the total number of items owned is 1·T₁ + 2·T₂ + 3·T₃ + 4·T₄ = 2024.; answer - 1·T₁ + 2·T₂ + 3·T₃ + 4·T₄ = 2024.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have two equations: T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄ = 900 and 1·T₁ + 2·T₂ + 3·T₃ + 4·T₄ = 2024.

Subtract the first equation from the second: (T₁ + 4·T₄) - (T₁ + T₄) = 448 - 229, which simplifies to 3·T₄ = 219. Solving for T₄, we get T₄ = 73.
