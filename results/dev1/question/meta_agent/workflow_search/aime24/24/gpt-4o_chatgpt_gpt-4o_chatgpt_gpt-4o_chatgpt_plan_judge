Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The sub-task 5 already provided the result of the expression as a fraction 25/8, where 25 and 8 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8. The task is to find the sum m + n, which is 25 + 8. This calculation gives us 33. Since the question asks for m + n, the final answer is 33.
