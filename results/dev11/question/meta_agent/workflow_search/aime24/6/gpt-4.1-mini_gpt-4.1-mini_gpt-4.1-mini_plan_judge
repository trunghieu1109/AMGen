Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the squared radius r^2 of the smallest sphere that can contain all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius r is half the space diagonal d of the box, so r^2 = d^2 / 4. The key is to maximize d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 under the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23. From previous analyses, the maximum d^2 was found to be 657/16. Dividing by 4 gives r^2 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. The fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms since 657 factors as 3^2 * 73 and 64 is 2^6, sharing no common factors. Therefore, p = 657 and q = 64, and p + q = 721. This matches the consistent and verified result from multiple independent attempts, confirming the correctness of the answer.
