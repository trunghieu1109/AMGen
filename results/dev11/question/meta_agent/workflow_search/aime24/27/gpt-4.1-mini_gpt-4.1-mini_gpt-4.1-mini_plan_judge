Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_27
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. After analyzing the modular arithmetic conditions and digit replacements, the number N was determined to be 5694. Dividing 5694 by 1000 gives quotient Q = 5 and remainder R = 694. The problem asks for Q + R, which is 5 + 694 = 699. This satisfies all the problem conditions and is consistent with the decomposition of N into Q and R.
