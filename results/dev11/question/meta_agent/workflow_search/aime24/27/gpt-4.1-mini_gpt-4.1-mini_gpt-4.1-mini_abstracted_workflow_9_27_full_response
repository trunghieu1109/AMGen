Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).\n- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.\n- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and R between 0 and 999.\n- The task is to find Q + R.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- Changing any single digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies a set of divisibility conditions for each digit position.\n- Since N is four-digit, it has digits d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 (thousands to units).\n- For each digit position i, replacing d_i with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.\n- These conditions impose modular arithmetic constraints on N and its digits.\n- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying these constraints, the maximum is sought.\n- Q and R relate to the decomposition of N into thousands and remainder parts, and their sum is the final quantity to find.\n\n3.

Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem is clear in its conditions; however, it assumes understanding of digit replacement and divisibility.\n- Potential challenge: multiple digit replacements and ensuring all resulting numbers are divisible by 7.\n- Assumption: Changing exactly one digit at a time to 1, not multiple digits simultaneously.\n- Assumption: The digits are decimal digits (0–9), and the leading digit is nonzero (since N is four-digit).\n- No ambiguity in Q and R definitions; standard division remainder and quotient.\n\nOverall, the problem requires analyzing modular conditions arising from digit replacements, identifying the greatest four-digit number satisfying these, and then computing Q + R from its division by 1000..These are just pieces of information related to the question.
