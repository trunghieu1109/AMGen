Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_18
proposed answer: The problem involves finding a unique point C on segment AB such that C is not on any other unit segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except AB itself. Points A and B are given as A=(1/2,0) and B=(0,\sqrt{3}/2). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of all unit length segments connecting points on the positive x-axis and y-axis. By parameterizing AB and analyzing the coverage of the first quadrant by these unit segments, the unique point C is found. Two agents concluded that \(OC^2 = \frac{7}{16}\), giving \(p+q=23\), while another agent found \(OC^2 = \frac{9}{16}\), giving \(p+q=25\). The majority and more consistent solutions with the problem's geometric constraints support \(\frac{7}{16}\) as the simplified fraction for \(OC^2\). Therefore, the final answer is \(p+q=23\).
