        "The comprehensive verification confirms that the derived formula BD^2 = 80 + 16 sinh^2(t2) and the parameter constraint tanh t2 = \u00b15/6 are correct. Substituting these yields the minimal BD^2 = 1280/11. Test values t2=0 and t2\u2192\u221e confirm the formula's validity and behavior. All algebraic identities, numeric computations, and geometric reasoning are consistent and correct. Thus, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 1280/11.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
