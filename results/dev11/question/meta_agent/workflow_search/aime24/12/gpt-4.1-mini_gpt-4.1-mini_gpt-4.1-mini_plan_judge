Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_12
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z|=4 and z=4e^{iθ}, was simplified to 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ = arctan(-4/3). The maximum value of cos(θ + φ) is 1, which occurs when θ + φ = 0 (mod 2π). Therefore, the maximum possible real part of the expression is simply the amplitude 540. This is consistent with the vector magnitude approach and the trigonometric identity used. Hence, the largest possible real part is 540.
