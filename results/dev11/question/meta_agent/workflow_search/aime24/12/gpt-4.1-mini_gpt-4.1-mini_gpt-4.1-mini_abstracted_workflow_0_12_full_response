Given the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, we substitute z and 1/z accordingly. Since |z|=4, 1/z = 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Thus, the expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)((1/4)e^{-iθ}). We can write this as 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (1/4)(96 + 144i)e^{-iθ}. Next, we express e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. We then expand both terms and separate real and imaginary parts. The real part of the expression is the sum of the real parts of both terms. Calculating the real parts: For the first term, 4(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4[(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)]. The real part is 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ).
