Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: The problem states that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. From the first condition, we deduced that (a + d) = 9, (b + e) = 9, and (c + f) = 9, where a,b,c are the digits in the top row and d,e,f are the digits in the bottom row. This is because the sum 999 can be broken down digit-wise as 9 in each place, and since digits are from 0 to 9, the only way to get 9 in each place is that the sum of the corresponding digits in the two rows is 9. From the second condition, the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by columns is 99, which translates to 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. Using the first condition, (d + e + f) = 27 - (a + b + c), substituting gives 9(a + b + c) = 72, so (a + b + c) = 8. Since (a + d) = 9, (b + e) = 9, (c + f) = 9, and digits are between 0 and 9, for each triple (a,b,c) with sum 8, the triple (d,e,f) is uniquely determined as (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit â‰¤ 9 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. The example grid given (0,0,8) and (9,9,1) fits this pattern since 0+9=9, 0+9=9, 8+1=9 and 0+0+8=8. Therefore, the count 45 is consistent with the example and the constraints. No valid assignments are omitted because all triples summing to 8 are considered, and no invalid assignments are included because the digit sums are constrained to 9 and digits are within 0-9. Hence, the final count of 45 is correct.
