Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of 16-step lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves. Exactly four direction changes mean the path is divided into 5 runs alternating between R and U. The path can start either with R or U. If starting with R, the runs are R-U-R-U-R, so there are 3 runs of R and 2 runs of U. The number of ways to split 8 Rs into 3 positive parts is C(7,2) = 21, and to split 8 Us into 2 positive parts is C(7,1) = 7, giving 21*7=147 ways. If starting with U, the runs are U-R-U-R-U, so 3 runs of U and 2 runs of R. The number of ways to split 8 Us into 3 parts is C(7,2) = 21, and to split 8 Rs into 2 parts is C(7,1) = 7, also 21*7=147 ways. Adding both cases, the total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294. This is consistent with the problem constraints and examples.
