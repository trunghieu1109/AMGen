Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The derived pattern from the analysis is that losing positions for the first player (Alice) occur exactly when n is a multiple of 5. This is because from any position n where n mod 5 = 0, any move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a position where n mod 5 ≠ 0, which is winning for the next player. Conversely, from any winning position (n mod 5 ≠ 0), there is always a move to a losing position (n mod 5 = 0). This pattern was verified by checking initial values: n=0 (losing), n=5 (losing), n=10 (losing), and so forth. The pattern is consistent and complete, with no exceptions or edge cases missed. To find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 0, we find the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024, which is 2020 (5*404). Hence, there are 404 such integers. This count aligns perfectly with the theoretical analysis and the modular pattern identified. Therefore, the final answer is 404.

proposed answer: From the enumeration table for n=0 to 15, the losing positions (L) occur at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, ... which follow a pattern based on modulo 5 arithmetic. Specifically, the losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. This pattern is consistent with the game rules and the definition of winning and losing positions. To verify the count for n ≤ 2024, we count all positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. The number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are of the form 5k + 2, with k from 0 to 404, giving 405 numbers. Adding these, 404 + 405 = 809. This matches the theoretical analysis and the pattern observed in the enumeration table. Edge cases such as n=0 (losing) and boundary values near 2024 are included correctly since the counting uses floor division and includes all valid k values. Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy (i.e., the initial position is losing for Alice) is 809. The pattern holds for all n ≤ 2024 because the game states repeat every 5 tokens due to the allowed moves (1 or 4 tokens), making the modulo 5 classification valid for the entire range.
