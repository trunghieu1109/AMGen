Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_15
proposed answer: We are given four items: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Every resident owns candy hearts, so C is the universal set with |C|=900. The problem states: - Exactly two items owned by 437 residents. - Exactly three items owned by 234 residents. - We want to find the number owning all four items (D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S; owning all four means candy hearts plus all three of D, G, S. Let x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| = number owning all three of D, G, S (and thus all four items including candy hearts). Let A = |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|. Using the given equations from the problem: 1) Exactly two items = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2A + 3x = 437 2) Exactly three items = A - 3x = 234 We know |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. From equation (2): A = 234 + 3x Substitute A into equation (1): 195 + 367 + 562 - 2(234 + 3x) + 3x = 437 1124 - 468 - 6x + 3x = 437 656 - 3x = 437 656 - 437 = 3x 219 = 3x x = 73 Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73. Verification: - A = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453 - Exactly two items = 195 + 367 + 562 - 2*453 + 3*73 = 1124 - 906 + 219 = 437 (matches given) - Exactly three items = 453 - 219 = 234 (matches given) The solution is consistent with all constraints and assumptions.
