Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10 numbers. The total number of 4-number subsets from 10 numbers is C(10,4) = 210. The problem states that Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are in the randomly drawn 4 numbers. The counts of subsets with exactly 2, 3, and 4 numbers in common with Jen's chosen set are 90, 24, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the total number of prize-winning subsets is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The grand prize corresponds to the case where all 4 numbers match, which is exactly 1 subset. The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize is thus 1/115. Since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Hence, m = 1 and n = 115, and m + n = 116.
