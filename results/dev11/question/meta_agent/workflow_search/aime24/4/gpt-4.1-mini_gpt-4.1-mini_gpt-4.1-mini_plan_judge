proposed answer: We are given p = 17 and want to find the least positive integer m such that 17^2 = 289 divides m^4 + 1. First, we find solutions modulo 17 to n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 17). Testing small values, n = 2 satisfies 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), so 2 is a solution modulo 17. The other solutions modulo 17 are 7, 10, and 15, since these are congruent to ±2 and ±7 modulo 17. Next, we use Hensel's lemma to lift the solution modulo 17 to modulo 289. Let m = 2 + 17t. We want m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). Compute f(2) = 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 ≡ 17 (mod 289). The derivative f'(x) = 4x^3, so f'(2) = 4 * 8 = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17). Using Hensel's lemma, the correction t satisfies f(2) + f'(2)*17*t ≡ 0 (mod 289). Dividing by 17, we get 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17). The inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8, so t ≡ -1 * 8 ≡ 16 * 8 ≡ 128 ≡ 9 (mod 17). Thus, t = 9 and m = 2 + 17*9 = 155. Checking m^4 + 1 mod 289 confirms divisibility. Since 2 is the smallest positive solution modulo 17, and the lifted solution is unique, m = 155 is the least positive integer such that 289 divides m^4 + 1. This is verified by direct substitution and modular arithmetic checks.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: From previous analysis, the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 is p = 17. The candidate minimal positive integers m satisfying 17^2 | m^4 + 1 were found by lifting roots modulo 17 to modulo 289 (17^2). The candidates are m ≡ 110, 134, 155, 179 (mod 289). Among these, 110 is the smallest positive integer. To confirm, we compute m^4 + 1 modulo 289 explicitly for m = 110. 

Step 1: Compute 110^2 mod 289.
110^2 = 12100.
289 * 41 = 11849, remainder 12100 - 11849 = 251.
So, 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289).

Step 2: Compute 110^4 mod 289 = (110^2)^2 mod 289 = 251^2 mod 289.
251^2 = 63001.
289 * 218 = 62902, remainder 63001 - 62902 = 99.
So, 110^4 ≡ 99 (mod 289).

Step 3: Compute 110^4 + 1 mod 289 = 99 + 1 = 100 mod 289.
This is not zero, so initial calculation seems off.

Re-examining the calculation, let's try a more precise modular exponentiation:

Alternatively, compute 110^4 mod 289 using repeated squaring:
110 mod 289 = 110.
110^2 mod 289 = 251 (as above).
110^4 mod 289 = (110^2)^2 mod 289 = 251^2 mod 289.
251^2 = 63001.
Divide 63001 by 289:
289 * 218 = 62902, remainder 99.
So 110^4 ≡ 99 mod 289.

Adding 1 gives 100 mod 289, not zero.

This contradicts the previous claim that 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289.

Check if the previous candidate m was correct or if the minimal m is different.

Try m = 155:
155^2 = 24025.
289 * 83 = 23987, remainder 38.
So 155^2 ≡ 38 mod 289.
Then 155^4 ≡ 38^2 = 1444 mod 289.
289 * 5 = 1445, remainder 1444 - 1445 = -1 ≡ 288 mod 289.
So 155^4 ≡ 288 mod 289.
Then 155^4 + 1 ≡ 288 + 1 = 289 ≡ 0 mod 289.

So m=155 satisfies the condition.

Try m=134:
134^2 = 17956.
289 * 62 = 17918, remainder 38.
So 134^2 ≡ 38 mod 289.
Then 134^4 ≡ 38^2 = 1444 ≡ 288 mod 289 (as above).
So 134^4 + 1 ≡ 288 + 1 = 289 ≡ 0 mod 289.

Try m=179:
179^2 = 32041.
289 * 110 = 31790, remainder 251.
So 179^2 ≡ 251 mod 289.
Then 179^4 ≡ 251^2 = 63001 ≡ 99 mod 289 (as above).
So 179^4 + 1 ≡ 99 + 1 = 100 mod 289 ≠ 0.

Try m=110 again:
As above, 110^4 + 1 ≡ 100 mod 289 ≠ 0.

Therefore, the candidates that satisfy the condition are m=134 and m=155.
Between these, 134 is smaller.

Hence, the minimal positive integer m such that 17^2 divides m^4 + 1 is 134.

Final verification:
134^2 mod 289 = 38.
134^4 mod 289 = 38^2 = 1444 ≡ 1444 - 5*289 = 1444 - 1445 = -1 ≡ 288 mod 289.
So 134^4 + 1 ≡ 288 + 1 = 289 ≡ 0 mod 289.

This confirms the divisibility.

Therefore, the minimal positive integer m is 134, and p=17.

This detailed modular arithmetic check confirms the correctness and minimality of m=134.

Answer:The least prime p is 17, and the least positive integer m such that 17^2 divides m^4 + 1 is 134. Verification: 134^2 ≡ 38 (mod 289), 134^4 ≡ 38^2 ≡ 288 (mod 289), so 134^4 + 1 ≡ 288 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289), confirming divisibility.
