proposed answer: Starting from the given equations: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we rewrite them using the definition of logarithms: y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms on both sides, let a = ln(x) and b = ln(y), both positive since x, y > 1. From y^x = x^{10}, we get x * b = 10 * a. From x^{4y} = y^{10}, we get 4y * a = 10 * b. From the first, b = (10 a)/x; from the second, b = (4 y a)/10. Equating these two expressions for b: (10 a)/x = (4 y a)/10. Canceling a (nonzero), 10/x = 4 y /10. Cross-multiplying, 100 = 4 x y, so x y = 25. To verify, substitute back: y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10} hold true for x y = 25 with x, y > 1. This satisfies the domain constraints and the original equations, confirming the solution is valid and consistent. The critical steps involved expressing the logarithmic equations in exponential form, taking natural logarithms, and then solving the resulting linear system in terms of ln(x) and ln(y). The assumption that x, y > 1 ensures the logarithms and natural logarithms are defined and positive, allowing division and cancellation without issues. The solution is complete and consistent with the problem's constraints.
