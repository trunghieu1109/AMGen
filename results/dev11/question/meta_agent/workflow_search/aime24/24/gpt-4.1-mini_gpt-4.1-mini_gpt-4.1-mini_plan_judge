Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From subtask 4, we have the value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) as -25/8. Taking the absolute value gives 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8. The sum m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. To verify, we can check the consistency with the original equations by substituting the values of a, b, and c (log2 x, log2 y, log2 z) and confirming the given logarithmic equations hold true. The calculations are consistent and correct, so the final answer is 33.
