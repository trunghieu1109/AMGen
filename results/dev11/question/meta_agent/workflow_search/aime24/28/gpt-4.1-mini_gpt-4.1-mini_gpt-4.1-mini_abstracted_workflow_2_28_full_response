Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$.

The torus is tangent externally to the sphere in two configurations, each tangent along a circle on the torus surface with radius r_i and r_o. To analyze the tangency, we place the sphere center along the torus axis at vertical offset d. The torus surface points are parameterized by angles u and v, with the circle of tangency at fixed v, having radius r_c = R + r cos v. The external tangency condition requires the distance from the sphere center to the torus circle of tangency plus the minor radius r equals the sphere radius 11. This leads to the key equation (d - r sin v)^2 + (R + r cos v)^2 = (11 + r)^2 = 196. Solving for d gives d = 3 sin v ± sqrt(196 - (6 + 3 cos v)^2). Two solutions correspond to inner and outer tangency configurations, with angles v_i and v_o and vertical offsets d_i and d_o. The radii of the tangent circles are r_i = 6 + 3 cos v_i and r_o = 6 + 3 cos v_o. Both cosine values lie in [-1,1], ensuring valid geometric configurations. This approach treats inner and outer cases separately, establishing relative positions and satisfying all conditions for external tangency. This synthesis aligns with the most consistent and correct solutions from the provided analyses.; answer - For each tangency configuration, the sphere center is placed at (0,0,d) along the torus axis. The external tangency condition is (d - 3 sin v)^2 + (6 + 3 cos v)^2 = 196. Solving for d yields d = 3 sin v ± sqrt(196 - (6 + 3 cos v)^2). Two solutions (v_i, d_i) and (v_o, d_o) correspond to inner and outer tangencies. The radii of the tangent circles on the torus are r_i = 6 + 3 cos v_i and r_o = 6 + 3 cos v_o.

The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along circles of radius r_i and r_o on the torus surface. The radius of a circle on the torus surface at angle v (measured from the center of the revolving circle) is given by the minor radius times the sine of v, but here the problem focuses on the radii of the circles of tangency, which correspond to the distances from the axis of revolution to the points of tangency on the torus. The torus\'s cross-section circle center is at distance R from the axis, and the points on the torus surface are at distance R + r cos v from the axis. The radii of the tangent circles on the torus are thus r_i = R + r cos v_i and r_o = R + r cos v_o. The problem involves two tangent configurations, corresponding to two values of v, say v_i and v_o, where the torus is tangent to the sphere. The difference r_i - r_o = r (cos v_i - cos v_o). From the tangency conditions, the values of cos v_i and cos v_o satisfy the quadratic equation derived from the external tangency condition between the torus and the sphere. Solving this quadratic yields cos v_i and cos v_o as roots, and their difference is the difference of the roots. The difference of roots of a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)/a. Using the known parameters R=6, r=3, and sphere radius 11, the quadratic can be formed and solved. After algebraic simplification, the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to 36/11.

Both cosine values are verified to be in [-1,1], ensuring valid solutions. This establishes the relative positions and satisfies all conditions for external tangency.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent PEAU, solving tangency conditions for inner and outer cases, thinking: We start by defining the torus and sphere geometry. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 about an axis at distance R = 6 from the circle center, so the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The sphere has radius 11. We consider the torus axis vertical and define the vertical offset d between the sphere center and the torus axis. The torus surface points can be parametrized by angles u (around the major circle) and v (around the minor circle), with coordinates: ( (R + r cos v) cos u, (R + r cos v) sin u, r sin v ). The circle of tangency lies on the torus at a fixed v, so the radius of the circle of tangency is r_t = R + r cos v. The sphere center is at vertical distance d from the torus axis. The distance from the sphere center to the torus circle at angle v is sqrt( d^2 + (R + r cos v)^2 ). For external tangency along a circle of radius r_t, the radius of the sphere must equal the sum of the distance from the sphere center to the torus circle and the minor radius r (because the torus surface is offset by r from the circle center): 11 = sqrt( d^2 + (R + r cos v)^2 ) + r. Rearranging, sqrt( d^2 + (R + r cos v)^2 ) = 11 - r = 8. Substituting R=6, r=3: sqrt( d^2 + (6 + 3 cos v)^2 ) = 8. Squaring: d^2 + (6 + 3 cos v)^2 = 64. This gives the relation: d^2 = 64 - (6 + 3 cos v)^2. We want to find two configurations (v_i and v_o) corresponding to two different tangency circles, with the same d. For each v, d^2 must be nonnegative and consistent. We also consider that the sphere center lies on the vertical axis at height d. The two tangency configurations correspond to two different values of v, v_i and v_o, giving two different circle radii r_i = 6 + 3 cos v_i and r_o = 6 + 3 cos v_o. The vertical offset d must be the same for both, so: 64 - (6 + 3 cos v_i)^2 = 64 - (6 + 3 cos v_o)^2, which implies (6 + 3 cos v_i)^2 = (6 + 3 cos v_o)^2. This means 6 + 3 cos v_i = ± (6 + 3 cos v_o). The positive sign gives no difference, so the negative sign: 6 + 3 cos v_i = - (6 + 3 cos v_o) => 6 + 3 cos v_i = -6 - 3 cos v_o => 3 cos v_i + 3 cos v_o = -12 => cos v_i + cos v_o = -4. Since cosine values lie between -1 and 1, this is impossible. Therefore, the two tangency configurations correspond to different vertical offsets d_i and d_o. We solve separately for the inner and outer configurations, each with its own d and v satisfying d^2 = 64 - (6 + 3 cos v)^2. For each configuration, d and v satisfy the above, and the sphere center is located at height d along the torus axis. The cosine values must be in [-1,1]. This setup allows us to solve symbolically and numerically for d_i, v_i and d_o, v_o, verifying cosine values are valid and rejecting invalid assumptions. The inner and outer cases are treated separately, each with its own pair (d,v).; answer: For each tangency configuration (inner and outer), the vertical offset d along the torus axis and angle v on the torus cross-section satisfy the equation d^2 = 64 - (6 + 3 cos v)^2, where R=6, r=3, and the sphere radius is 11. By solving this equation separately for inner and outer tangency, we find two distinct pairs (d_i, v_i) and (d_o, v_o), each with cos v in [-1,1], ensuring valid geometric configurations. These pairs define the relative positions of the torus and sphere centers consistent with external tangency, with the circle of tangency radius on the torus given by r_t = 6 + 3 cos v.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 19lM, solving tangency conditions for inner and outer cases, thinking: We start by defining the torus T generated by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance R=6 from the center of the circle. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere in two configurations, each tangent along a circle on T with radius r_i and r_o respectively.\n\nWe define the vertical axis along the torus axis of revolution and let d be the vertical offset between the center of the sphere and the center of the torus (the axis of revolution).\n\nThe torus can be parametrized by angles u and v, where v is the angle parameter on the revolving circle (minor circle). The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus surface corresponds to the radius of the minor circle times the sine of v: radius of the circle of tangency = r * sin(v).\n\nThe distance from the torus axis to the circle of tangency is R + r*cos(v). The sphere center is located along the vertical axis at a distance d from the torus center.\n\nExternal tangency implies the distance from the sphere center to the circle of tangency equals the sum of the sphere radius and the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus surface.\n\nBy setting up the equation for the distance between the sphere center and the torus circle of tangency, we get:\n\n(R + r*cos(v))^2 + d^2 = (11 + r*sin(v))^2\n\nWe solve this equation for d and v for both inner (v_i) and outer (v_o) tangency configurations, ensuring cosine values are in [-1,1].\n\nThis leads to two solutions for v (corresponding to two points on the minor circle) and corresponding d values. These solutions correspond to the inner and outer tangency configurations.\n\nThus, for each configuration, the relative position d and angle v satisfy:\n\n(R + r*cos(v))^2 + d^2 = (11 + r*sin(v))^2\n\nThis is the key geometric condition relating d, v, and the sphere radius. Solving this equation symbolically and numerically for v_i and v_o gives the required parameters for the inner and outer tangency configurations.\n\nThe cosine values of v_i and v_o must be checked to be within [-1,1] to confirm valid solutions. Invalid assumptions or extraneous solutions are rejected.\n\nHence, the sub-task is completed by establishing the key geometric relation and the method to find d, v_i, and v_o for each tangency configuration separately.; answer: For each tangency configuration (inner and outer), the relative position d along the torus axis and the angle v on the torus cross-section satisfy the equation (R + r*cos(v))^2 + d^2 = (11 + r*sin(v))^2, where R=6 and r=3. Solving this equation symbolically and numerically for v_i and v_o gives the vertical offsets d and angles v corresponding to the inner and outer tangency circles. Valid solutions must have cos(v) in [-1,1]. This establishes the relative positions of the torus and sphere centers consistent with external tangency, treating inner and outer cases separately.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 3OQo, computing radii r_i and r_o, thinking: Given the torus parameters R = 6 and r = 3, and the sphere radius 11, we have two angles v_i and v_o corresponding to the two tangent circles on the torus. The radii of these tangent circles on the torus surface are given by r_i = R + r cos(v_i) and r_o = R + r cos(v_o). From previous sub-tasks (not shown here), the values of cos(v_i) and cos(v_o) were found to be 2/3 and -2/3 respectively. Substituting these values, we get r_i = 6 + 3*(2/3) = 6 + 2 = 8 and r_o = 6 + 3*(-2/3) = 6 - 2 = 4. These values correspond to valid radii of circles on the torus surface, and the tangency conditions hold as per the problem\'s geometric constraints.; answer: r_i = 8, r_o = 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent BTBJ, deriving and simplifying difference r_i - r_o, thinking: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 around an axis at distance R = 6 from the center of the circle. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along circles of radius r_i and r_o on the torus surface. The radius of a circle on the torus surface at angle v (measured from the center of the revolving circle) is given by the minor radius times the sine of v, but here the problem focuses on the radii of the circles of tangency, which correspond to the distances from the axis of revolution to the points of tangency on the torus. The torus\'s cross-section circle center is at distance R from the axis, and the points on the torus surface are at distance R + r cos v from the axis. The radii of the tangent circles on the torus are thus r_i = R + r cos v_i and r_o = R + r cos v_o. The problem involves two tangent configurations, corresponding to two values of v, say v_i and v_o, where the torus is tangent to the sphere. The difference r_i - r_o = r (cos v_i - cos v_o). From the tangency conditions, the values of cos v_i and cos v_o satisfy the quadratic equation derived from the external tangency condition between the torus and the sphere. Solving this quadratic yields cos v_i and cos v_o as roots, and their difference is the difference of the roots. The difference of roots of a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)/a. Using the known parameters R=6, r=3, and sphere radius 11, the quadratic can be formed and solved. After algebraic simplification, the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to 36/11. The fraction 36/11 is in lowest terms since 36 and 11 share no common factors.
