Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on kinetic energy of mu(+). 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent vBZF:
Using energy–momentum conservation for π+→μ+ν with stationary pion, T_μ = [(m_π² + m_μ²)c²/(2m_π)] – m_μc². Plugging m_π=139.6 MeV, m_μ=105.7 MeV gives (139.6²+105.7²)/(2·139.6)–105.7 ≃4.12 MeV.

### answer by Final Decision Agent vBZF:
4.12 MeV

### Sub-task 6: Calculate kinetic energy of neutrino using conservation of energy and momentum, and kinetic energy of mu(+) obtained previously. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent IXzb:
Using energy conservation: E_ν = m_πc² – E_μ = 139.6 MeV – (105.7 + 4.12) MeV ≃ 29.8 MeV, and since m_ν≈0, this is its kinetic energy.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent IXzb:
29.8 MeV

### Sub-task 7: Compare calculated kinetic energies of mu(+) and neutrino with provided multiple-choice options to identify the correct pair. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OfZu (yourself):
The computed kinetic energies are T_μ ≃4.12 MeV and T_ν ≃29.8 MeV, which correspond exactly to choice 4.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OfZu (yourself):
D)

### Review the comparison and correctness of identified choice. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 7Dc4:
The comparison is accurate: the calculated kinetic energies (Tₘᵤ ≃ 4.12 MeV and T_ν ≃ 29.8 MeV) exactly match choice 4, so the identified choice is correct.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare calculated kinetic energies of mu(+) and neutrino with provided multiple-choice options to identify the correct pair.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
