No extra data is needed, so we can fully answer.; answer: In the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν:\nParticles involved: π⁺ (pion), μ⁺ (muon), ν (neutrino).\nRest masses: m_π = 139.6 MeV/c², m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c², m_ν ≃ 0.\nKnown quantities: initial pion is at rest so its total energy = m_πc²; rest masses of pion and muon.\nUnknown quantities to solve for: kinetic energies (or momenta) of the muon and the neutrino.\nCoT-SC agent y5Cv, identifying conservation laws, thinking: The sub-task asks to state which conservation laws apply when a stationary pion decays into a muon and neutrino. Energy conservation equates the pion’s rest energy to the sum of daughter energies, and momentum conservation requires the vector sum of their momenta to vanish.; answer: Conservation of energy: m_π c² = E_μ + E_ν, with E_μ = √((p_μ c)² + (m_μ c²)²) and E_ν = p_ν c.  Conservation of momentum: p_μ + p_ν = 0 (initial pion momentum is zero).\nCoT-SC agent g2Xu, identifying conservation laws, thinking: The user asks to list the conservation laws applicable to the decay π⁺→μ⁺+ν when the pion is at rest. No missing information—just identify energy and momentum conservation and mention the relativistic relation.; answer: Sub-task 2: The applicable principles are:\n1) Conservation of total energy: since the pion is at rest, E_initial = m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν.\n2) Conservation of momentum: initial momentum is zero, so p_μ + p_ν = 0 (the muon and neutrino momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction).\nAdditionally, use the relativistic energy–momentum relation for each particle: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\nCoT-SC agent Cubc, identifying conservation laws, thinking: The sub-task simply asks which conservation laws apply to the decay of a stationary pion. We invoke total energy conservation (rest energy of the pion equals sum of total energies of muon and neutrino) and total momentum conservation (initial momentum zero so outgoing particles have equal and opposite momenta).; answer: Applicable principles:\n1. Conservation of energy: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν, where E_μ = √(p²c² + m_μ²c⁴) and E_ν = pc (m_ν ≃ 0).\n2. Conservation of momentum: 0 = p_μ + p_ν ⇒ p_μ = p_ν = p.\nCoT agent nOed, deriving energy and momentum relations, thinking: The task asks for deriving the total energy and momentum relations for the muon and neutrino in the decay π⁺→μ⁺+ν when the pion is at rest. We use energy conservation m_πc²=E_μ+E_ν and momentum conservation p_μ+p_ν=0. The neutrino is effectively massless (m_ν≈0). From these we solve for E_μ, E_ν and the common momentum.; answer: Using conservation laws for a stationary π⁺:  \n1) Energy conservation:  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν  \n2) Momentum conservation:  p_μ + p_ν = 0 ⇒ |p_μ| = |p_ν| ≡ p  \n3) Relate energy and momentum:  E_μ = √[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²] = m_μc² + T_μ,   E_ν = pc = T_ν  \n4) Solve for p:  \n   m_π²c⁴ = E_μ² + 2E_μE_ν + E_ν²  \n   Using E_ν = pc and E_μ² = p²c² + m_μ²c⁴ gives  p = (m_π² – m_μ²)c / (2m_π)  \n5) Explicit energies:  \n   E_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)c² / (2m_π)  \n   E_ν = (m_π² – m_μ²)c² / (2m_π)  \n6) Kinetic energies:  \n   T_μ = E_μ – m_μc²  \n   T_ν = E_ν  \nThese relations express total energies and momenta in terms of rest masses and kinetic energies as required.\nCoT agent mGv8, formulating kinetic energy equations, thinking: We use energy conservation m_πc²=E_μ+E_ν and momentum conservation p_μ=p_ν=p. From E_μ=√(p²c²+m_μ²c⁴) and E_ν=pc, and p=(m_π²−m_μ²)c/(2m_π), we express kinetic energies preparing for numerical substitution.; answer: T_μ = E_μ – m_μc² = \\frac{(m_π² + m_μ²)c²}{2m_π} – m_μc²;\nT_ν = E_ν = \\frac{(m_π² – m_μ²)c²}{2m_π}\nDebate agent Qv43, round 0, calculating KE of mu(+), thinking: Using T_μ = [(m_π² + m_μ²)c²/(2 m_π)] – m_μc² with m_π=139.6 MeV, m_μ=105.7 MeV: numerator = 139.6²+105.7² ≈30659.4, divided by (2×139.6)=279.2 gives ≈109.81 MeV.
