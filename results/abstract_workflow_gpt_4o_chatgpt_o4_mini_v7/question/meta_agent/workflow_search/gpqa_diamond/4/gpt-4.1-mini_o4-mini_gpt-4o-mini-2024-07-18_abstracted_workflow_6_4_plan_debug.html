{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Normalize the eigenvector obtained in subtask_5 to ensure unit norm, consistent with quantum mechanical state vector normalization. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 65eB:
The eigenvector from subtask 5 is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))^T. Its norm squared is cos^2(θ/2)+sin^2(θ/2)=1, so it is already normalized.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 65eB:
The normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))^T.

### Sub-task 2: Interpret the direction vector n lying in the x-z plane, parameterize it in terms of an angle θ, express n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8:
We need to express a unit vector in the x–z plane in terms of an angle θ measured from the z‐axis, yielding components along x and z. This yields n=(sinθ,0,cosθ).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8:
n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Express the normalized eigenvector in terms of θ (angle defining direction n in x-z plane), and compare the resulting form with the given multiple-choice options to identify the correct normalized eigenvector expression.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
