Its norm squared is cos^2(θ/2)+sin^2(θ/2)=1, so it is already normalized.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 65eB:\nThe normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))^T.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Interpret the direction vector n lying in the x-z plane, parameterize it in terms of an angle θ, express n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8:\nWe need to express a unit vector in the x–z plane in terms of an angle θ measured from the z‐axis, yielding components along x and z.

The eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ⟩ = +ħ/2|ψ⟩ becomes a 2×2 matrix equation. Dividing both sides by ħ/2 simplifies the problem to finding the eigenvector of [[cosθ, sinθ];[sinθ, −cosθ]] with eigenvalue 1.; answer: The eigenvalue equation is:\n(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = (ħ/2) [ψ₁; ψ₂]\nDivide by ħ/2 to get the matrix form:\n[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = [ψ₁; ψ₂]\nOr equivalently as a homogeneous system:\n[ [cosθ − 1, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ − 1] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = [0; 0].\nDebate agent Awku, round 0, solving eigenvalue equation, thinking: We have (P·n)/(ħ/2) = [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ,−cosθ]].
