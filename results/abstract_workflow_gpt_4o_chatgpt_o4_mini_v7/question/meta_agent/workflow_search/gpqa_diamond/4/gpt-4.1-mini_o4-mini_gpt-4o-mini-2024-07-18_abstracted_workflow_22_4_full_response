We simply restate these matrices multiplied by ħ/2 and note that a unit vector in the x–z plane can be written as (sinθ,\u20090,\u2009cosθ).; answer: Px = (ħ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]]; Py = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]; Pz = (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]; direction vector n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).\nCoT agent ieey, formulating operator P along n, thinking: From subtask 1 we have Px = (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] and Pz = (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. For a unit vector n=(sinθ,0,cosθ) in the x–z plane, the operator along n is P_n = n·P = sinθ Px + cosθ Pz. Substituting the matrices yields P_n = (ħ/2)[sinθ[[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ[[1,0],[0,-1]]] = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]].; answer: P_n = sinθ Px + cosθ Pz = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]\nCoT agent eJow, setting up eigenvalue equation, thinking: We have P_n = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]. The eigenvalue equation P_n|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2)|ψ⟩ can be written by subtracting (ħ/2)I to get a homogeneous system.; answer: Set up: \\n((ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] - (ħ/2)I)\\begin{pmatrix}ψ₁\\\\ψ₂\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}.\\nEquivalently, dividing by ħ/2: \\n[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]\\begin{pmatrix}ψ₁\\\\ψ₂\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}ψ₁\\\\ψ₂\\end{pmatrix},\\nwhich gives the component equations: \\ncosθ·ψ₁ + sinθ·ψ₂ = ψ₁,\\nsinθ·ψ₁ - cosθ·ψ₂ = ψ₂.\nCoT agent xahL, solving eigenvalue equation, thinking: We divide the eigenvalue equation by ħ/2 to get [cosθ  sinθ; sinθ  −cosθ][ψ₁;ψ₂]=[ψ₁;ψ₂]. From the first row: cosθψ₁+sinθψ₂=ψ₁ ⇒ sinθψ₂=(1−cosθ)ψ₁ ⇒ ψ₂=(1−cosθ)/sinθ·ψ₁=tan(θ/2)ψ₁. Normalizing |ψ|=1 gives ψ₁=cos(θ/2), ψ₂=sin(θ/2).; answer: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nCoT agent pDor, normalizing eigenvector, thinking: The eigenvector from subtask 4 is (cos(θ/2),\u2009sin(θ/2)).
