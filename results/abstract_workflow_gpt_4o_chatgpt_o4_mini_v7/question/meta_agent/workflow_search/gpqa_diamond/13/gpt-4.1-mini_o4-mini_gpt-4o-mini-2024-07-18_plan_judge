Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_13
proposed answer: PFA+DSG fixation stabilizes strong, multicomponent complexes (e.g., at promoters/enhancers) while disrupting weak, transient or low‐affinity interactions. IKAROS peaks lost upon DSG addition therefore most likely represent nonspecific or low‐affinity binding at repetitive elements, which are crosslinked less efficiently by DSG.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_13
proposed answer: Stronger PFA+DSG fixation stabilizes direct DNA–protein crosslinks but can mask or alter weak, protein–protein–mediated interactions. IKAROS indirect binding at repetitive elements often relies on protein complexes, so these peaks vanish under harsher crosslinking. Direct sites at promoters/enhancers remain detectable.
