Its norm squared is (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so it is normalized.\nCoT agent Gp5k, expressing sigma matrices, thinking: To express Pauli matrices in the |↑>,|↓> basis where |↑> and |↓> are eigenstates of σ_z with eigenvalues +1 and –1, we use the standard representations. σ_z is diagonal with entries (1,–1), while σ_x flips the basis states so it has off-diagonal ones.; answer: σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]; σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nCoT agent 755K, constructing combined operator, thinking: Multiply σ_z and σ_x by their coefficients and add component-wise: 10*[[1,0],[0,-1]] + 5*[[0,1],[1,0]] yields the result.; answer: 10*σ_z + 5*σ_x = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]\nCoT agent clEh, calculating expectation value, thinking: We have |ψ⟩=[0.5,√3/2]^T and M=10σ_z+5σ_x=[[10,5],[5,-10]]. First compute M|ψ⟩=[10·0.5+5·(√3/2),5·0.5−10·(√3/2)]^T=[9.330,−6.160]^T.
