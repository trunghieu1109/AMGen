The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2, and summing their squared magnitudes gives 1, confirming normalization.; answer: The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5\u2009|↑⟩ + (√3/2)\u2009|↓⟩. In vector form (in the {|↑⟩,|↓⟩} basis):\n[0.5,\u2009√3/2]^T. Its norm squared is (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, so it is normalized.\nCoT agent rF5v, expressing sigma_z and sigma_x matrices, thinking: The problem asks for the standard representations of the Pauli matrices in the spin-z eigenbasis; these are well-known 2×2 matrices.; answer: sigma_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]; sigma_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nCoT agent iMkA, constructing operator matrix, thinking: We multiply sigma_z matrix by 10: 10*[[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[10,0],[0,-10]]; and sigma_x by 5: 5*[[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0,5],[5,0]].
