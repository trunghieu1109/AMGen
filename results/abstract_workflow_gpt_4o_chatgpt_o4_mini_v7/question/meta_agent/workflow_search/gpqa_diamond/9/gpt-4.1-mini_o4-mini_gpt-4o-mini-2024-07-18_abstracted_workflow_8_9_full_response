Here M=0.5\u2009M⊕ and R=R⊕×(0.5)^(1/3), so ρ=M/(4/3πR^3)=0.5\u2009M⊕/[4/3π(R⊕^3×0.5)]=M⊕/(4/3πR⊕^3)=ρ⊕≈5.5\u2009g/cm^3.; answer: 5.5 g/cm^3\nDebate agent kLLR, round 0, comparing densities and deciding highest density planet, thinking: Each choice yields roughly 5.5 g/cm³: (a) Earth’s density, (b) given as 5.5 g/cm³, (c) same composition ⇒ ρ≈Earth’s, (d) same composition ⇒ ρ≈Earth’s.
