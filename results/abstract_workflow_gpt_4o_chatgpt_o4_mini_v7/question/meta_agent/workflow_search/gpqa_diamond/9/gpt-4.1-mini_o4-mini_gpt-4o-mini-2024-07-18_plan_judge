Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_9
proposed answer: Average density of a rocky planet increases with mass due to self-compression. Thus a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive will be more compressed and have a higher mean density than Earth, a 2 M⊕ planet with 5.5 g/cm³, or a 0.5 M⊕ planet.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_9
proposed answer: We calculated the densities for each option: a, c, and d all yield densities of approximately 5.51 g/cm³, slightly higher than option b (5.50 g/cm³). Thus, the highest density planets are a, c, and d.
