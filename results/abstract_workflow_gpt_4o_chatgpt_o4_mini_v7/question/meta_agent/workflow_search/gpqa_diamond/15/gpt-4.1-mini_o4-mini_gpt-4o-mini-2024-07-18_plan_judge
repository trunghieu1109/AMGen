Question: Example(question='How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one', choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_15
proposed answer: Based on identification of compounds 2, 4, 5, and 6 as optically active, the total count is 4, which corresponds to choice B.

Answer:B)
