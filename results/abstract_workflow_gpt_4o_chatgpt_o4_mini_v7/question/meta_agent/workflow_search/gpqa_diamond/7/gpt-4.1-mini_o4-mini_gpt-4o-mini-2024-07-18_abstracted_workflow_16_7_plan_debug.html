    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Integrate findings from Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4 to draw a comprehensive conclusion about the roles of G1, G2, and G3, including which gene is a transcription factor, the nature of gene interactions, and epistatic relationships. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent UN6v:
The loss of G2 abolishes resistance in single and all double mutants, indicating it acts upstream and is epistatic. G1 and G3 single mutants retain partial resistance but the double mutant is nearly fully susceptible, indicating they provide overlapping (redundant) defense functions. No further genes appear epistatic outside of G2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent KfIY:
Based on the knockout phenotypes, G2 loss abolishes resistance alone and in all double mutants, characteristic of an upstream transcription factor that is epistatic over G1 and G3. G1 and G3 single mutants retain substantial resistance but the double mutant shows a synergistic drop, indicating partial redundancy. Thus G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream, G1 and G3 function redundantly in defense, and G2 is epistatic to both.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mqRp:
G2 knockout alone abolishes resistance and fixes the phenotype at 0% in all double mutants, identifying it as acting upstream—characteristic of a transcription factor—and epistatic to G1 and G3. The g1 and g3 single mutants retain 75% and 50% resistance respectively but together drop to 10%, indicating partial redundancy between G1 and G3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent q69j:
G2 knockout abolishes resistance in both single and all double mutants, indicating it acts upstream and is epistatic to G1 and G3—a hallmark of a transcription factor. G1 and G3 single knockouts retain partial resistance (75% and 50%), but the g1g3 double mutant drops to 10%, showing a synergistic effect consistent with partial redundancy rather than epistasis between them.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent UN6v:
G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function redundantly in anthracnose resistance, with their combined loss causing a synergistic drop in resistance.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent KfIY:
G2 is the transcription factor; G1 and G3 show genetic redundancy with partial functional overlap; G2 acts epistatically upstream of both G1 and G3.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent mqRp:
G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show genetic redundancy, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent q69j:
G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream; G1 and G3 show partial genetic redundancy in disease resistance; G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on gene roles and interactions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The knockout phenotypes show that loss of G2 abolishes resistance in all contexts (single and double mutants), indicating G2 acts upstream as a transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The partial resistance in g1 and g3 single mutants, but near-total loss in the g1g3 double, indicates G1 and G3 function redundantly in disease resistance.

Answer:G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream; G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function redundantly in anthracnose resistance.</pre>
