None of the given choices matches all three conclusions: each choice incorrectly assigns an epistatic relationship or pleiotropy.

Double mutants: g1g2: 0% of wild-type resistance; g1g3: 10% of wild-type resistance; g2g3: 0% of wild-type resistance.\nCoT-SC agent 1Fjq, identifying critical gene(s), thinking: I reviewed the summarized resistance levels and noted that g2 alone gives 0% resistance, as do double mutants involving g2, indicating G2 is critical.; answer: Knockout of G2 causes the most severe loss of resistance, indicating G2’s critical role in anthracnose resistance.\nCoT-SC agent KrZn, identifying critical gene(s), thinking: The resistance data show that the g2 single mutant has 0% resistance (complete loss), whereas g1 and g3 single mutants retain 75% and 50%, respectively. Double mutants involving g2 also show 0%, confirming g2’s critical role.; answer: g2\nCoT-SC agent xFvZ, identifying critical gene(s), thinking: The data show that the g2 single mutant and both double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) all have 0% resistance, whereas g1 and g3 single mutants retain significant resistance. This indicates that loss of G2 causes a complete loss of resistance, marking it as the critical gene.; answer: G2\nCoT agent fYtR, analyzing partial and additive effects, thinking: Based on Sub-task 1 data, g1 and g3 single knockouts show intermediate resistance (75% and 50%), indicating they each contribute partially or redundantly. In double knockouts, g1g3’s resistance (10%) is much lower than expected from simply adding or multiplying the single effects, indicating a synergistic interaction. g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, same as g2 alone, so no further additive effect beyond g2’s complete loss.; answer: Single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) show partial resistance loss, suggesting partial contribution or redundancy. Double mutant g1g3 shows a synergistic effect on resistance loss (10% vs. expected higher), while g1g2 and g2g3 both mirror g2’s 0% resistance, indicating no additional additive effect.\nCoT agent xGoY, inferring transcription factor, thinking: The g2 knockout alone leads to complete loss of resistance (0%). Adding g1 or g3 knockouts to g2 (g1g2, g2g3) does not further reduce resistance, indicating G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3. Thus G2 is the key transcription factor.; answer: G2 is likely the transcription factor acting upstream.\nDebate agent 0dkF, round 0, analyzing G1-G3 interaction, thinking: Single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) show partial resistance losses, indicating they both contribute redundantly. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is more severe than expected from either alone, showing a synergistic interaction rather than one gene masking the other. Therefore, G1 and G3 function redundantly and no clear epistasis (masking) is observed.; answer: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy; there is no epistatic relationship (they interact synergistically without one masking the other).\nDebate agent nHEh, round 0, analyzing G1-G3 interaction, thinking: Single g1 and g3 mutants show only partial loss of resistance (75% and 50%), but the double shows a much more severe drop (10%), indicating they act redundantly and synergistically rather than in a strict linear epistatic pathway. Because the double phenotype is more extreme than either single, neither gene simply masks the other, so we cannot assign epistasis to G1 or G3.; answer: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy with synergistic interaction; no clear epistasis, so neither gene is epistatic over the other.\nFinal Decision agent, deciding G1-G3 interaction, thinking: G1 and G3 single mutants each show partial loss of resistance (75% and 50%), but the double mutant drops to 10%, a more severe effect than either alone. This indicates they function redundantly (additive/synergistic) rather than in a linear pathway where one masks the other. Thus there is no epistatic relationship between G1 and G3.; answer: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy with synergistic interaction; neither gene is epistatic over the other.\nDebate agent OLFK, round 0, integrating findings and selecting conclusion, thinking: G2 knockout causes complete susceptibility and is not further worsened by additional knockouts, indicating G2 is the upstream transcription factor. G1 and G3 single knockouts give partial resistance but the double knockout is nearly full susceptibility, showing redundancy rather than a linear pathway.
