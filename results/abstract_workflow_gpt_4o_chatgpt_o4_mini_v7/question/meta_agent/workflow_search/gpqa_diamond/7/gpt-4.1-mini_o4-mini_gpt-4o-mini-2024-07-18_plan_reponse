            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

        "response": "The experimental data indicate that G2 knockout alone results in full susceptibility and additional knockouts do not worsen this, identifying G2 as the upstream transcription factor. G1 and G3 single mutants show partial resistance while the double mutant is nearly fully susceptible, consistent with redundancy rather than a linear pathway. No epistatic masking is observed between G1 and G3. None of the provided choices correctly omits an epistatic relationship, so the closest match is choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)\n[TOO_HARD] The provided options incorrectly assign epistasis between G1 and G3; please supply a choice reflecting G2 as a transcription factor, G1 and G3 redundancy, and no epistasis.",
