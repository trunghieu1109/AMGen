Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_0
proposed answer: The minimum resolvable energy difference is on the order of ΔE_min ≈ħ/τ ≈3.6×10⁻⁷ eV. Of the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, so it alone allows clear resolution.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: The combined energy uncertainty from the state lifetimes is about 7.3×10⁻⁷ eV, so only the 10⁻⁴ eV difference exceeds this and allows clear resolution.
