    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;10^-4 eV&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Compare the calculated minimum energy difference with the given options: 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, 10^-4 eV. Identify which option(s) satisfy the condition for clear resolution of the two energy levels. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent w2TS:
To clearly resolve, ΔE must exceed combined uncertainty (~7.3×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is larger than 7.3×10⁻⁷ eV. The others are too small.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent w2TS:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Select the correct energy difference option from the choices provided that meets the criteria for clear resolution based on previous calculations and comparisons.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The combined energy uncertainty from the state lifetimes is about 7.3×10⁻⁷ eV, so only the 10⁻⁴ eV difference exceeds this and allows clear resolution.
