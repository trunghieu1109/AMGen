This is straightforward extraction from the problem statement.; answer: Lifetimes: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\nEnergy‐difference options: 10⁻⁹ eV, 10⁻¹¹ eV, 10⁻⁸ eV, 10⁻⁴ eV\nCoT agent bB4u, recalling energy-time uncertainty, thinking: Apply the energy–time uncertainty principle ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt with ħ ≃ 6.582×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV·s. Compute for each lifetime.; answer: The energy–time uncertainty relation is ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. For τ₁ = 10⁻⁹\u2009s: ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV·s)/(10⁻⁹\u2009s) ≃ 6.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV.

The difference must exceed this combined width so the broadened spectral lines do not overlap, allowing clear resolution.; answer: The minimum energy difference required is ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≃ 6.6×10⁻⁷ eV + 6.6×10⁻⁸ eV ≃ 7.3×10⁻⁷ eV. The spacing must exceed the sum of the levels’ linewidths so their broadened peaks remain distinct.\nCoT agent w2TS, comparing options, thinking: To clearly resolve, ΔE must exceed combined uncertainty (~7.3×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is larger than 7.3×10⁻⁷ eV.
