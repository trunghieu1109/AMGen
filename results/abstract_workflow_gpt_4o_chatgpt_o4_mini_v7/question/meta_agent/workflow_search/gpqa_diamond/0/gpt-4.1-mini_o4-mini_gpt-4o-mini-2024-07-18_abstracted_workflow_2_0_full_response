For τ1=10⁻⁹ s and τ2=10⁻⁸ s, the corresponding energy uncertainties are on the order of ħ/(2τ), i.e. ~3×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV and ~3×10⁻¹⁷\u2009eV. To clearly distinguish two levels, their separation must exceed the larger uncertainty.; answer: The lifetimes τ1=10⁻⁹\u2009s and τ2=10⁻⁸\u2009s imply energy uncertainties ΔE1≈ħ/(2τ1)~3×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV and ΔE2≈ħ/(2τ2)~3×10⁻¹⁷\u2009eV. To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must exceed (by at least a few times) these uncertainties, i.e. be well above ~10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV.\nCoT-SC agent DmaR, explaining lifetime-energy uncertainty relation, thinking: The question asks for an explanation of how the lifetime of a quantum state relates to the uncertainty in its energy via the energy–time uncertainty principle. This is straightforward: use ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2 and discuss the inverse relation between lifetime and energy uncertainty.; answer: According to the energy–time uncertainty principle, ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2. Here Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state and ΔE is the uncertainty (or width) of its energy level. A shorter lifetime (small Δt) leads to a larger energy uncertainty ΔE, while a longer lifetime (large Δt) yields a smaller ΔE. Thus, the more short-lived a state is, the less precisely its energy is defined, and conversely, a long-lived state has a sharply defined energy level.\nCoT-SC agent MasV, explaining lifetime-energy uncertainty relation, thinking: The question asks for a conceptual explanation using the time–energy uncertainty principle. The relation ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2 directly links the state lifetime (Δt) to its energy uncertainty (ΔE), so I can clearly explain that without needing extra data.; answer: According to the energy–time uncertainty principle, ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2, where Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state and ΔE is the uncertainty (or width) of its energy. Thus ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt): shorter lifetimes (smaller Δt) lead to larger uncertainties in energy (broader energy levels), while longer lifetimes yield smaller energy uncertainties (sharper levels).\nCoT-SC agent MHjR, explaining lifetime-energy uncertainty relation, thinking: The user asks for an explanation of the relationship between state lifetime and energy uncertainty using ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2. No critical details are missing, so a direct conceptual answer is sufficient.; answer: According to the energy–time uncertainty principle, ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2, the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a quantum state, the larger its inherent energy uncertainty (ΔE). Conversely, a longer-lived state has a smaller energy width. Thus lifetime and energy precision are inversely related: rapid decay (small Δt) smears out the energy level, while very stable states (large Δt) have sharply defined energies.\nCoT agent 25tA, calculating energy uncertainties, thinking: To find the minimum energy uncertainty for each state, use ΔE ≳ ħ/(2Δt). In eV·s units, ħ≈6.58×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV·s. For Δt=10⁻⁹\u2009s: ΔE₁≈6.58×10⁻¹⁶/(2×10⁻⁹)=3.29×10⁻⁷\u2009eV. For Δt=10⁻⁸\u2009s: ΔE₂≈6.58×10⁻¹⁶/(2×10⁻⁸)=3.29×10⁻⁸\u2009eV.; answer: ΔE₁ ≳3.3×10⁻⁷\u2009eV; ΔE₂ ≳3.3×10⁻⁸\u2009eV\nCoT agent OnZo, determining minimum energy difference, thinking: To resolve the two levels, their separation must exceed the combined uncertainties. From Sub-task 3, ΔE₁≈3.29×10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂≈3.29×10⁻⁸ eV, so ΔE_min ≳ΔE₁+ΔE₂≈3.62×10⁻⁷ eV.; answer: The minimum energy difference required is about 3.6×10⁻⁷ eV.\nDebate agent 7vBS, round 0, evaluating energy difference options, thinking: The minimum required ΔE is ≈3.6×10⁻⁷ eV.
