    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;10^-4 eV&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Evaluate each energy difference option (10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, 10^-4 eV) against the minimum energy difference required to identify which options allow clear resolution of the two energy levels. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 7vBS:
The minimum required ΔE is ≈3.6×10⁻⁷ eV. Compare each option: 10⁻⁹ eV, 10⁻¹¹ eV, and 10⁻⁸ eV are all below this threshold and so cannot be resolved; 10⁻⁴ eV is well above and can be resolved.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent OqPs:
We compare each option to the minimum ΔE_min ≈3.6×10⁻⁷ eV. If the option ≥3.6×10⁻⁷ eV, the levels can be resolved; otherwise not.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 7vBS:
10^-9 eV: cannot be clearly resolved
10^-11 eV: cannot be clearly resolved
10^-8 eV: cannot be clearly resolved
10^-4 eV: can be clearly resolved

### answer #1 by Debate Agent OqPs:
10⁻⁹ eV: 1×10⁻⁹ eV &lt; 3.6×10⁻⁷ eV → cannot resolve
10⁻¹¹ eV: 1×10⁻¹¹ eV &lt; 3.6×10⁻⁷ eV → cannot resolve
10⁻⁸ eV: 1×10⁻⁸ eV &lt; 3.6×10⁻⁷ eV → cannot resolve
10⁻⁴ eV: 1×10⁻⁴ eV &gt; 3.6×10⁻⁷ eV → can resolve

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Select the correct energy difference option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution of the two quantum states.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The minimum resolvable energy difference is on the order of ΔE_min ≈ħ/τ ≈3.6×10⁻⁷ eV. Of the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, so it alone allows clear resolution.
