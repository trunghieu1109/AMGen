Question: Example(question="which of the following molecules has c3h symmetry?\ntriisopropyl borate\nquinuclidine\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", choice1='quinuclidine', choice2='triisopropyl borate\n', choice3="benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone", choice4="triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_8
proposed answer: Based on symmetry analyses from Sub-tasks 2â€“5, none of the listed molecules combines a threefold rotation axis with a horizontal mirror plane without additional symmetry elements (triisopropyl borate is C3/C3v, quinuclidine is C3v, both fused hexaones are D3h). Therefore, no molecule fits C3h.

Answer:None of the given molecules exhibits C3h symmetry.
Extracted answer: None of the given molecules exhibits C3h symmetry.
Correct answer: 3
