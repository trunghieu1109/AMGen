Question: Example(question='Two stars (Star_1 and Star_2) each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of our Sun, respectively. Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n', choice1='~0.8', choice2='~12.6', choice3='~3.9', choice4='~1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_17
proposed answer: The abundance ratio (nSi/nH)_1/(nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is closest to the option ~3.9.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_17
proposed answer: We have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0, so (nSi/nH)_1∝10^{0.3}. For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 ⇒[Si/H]_2=[Mg/H]_2−[Mg/Si]_2=−0.3, so (nSi/nH)_2∝10^{−0.3}. The ratio=(nSi/nH)_1/(nSi/nH)_2=10^{0.3−(−0.3)}=10^{0.6}≈3.98≈3.9, matching choice C.
