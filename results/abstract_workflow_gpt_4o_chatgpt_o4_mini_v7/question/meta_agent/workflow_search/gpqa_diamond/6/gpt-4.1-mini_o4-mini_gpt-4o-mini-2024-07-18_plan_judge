Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_6
proposed answer: The threshold energy for γγ → e⁺e⁻ with a 10⁻³ eV CMB photon is about (mₑc²)²/(2ε) ≃ 1.3×10⁵ GeV. Among the given options, 1.8×10⁵ GeV is the smallest value above this threshold.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_6
proposed answer: Based on the threshold energy for γγ → e⁺e⁻ interactions with CMB photons of ~10⁻³ eV, the corresponding γ-ray energy limit is about 2.6×10⁵ GeV (option C).
