Writing cosθ=x/r, we get V=½k(x^2+y^2)+3/2k x^2=2k x^2+½k y^2. Thus it is a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator separable in x,y with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m). It is invariant under x→−x and y→−y but not under full rotations.; answer: V(r,θ)=½kr^2+3/2kr^2cos^2θ = 2k x^2 + ½k y^2, i.e. V = ½mω_x^2 x^2 + ½mω_y^2 y^2 with ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m). It is an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator, separable in Cartesian coordinates, invariant under reflections x→−x, y→−y but not under continuous rotations.\nCoT-SC agent RtOd, expressing potential in Cartesian coordinates, thinking: We substitute x=r cosθ and y=r sinθ into V(r,θ)=½kr²+3/2kr²cos²θ. Noting r²=x²+y² and cos²θ=x²/r² gives V=½k(x²+y²)+3/2k x²=2k x²+½k y². Comparing with ½mω_x²x²+½mω_y²y² yields ω_x²=4k/m, ω_y²=k/m.; answer: V(x,y)=2k x²+½k y²=½m(2√(k/m))²x²+½m(√(k/m))²y², hence ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m).\nCoT-SC agent sUdM, expressing potential in Cartesian coordinates, thinking: We substitute x=r cosθ, y=r sinθ into V(r,θ). The term r^2 cos^2θ becomes x^2, and r^2 = x^2+y^2, giving V=½k(x^2+y^2)+3/2k x^2=2k x^2+½k y^2. Comparing with ½mω_x^2x^2+½mω_y^2y^2 yields ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m).; answer: V(x,y)=2k x^2+½k y^2, so ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m)\nCoT-SC agent bD3a, expressing potential in Cartesian coordinates, thinking: We substitute x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ into V(r,θ) = ½ k r^2 + 3/2 k r^2 cos^2θ, rewrite cos^2θ = x^2/r^2 and r^2 = x^2 + y^2, then collect terms to identify the coefficients of x^2 and y^2. Comparing with ½ m ω^2 x^2 form gives the effective frequencies.; answer: V(x,y) = ½ k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x^2) = 2 k x^2 + ½ k y^2 = ½ m (ω_x^2 x^2 + ω_y^2 y^2) with ω_x = 2 √(k/m), ω_y = √(k/m).\nCoT agent 8A3n, identifying effective frequencies, thinking: From V(x,y)=2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2 we match 1/2 m ω_x^2 x^2 = 2k x^2 ⇒ ω_x^2=4k/m ⇒ ω_x=2√(k/m), and 1/2 m ω_y^2 y^2=(1/2)k y^2 ⇒ ω_y^2=k/m ⇒ ω_y=√(k/m).; answer: ω_x = 2√(k/m), ω_y = √(k/m)\nCoT agent qGTQ, writing Hamiltonian and recalling energy formula, thinking: The Hamiltonian for a 2D anisotropic oscillator separates into x and y components with different frequencies. The general energy formula is the sum of two independent 1D oscillator energies.; answer: H = p_x^2/(2m) + p_y^2/(2m) + 1/2 m (ω_x^2 x^2 + ω_y^2 y^2)\nE_{n_x,n_y} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\nDebate agent pXTb, round 0, deriving energy spectrum, thinking: We express V(r,θ) in Cartesian: V = 2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2, so 1/2 m ω_x^2 x^2 = 2k x^2 ⇒ ω_x = 2√(k/m), and 1/2 m ω_y^2 y^2 = (1/2)k y^2 ⇒ ω_y = √(k/m). Then use E = (n_x+1/2)ħω_x + (n_y+1/2)ħω_y.; answer: E(n_x,n_y) = (n_x+1/2)ħ·2√(k/m) + (n_y+1/2)ħ·√(k/m) = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)\nDebate agent 5cfs, round 0, deriving energy spectrum, thinking: We rewrite V in Cartesian: V=2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2 = (1/2)m(ω_x^2 x^2 + ω_y^2 y^2) with ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m).
