Then cos^2θ = x^2/r^2, so V becomes a sum of decoupled x and y quadratic terms.; answer: V(r,θ) = ½ k r^2 + 3/2 k r^2 cos^2θ = ½ k (x^2+y^2) + 3/2 k x^2 = 2k x^2 + ½ k y^2 = ½ (4k x^2 + k y^2).  Thus the motion separates into two independent oscillators with spring constants 4k (along x) and k (along y).\nCoT agent giYi, expressing potential in Cartesian coords, thinking: We use x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then V = ½k(r^2) + 3/2 k r^2 cos^2θ = ½k(x^2+y^2) + 3/2 k x^2 = 2k x^2 + ½k y^2 = ½(4k x^2 + k y^2). Thus the motion decouples into two harmonic oscillators with spring constants 4k and k along x and y.; answer: V(x,y) = ½(4k x^2 + k y^2); effective spring constants: k_x = 4k, k_y = k.\nCoT agent xVo6, analyzing frequencies, thinking: From Sub-task 2 we have V(x,y)=½(4k x² + k y²), so k_x=4k and k_y=k. The oscillator frequencies are ω = √(k_eff/m). Thus ω_x=√(4k/m)=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).; answer: ω_x = 2 √(k/m), ω_y = √(k/m)\nCoT agent 8JMP, writing energy spectrum, thinking: For a 2D quantum harmonic oscillator with separable frequencies ω_x and ω_y, the total energy is the sum of energies in each direction.
