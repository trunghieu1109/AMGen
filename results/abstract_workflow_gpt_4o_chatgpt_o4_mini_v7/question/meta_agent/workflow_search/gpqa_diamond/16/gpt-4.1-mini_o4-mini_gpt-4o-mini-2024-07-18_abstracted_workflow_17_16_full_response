The stability constant given (5×10¹⁰) is actually the formation constant; for the dissociation equilibrium we invert it. No data are missing.; answer: Equilibrium: CaEDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\nEquilibrium constant for dissociation: K_Ca–EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [CaEDTA²⁻]\nCoT agent a1IU, defining variables, thinking: We need to assign symbols to the equilibrium concentrations. The initial complex is 0.02 M, which dissociates by amount x to give x of Ca²⁺ and x of EDTA⁴⁻, so complex is 0.02–x. No extra data missing.; answer: Let x = [Ca²⁺]ₑq, y = [EDTA⁴⁻]ₑq, z = [CaEDTA²⁻]ₑq. Since only the complex dissociates: x = y, and z = 0.02 – x.\nCoT-SC agent FEtQ, setting up equilibrium expression, thinking: We define x=[Ca2+]eq, y=[EDTA4-]eq, z=[CaEDTA2-]eq=0.02–x, with x=y. The equilibrium constant expression K=[Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[CaEDTA2-] becomes x·x/(0.02–x).; answer: K_Ca-EDTA = [Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[CaEDTA2-] = x·y/z = x^2/(0.02 − x)\nCoT-SC agent ft3o, setting up equilibrium expression, thinking: We need to use the definitions x = [Ca²⁺]ₑq, y = [EDTA⁴⁻]ₑq, z = [CaEDTA²⁻]ₑq with x = y and z = 0.02 – x. The formation constant is defined as K = [complex]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). Substituting the variables yields the required expression.; answer: K_Ca–EDTA = [CaEDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = z/(x·y). With x = y and z = 0.02 – x, this becomes:\n5×10¹⁰ = (0.02 – x)/x²\nCoT-SC agent 79Jc, setting up equilibrium expression, thinking: We need to express the formation constant K_Ca-EDTA in terms of the equilibrium concentrations x=[Ca2+], y=[EDTA4−], and z=[CaEDTA2−]. Since x=y and z=0.02−x, we substitute these into the definition of K.; answer: K_Ca-EDTA = [CaEDTA2-] / ([Ca2+][EDTA4-]) = z/(x·y) = (0.02 − x)/(x^2)\nCoT-SC agent NM3J, solving equilibrium expression, thinking: We have Kd = [Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[CaEDTA2-] = x^2/(0.02 – x) = 5×10^10. Rearranged: x^2 + Kd·x – 0.02·Kd = 0. Solve quadratic: x = [–Kd + sqrt(Kd^2 + 4·Kd·0.02)]/2. Numerically, Kd = 5×10^10, so sqrt term ≈ 5×10^10 + 0.04, giving x ≈ 0.02 M.; answer: x ≈ 2.0×10^-2 M\nCoT-SC agent nBp4, solving equilibrium expression, thinking: We have K_Ca-EDTA = [Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[CaEDTA2-] = x^2/(0.02–x) = 5×10^10. Rearranging gives x^2 = 5×10^10(0.02–x) → x^2 +5×10^10 x –1×10^9 = 0. Solve with quadratic formula: x = [–5×10^10 + sqrt((5×10^10)^2 +4×1×10^9)]/2 ≈ (–5×10^10 + (5×10^10 +0.04))/2 ≈0.02 M.; answer: D)\nCoT-SC agent 0Imc, solving equilibrium expression, thinking: We have K_Ca-EDTA = [Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[CaEDTA2-] = x^2/(0.02 − x) = 5×10^10. Rearranging gives x^2 = 5×10^10(0.02 − x) = 1×10^9 − 5×10^10 x, or x^2 + 5×10^10 x − 1×10^9 = 0. Solving the quadratic: x = [−5×10^10 ± √((5×10^10)^2 + 4×1×10^9)]/2. The discriminant ≈ (5×10^10)^2 +4×10^9 ≈ (5×10^10)^2 (1+1.6×10^−12), so √ ≈5×10^10 +0.04. The positive root is x ≈ (−5×10^10 + 5×10^10 + 0.04)/2 ≈0.02 M.
