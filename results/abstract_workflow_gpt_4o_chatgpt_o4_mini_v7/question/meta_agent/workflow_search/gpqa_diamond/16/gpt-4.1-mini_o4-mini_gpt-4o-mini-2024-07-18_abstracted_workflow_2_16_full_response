The system includes the complex, its dissociation into Ca2+ and EDTA4–, the equilibrium constant, and conditions (pH, T) that affect speciation.; answer: Relevant species: Ca–EDTA complex, free Ca2+ ion, free EDTA4– ligand. Parameters: [Ca–EDTA]initial = 0.02 M; K_Ca–EDTA = 5×10^10; pH ideal; T = 25 °C. Goal: determine equilibrium [Ca2+] concentration from the dissociation equilibrium.\nCoT agent rU4K, defining equilibrium expression, thinking: We need to write the equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of the Ca–EDTA complex: Ca–EDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4–. The given K_Ca–EDTA is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the dissociation products over the concentration of the complex.; answer: K_Ca–EDTA = [Ca2+][EDTA4–] / [Ca–EDTA] = 5×10^10\nCoT agent UPac, setting equilibrium concentrations, thinking: We can denote the amount of complex that dissociates as x. Initially [Ca–EDTA]=0.02 M, [Ca2+]=[EDTA4–]=0. At equilibrium [Ca–EDTA]=0.02−x, [Ca2+]=x, [EDTA4–]=x, which when plugged into K=[Ca2+][EDTA4–]/[Ca–EDTA] gives the desired relationship.; answer: Let x = concentration of dissociated Ca–EDTA. At equilibrium:\n[Ca2+] = x\n[EDTA4–] = x\n[Ca–EDTA] = 0.02 − x\nSubstitute into K_Ca–EDTA: 5×10^10 = x·x / (0.02 − x) = x^2/(0.02 − x)\nCoT agent wmGl, deriving expression for free Ca2+, thinking: We start from the formation equilibrium constant Kf = [Ca–EDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]). From Sub-task 3: at equilibrium [Ca–EDTA]=C–x, [Ca2+]=x, [EDTA4–]=x. Thus\nKf = (C – x)/(x·x) = (C – x)/x^2.\nRearrange: x^2 = (C – x)/Kf. Since Kf is very large, x ≪ C so C – x ≈ C. Then x ≈ √(C/Kf).; answer: Starting from Kf = (C – x)/x^2, we get\nx^2 = (C – x)/Kf.\nFor large Kf assume x ≪ C so C – x ≈ C. Then the free Ca2+ concentration is\n[Ca2+] = x ≈ √(C/Kf).\nCoT agent gTpr, calculating numerical free Ca2+ concentration, thinking: We derived x=√(C/Kf). Plugging C=0.02\u2009M and Kf=5×10^10 gives x=√(0.02/5×10^10)=√(4×10^−13)=2×10^−6.5≈6.3×10^−7\u2009M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nDebate agent wHTj, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is 6.3×10^−7 M, which exactly matches choice 3 (6.3×10^−7 M).; answer: C)\nDebate agent bMbc, round 0, comparing calculated concentration with choices, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is 6.3×10^−7 M, which exactly matches option C.; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent, selecting closest multiple-choice answer, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration is 6.3×10^−7 M, which exactly matches choice C.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
