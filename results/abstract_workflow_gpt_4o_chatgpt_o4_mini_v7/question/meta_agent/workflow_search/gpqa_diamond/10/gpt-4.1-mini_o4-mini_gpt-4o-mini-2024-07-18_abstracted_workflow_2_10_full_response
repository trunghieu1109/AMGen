This is not a multiple-choice question but a descriptive extraction, so I will provide a complete summary without any missing fields.; answer: SARS-CoV-2 programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) features:\n\n1. Slippery sequence:\n   • Core heptanucleotide motif: U UUA AAC (positions 13,459–13,465 in Wuhan-Hu-1 reference).\n   • Ribosome pauses on this sequence and shifts back by one nucleotide (−1) when encountering a downstream RNA structure.\n\n2. Downstream pseudoknot:\n   • Three-stem H-type pseudoknot located ~6–8 nucleotides downstream of the slippery site.\n   • Provides mechanical resistance to the translocating ribosome, promoting slippage.\n   • Single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals at least two stable folded conformers under tension.\n\n3. Frameshifting efficiency:\n   • In vitro and cellular assays show ~25–30% −1 frameshifting efficiency.\n   • Balances expression of ORF1a (pp1a) and ORF1ab (pp1ab) polyproteins, critical for viral replicase assembly.\n\n4.

Biological significance:\n   • PRF is essential for producing the replication–transcription complex (nsp12–nsp16).\n   • Conserved mechanism across betacoronaviruses suggests a potential antiviral target: small molecules or antisense oligonucleotides that stabilize alternative pseudoknot folds can reduce frameshifting and impair viral replication.\nCoT-SC agent 5N6p, extracting features of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, thinking: The user requests detailed features of SARS-CoV-2 programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting, drawing on known slippery sequence, pseudoknot structure, and comparison with SARS-CoV. Sufficient published data exist to answer without marking [TOO_HARD].; answer: SARS-CoV-2 Programmed −1 Ribosomal Frameshifting (PRF):\n\n1. Slippery Sequence:\n   • Consensus motif: U UUA AAC (positions 13,458–13,464 in the genome).\n   • Mechanism: Allows the ribosome’s P- and A-site tRNAs to realign by slipping back one nucleotide (−1) on the mRNA.\n   • Conservation: Identical heptanucleotide sequence in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, critical for frameshift efficiency (~25–40%).\n\n2. Downstream Pseudoknot:\n   • Architecture: A three-stemmed H-type RNA pseudoknot spanning ~70 nt immediately 3′ of the slippery site.\n   • Mechanical Role: Creates a stable physical barrier that stalls the ribosome and promotes −1 slippage.\n   • Conformational Dynamics: Two major conformers under tension, consistent with single-molecule force spectroscopy data.\n\n3. Frameshift Efficiency:\n   • In Vitro Rates: Typically 25–30% in cell-free systems; similar values observed in SARS-CoV studies.\n   • Modulation: Efficiency depends on pseudoknot stability and dynamics; over-stabilizing or destabilizing reduces frameshifting.\n\n4. Comparison with SARS-CoV:\n   • Sequence Identity: >98% identity in both slippery site and pseudoknot core; only minor loop-region substitutions.\n   • Structural Fold: Cryo-EM and NMR studies show nearly superposable pseudoknot folds, with conserved base triples.\n   • Biophysical Behavior: Both viruses’ pseudoknots exhibit two-stem unfolding intermediates under force and comparable mean unfolding forces (~20–25 pN).\n   • Functional Outcome: Comparable ratios of pp1a to pp1ab polyprotein production, indicating nearly identical translational control.\n\n5. Biological Significance:\n   • Polyprotein Expression: Frameshifting is essential to produce pp1ab (containing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and replicase domains).\n   • Antiviral Target: Small molecules or antisense oligonucleotides that alter pseudoknot stability can reduce frameshifting and viral replication.\nCoT-SC agent 2VLf, extracting features of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, thinking: The user requests detailed features and scientific facts about SARS-CoV-2 –1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, focusing on the slippery sequence, pseudoknot structure, and comparison with SARS-CoV. This is a descriptive task rather than a multiple-choice selection.; answer: SARS-CoV-2 programmed –1 ribosomal frameshifting: 1) Location and purpose: Occurs at the junction of ORF1a/ORF1b near the 5′ end of the ~30\u2009kb genome to produce polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab in a defined ratio essential for viral replicase assembly. 2) Slippery sequence: A conserved heptanucleotide “UUUAAAC” motif where the ribosome’s P- and A-site tRNAs slip back by one nucleotide; the UUU triplet and adjoining AAA support codon-anticodon realignment. 3) Downstream pseudoknot: A three-stem–two-loop H-type pseudoknot ~6–8\u2009nt downstream of the slippery site stalls the ribosome, promoting frameshifting. The pseudoknot features coaxially stacked stems and stabilizing tertiary contacts, yielding high mechanical resistance. 4) Frameshifting efficiency: Typically ~25–30% in vitro (variable by assay conditions), balancing pp1a/pp1ab levels for optimal replication. 5) Comparison with SARS-CoV: The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot sequence differs by only a few nucleotides yet retains the same overall three-stem architecture and base-triple interactions. Single-molecule pulling experiments and cryo-EM data show SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoknots adopt very similar conformations under force and induce comparable frameshifting rates, indicating high structural and functional conservation.\nCoT-SC agent M6D3, extracting features of nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, thinking: The user requests detailed features and known facts about the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN heterodimer focusing on mismatch repair, exonuclease activity, and dsRNA protection. This is a descriptive task requiring summarization of established biochemical and structural insights.; answer: Key features of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN heterodimer:\n\n1. Subunit composition and domains\n   • nsp14: Bifunctional protein with an N-terminal 3′→5′ exonuclease (ExoN) domain and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase domain.\n   • nsp10: Small zinc-binding cofactor that stimulates both ExoN and methyltransferase activities of nsp14.\n\n2. Exonuclease activity and catalytic mechanism\n   • ExoN active site contains a conserved DEDDh motif coordinating two divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+).\n   • Catalyzes removal of misincorporated nucleotides from the 3′ end of nascent viral RNA in a 3′→5′ direction.\n   • Metal-ion–dependent hydrolysis of the phosphodiester backbone underlies the proofreading function.\n\n3. Role of nsp10 cofactor\n   • nsp10 binds the ExoN domain via two interface patches, stabilizing loops around the active site.\n   • Enhances ExoN catalytic efficiency by >30-fold and increases substrate (dsRNA) affinity.\n   • Coordinates a structural zinc ion to maintain the proper fold of nsp10.\n\n4. Mismatch repair mechanism\n   • During RNA synthesis by the polymerase complex (nsp12/nsp7/nsp8), ExoN excises mispaired or aberrant nucleotides back to a matched terminus.\n   • Prevents accumulation of deleterious mutations and increases overall replication fidelity.\n\n5. Protection of dsRNA and innate immune evasion\n   • By removing mismatches, the ExoN domain reduces the generation of error-prone or aberrant dsRNA structures that could be recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (e.g., RIG-I, MDA5).\n   • Thus, the nsp10/nsp14 complex indirectly prevents buildup of immunostimulatory dsRNA and limits activation of innate antiviral responses.\n\n6. Structural insights\n   • High-resolution cryo-EM and X-ray structures show a compact heterodimer with the ExoN active site exposed to bind dsRNA.\n   • nsp10 packs against the ExoN fold, promoting the correct orientation of catalytic residues and metal ions.\n\nOverall, the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN heterodimer forms a robust proofreading complex that excises replication errors, preserves genome integrity, and minimizes dsRNA-mediated host immune activation.\nCoT-SC agent Qcor, extracting features of nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, thinking: The user requests a detailed description of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14‐ExoN heterodimer: its mismatch repair mechanism, exonuclease activity, and how the interaction prevents dsRNA breakdown. We have sufficient knowledge from biochemical and structural studies to provide these details without requesting further information.; answer: Detailed features and known facts about the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN heterodimer complex:\n\n1. Composition and Structure:\n   • nsp14: A bifunctional enzyme with an N-terminal 3′→5′ exonuclease (ExoN) domain and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase domain.\n   • nsp10: A small zinc-binding cofactor (contains two zinc-finger motifs) that binds to nsp14 and markedly enhances ExoN activity.\n   • Heterodimer Interface: nsp10 docks against the ExoN domain of nsp14, stabilizing the active site and proper positioning of catalytic residues.\n\n2. Exonuclease Activity and Catalytic Mechanism:\n   • Catalytic Motif: The ExoN domain harbors a conserved DEDDh motif (Asp90, Glu92, Asp273, His268 in SARS-CoV-2 numbering) that coordinates two metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+).\n   • Metal-Ion Dependence: Two divalent metal ions bridge water molecules for nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester backbone, excising mismatched or aberrant nucleotides from the 3′ end of nascent viral RNA.\n   • Proofreading Function: Removes misincorporated nucleotides introduced by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), enhancing replication fidelity and reducing mutational load.\n\n3. Mismatch Repair Mechanism:\n   • Substrate Recognition: The ExoN active site preferentially binds double-stranded RNA at a duplex junction, sensing distortions due to mismatches.\n   • Excision Cycle: The mismatched nucleotide at the 3′ terminus is cleaved off, then the primer/template is repositioned for elongation by nsp12.\n   • Processivity: nsp10 binding increases the processivity and turnover rate of the exonuclease reaction by stabilizing the RNA substrate and catalytic pocket.\n\n4. Prevention of dsRNA Breakdown and Immune Evasion:\n   • dsRNA Stability: By excising mismatches rather than indiscriminately degrading dsRNA, the complex maintains integrity of replication intermediates.\n   • Immune Modulation: Reduced accumulation of aberrant or long dsRNA species limits activation of host pattern-recognition receptors (e.g., RIG-I, MDA5), dampening interferon responses.\n\n5. Interaction with Other Replication Factors:\n   • Replication–Transcription Complex (RTC): nsp14/nsp10 associates with nsp12 (RdRp), nsp7, and nsp8, coordinating proofreading with RNA synthesis.\n   • Resistance to Nucleoside Analogs: ExoN activity can excise incorporated analogs (e.g., ribavirin, remdesivir), contributing to antiviral resistance.\n\n6. Structural and Functional Implications:\n   • Target for Antivirals: Inhibiting the nsp10/nsp14 interface or ExoN active site offers a strategy to increase viral mutational load and sensitivity to nucleoside inhibitors.\n   • Conservation: The ExoN domain and nsp10 cofactor are highly conserved across beta-coronaviruses, underscoring their essential role in viral propagation.\nCoT-SC agent koo2, extracting features of nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, thinking: The user requests detailed features and known scientific facts about the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 ExoN heterodimer complex, focusing on its mismatch repair mechanism, exonuclease activity, and its role in preventing dsRNA breakdown. This is a descriptive task (not multiple-choice), so the answer will enumerate the complex’s attributes.; answer: Key Features and Scientific Facts about the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 ExoN Heterodimer:\n\n1. Subunit Composition and Interaction:\n   • nsp14: A bifunctional protein with an N-terminal 3′→5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain.\n   • nsp10: A small zinc-binding protein that serves as an essential cofactor for both nsp14 ExoN and nsp16 2′-O-MTase activities.\n   • Heterodimer Formation: nsp10 binds to a surface groove on the ExoN domain of nsp14, reorganizing four key loop regions around the catalytic site and increasing ExoN’s affinity for RNA substrates.\n\n2. Exonuclease Active Site and Catalytic Mechanism:\n   • Catalytic Residues: The ExoN domain contains a conserved DEDD motif (Asp90, Glu92, Glu191, Asp273 in SARS-CoV-2 numbering) and a histidine (His268) that coordinate two Mg2+ ions.\n   • Metal-Ion Dependence: ExoN activity requires two divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for nucleophile activation and stabilization of the transition state during phosphodiester bond hydrolysis.\n   • Mechanism: The 3′-terminal mismatched nucleotide is hydrolyzed by a two-metal–ion mechanism, generating a free 3′-OH end for the viral RdRp to re-incorporate the correct nucleotide.\n\n3. Mismatch Repair Function:\n   • Proofreading During Replication: ExoN excises misincorporated ribonucleotides introduced by the low-fidelity RdRp (nsp12), reducing the error rate ~10- to 20-fold and enabling the large (~30\u2009kb) coronavirus genome size.\n   • Substrate Specificity: Prefers single-stranded RNA with mismatches at the 3′ end; shows reduced activity on perfectly matched duplexes.\n   • Processivity: nsp10 binding increases processivity, allowing multiple successive excision events without full dissociation.\n\n4. Prevention of dsRNA Breakdown and Immune Evasion:\n   • dsRNA Integrity: By selectively removing mismatches rather than degrading long dsRNA, the complex preserves replicative intermediates needed for continued genome synthesis.\n   • Innate Immunity Avoidance: Limiting accumulation of aberrant dsRNA structures reduces detection by host pattern recognition receptors (e.g., MDA5, RIG-I), dampening interferon responses.\n\n5. Structural and Biophysical Insights:\n   • Crystal Structures: High-resolution structures (≤2.5\u2009Å) reveal how nsp10 stabilizes loops L1–L4 around the ExoN active site, enhancing RNA binding and catalysis.\n   • Dynamics: nsp10 binding reduces conformational flexibility in nsp14’s ExoN domain, optimizing positioning of catalytic residues and metal-binding sites.\n\n6. Functional Importance and Therapeutic Potential:\n   • Essential for Viral Fitness: Genetic knockout or catalytic-site mutants of ExoN yield viable but mutator viruses with attenuated growth.\n   • Drug Targeting: Small molecules or peptides disrupting the nsp10–nsp14 interface or chelating the catalytic metal ions hold potential to inhibit proofreading and drive lethal mutagenesis.\nCoT-SC agent UD2w, extracting features of ORF3a apoptosis pathway, thinking: The user asks to extract detailed features and known facts about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a’s role in apoptosis, focusing on caspase-8 activation without Bcl-2 changes and distinguishing extrinsic vs intrinsic pathways. We have sufficient published data to answer directly.; answer: Detailed features and known scientific facts about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a-induced apoptosis:\n\n1) Protein structure and localization:\n   • ORF3a is a 275-amino-acid accessory protein with three transmembrane helices.  \n   • It localizes to endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi apparatus, and the plasma membrane.  \n   • It forms homo-oligomeric ion channels (viroporins) that alter cellular ion homeostasis.\n\n2) Caspase-8 activation:\n   • Expression of ORF3a in host cells leads to cleavage (activation) of initiator caspase-8, producing the active p18 fragment.  \n   • Caspase-8 activation is detected by immunoblotting and activity assays in infected or ORF3a-transfected cells.  \n   • Activated caspase-8 subsequently cleaves effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-7), driving apoptotic morphology (membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation).\n\n3) Bcl-2 expression unchanged:\n   • Levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) remain stable in the presence of ORF3a.  \n   • No significant change in pro-apoptotic BAX/BAK expression or mitochondrial cytochrome c release is observed.  \n   • Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) remains intact, indicating minimal intrinsic pathway engagement.\n\n4) Implication of extrinsic vs. mitochondrial pathways:\n   • Caspase-8 is the hallmark initiator of the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway, activated by DISC formation (e.g., FADD, TRADD recruitment to TNFRSF receptors).  \n   • Unchanged Bcl-2 and mitochondrial integrity argue against primary activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway.  \n   • ORF3a may promote clustering or upregulation of death receptors (Fas, TRAIL-R) or interact with adaptor proteins, favoring extrinsic signaling.\n\n5) Biological consequence:\n   • Extrinsic apoptosis induction by ORF3a may facilitate viral release and immune evasion by killing infected cells.  \n   • The selective activation of the death receptor pathway without intrinsic involvement distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a from other viral pro-apoptotic proteins.\nCoT-SC agent xiWy, extracting features of ORF3a apoptosis pathway, thinking: The user requests detailed features and scientific facts about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a’s role in apoptosis, focusing on caspase-8 activation without Bcl-2 modulation, and implications for extrinsic vs. intrinsic pathways. We have enough published data from in vitro studies showing ORF3a’s activation of death-receptor signaling, caspase-8 cleavage, downstream caspase-3 activation, no change in Bcl-2, no cytochrome c release, indicating predominantly extrinsic pathway. Thus we can answer fully without [TOO_HARD].; answer: SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a Apoptotic Features and Pathway Implications:\n\n1. ORF3a Protein Characteristics:\n   • Accessory protein ~274–275 amino acids, type I transmembrane topology.\n   • Localizes to endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and plasma membrane.\n   • Can form homo-oligomeric ion channels (viroporin) facilitating ion flux.\n\n2. Caspase-8 Activation:\n   • ORF3a expression in mammalian cells (e.g., HEK293T, A549) leads to cleavage/activation of initiator caspase-8.\n   • Evidence: detection of p18 fragment of caspase-8 by Western blot; increased caspase-8 activity in fluorometric assays.\n   • Upstream mechanism: ORF3a increases surface levels or clustering of death receptors (e.g., Fas, TRAIL-R), or recruits adaptor proteins (FADD), promoting DISC formation.\n\n3. Bcl-2 Expression Unchanged:\n   • No significant alteration in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein levels following ORF3a expression.\n   • Lack of Bcl-2 downregulation indicates minimal involvement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).\n\n4. Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Pathway Implications:\n   • Extrinsic pathway hallmark: death-receptor engagement → caspase-8 → caspase-3 cascade → apoptosis.\n   • Intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway hallmark: Bcl-2 family regulation → cytochrome c release → caspase-9 → caspase-3.\n   • ORF3a triggers the extrinsic pathway: robust caspase-8 cleavage, downstream effector caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage; minimal cytochrome c release or caspase-9 activation.\n   • Functional consequence: ORF3a-induced apoptosis is receptor-mediated and Bcl-2-independent, allowing virus to modulate host cell death without engaging mitochondrial checkpoints.\n\n5. Biological and Pathological Significance:\n   • Extrinsic apoptosis may contribute to lymphopenia and tissue damage observed in COVID-19.\n   • ORF3a-induced death may facilitate viral release or immune evasion by killing immune effector cells.\n\nIn summary, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a acts as a viroporin that specifically activates the death-receptor (extrinsic) apoptotic pathway via caspase-8 cleavage, while leaving Bcl-2 (and thus the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway) unaltered.\nCoT-SC agent FDOx, extracting features of ORF3a apoptosis pathway, thinking: The user requests detailed features and known scientific facts about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a’s role in apoptosis, focusing on caspase-8 activation without Bcl-2 modulation and the distinction between extrinsic and mitochondrial pathways. This information is available from published studies showing ORF3a engages death receptor signaling, leading to caspase-8 cleavage, and does not alter Bcl-2 levels, indicating that the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway is not involved. ; answer: Detailed features and known scientific facts about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a’s role in apoptosis: 1. ORF3a accessory protein: a 275-amino-acid viroporin expressed in infected cells. 2. Caspase-8 activation: ORF3a expression leads to cleavage and activation of initiator caspase-8, a hallmark of extrinsic (death-receptor) apoptotic pathway. 3. Bcl-2 expression unchanged: Levels of the antiapoptotic mitochondrial regulator Bcl-2 remain constant upon ORF3a expression, indicating no engagement of the intrinsic pathway. 4. Extrinsic pathway engagement: ORF3a likely interacts with or up-regulates death receptors (e.g., Fas, TRAIL receptors) or adapter proteins (e.g., FADD) to recruit and activate procaspase-8. 5. Mitochondrial pathway exclusion: Because Bcl-2 and other intrinsic markers (e.g., cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation) are not modulated, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is not induced by ORF3a. 6. Biological implication: ORF3a-driven extrinsic apoptosis may aid viral release or immune evasion by triggering controlled host cell death without the broader inflammatory signals associated with intrinsic apoptosis.\nCoT-SC agent BBP0, extracting features of frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations, thinking: The user requests a detailed extraction of features regarding frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations in SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV-2, which is a descriptive (non‐multiple‐choice) task. I will summarize known scientific findings about the number of conformations under tension and their linear correlation with −1 frameshift efficiency.; answer: Sub-task 5: In both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the −1 ribosomal frameshift signal pseudoknot can adopt two distinct conformations when subjected to mechanical tension (as measured by single-molecule force spectroscopy). One conformation is mechanically more stable (higher unfolding force), and the other is less stable (lower unfolding force). The relative population of these two states correlates linearly with the measured frameshifting efficiency in vitro: a higher fraction of the mechanically stable conformation yields a higher −1 frameshift rate. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots exhibit very similar unfolding forces (roughly 45–50\u2009pN for the stable state) and comparable frameshifting efficiencies (on the order of 15–30%), demonstrating that conformational heterogeneity under tension is a key determinant of frameshifting efficiency in both viruses.\nCoT-SC agent DjUU, extracting features of frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations, thinking: The question asks for detailed features about the relationship between frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Based on published optical‐tweezers and biochemical studies, both pseudoknots adopt two mechanically distinct conformers under tension, and the degree of conformational heterogeneity correlates linearly with −1 PRF efficiency. Although exact unfolding forces and fractional populations vary slightly between the two viruses, the overall two‐state behavior and linear correlation hold. No critical information is missing to provide a concise summary.; answer: For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: 1) The −1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) pseudoknot adopts two distinct conformations when subjected to mechanical tension mimicking ribosomal pulling. 2) Each conformer has a characteristic mechanical stability (two unfolding force peaks observed in single‐molecule optical tweezers). 3) The relative populations of these two conformers (i.e., conformational heterogeneity) are linearly correlated with in vitro −1 PRF efficiency (higher heterogeneity → higher frameshifting rate; correlation coefficients R2\u2009>\u20090.9). 4) Both viruses display similar overall frameshifting efficiencies (~20–30% in reporter assays) owing to their two‐state pseudoknot behavior, though small differences in unfolding forces and population distributions have been measured between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.\nCoT-SC agent 7yCH, extracting features of frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations, thinking: The user requests detailed features about the relationship between frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Published optical‐tweezers and biochemical studies report that both viruses’ −1 PRF pseudoknots adopt two distinct conformers under tension and that the fraction of molecules in each state correlates linearly with frameshifting efficiency, so I can answer fully without needing extra information.; answer: Detailed features of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift pseudoknot conformations and their correlation with −1 PRF efficiency:\n\n1. Number of conformations under tension:\n   • Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 −1 PRF pseudoknots adopt two mechanically distinct conformers when probed by single‐molecule force spectroscopy (optical tweezers).\n   • These two states correspond to different tertiary contacts: a ‘‘threaded’’ conformation and an ‘‘unthreaded’’ conformation of the 5′ end through the pseudoknot fold.\n\n2. Mechanical signatures:\n   • Unfolding force peaks are observed at ~15 pN (less stable conformer) and ~29 pN (more stable conformer) for SARS-CoV.\n   • SARS-CoV-2 shows similar dual peaks, with minor shifts (e.g. ~14 pN and ~27 pN) reflecting subtle sequence differences.\n\n3. Population distribution:\n   • Approximately 50–60% of molecules occupy the low‐force (unthreaded) state and 40–50% occupy the high‐force (threaded) state under physiological ionic conditions.\n   • SARS-CoV-2 tends to have a slightly higher fraction in the high‐force state than SARS-CoV.\n\n4. Correlation with frameshifting efficiency:\n   • A linear relationship exists between the number of conformational states and −1 PRF efficiency: pseudoknots that sample more distinct states yield higher frameshifting rates.\n   • SARS-CoV pseudoknot frameshifting efficiency is ~15%, matching its conformer distribution.\n   • SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot shows ~20–25% −1 PRF, reflecting its altered conformer populations and slightly different mechanical stabilities.\n\n5. Functional implication:\n   • Conformational heterogeneity stalls the ribosome at the slippery site, increasing the probability of −1 slippage.\n   • Modulating the pseudoknot’s ability to interconvert between states tunes the pp1a/pp1ab expression ratio, critical for viral replication complex assembly.\nCoT agent vBzG, evaluating choice1 correctness, thinking: Choice1 describes the key features of SARS-CoV-2 −1 ribosomal frameshifting—a slippery heptamer, a downstream pseudoknot, and production of two polyproteins—and states that its overall conformation is mostly the same as SARS-CoV. Established structural and biochemical studies confirm that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same −1 frameshifting mechanism as SARS-CoV, with very similar three-stemmed pseudoknot folds and slippery sequences, despite minor loop and base-pair differences. Therefore, the statement in choice1 is accurate.; answer: The statement in choice1 is correct.\nCoT agent zKpt, evaluating choice2 correctness, thinking: The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex in SARS-CoV-2 functions as a 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease: nsp14’s N-terminal ExoN domain requires nsp10 as an essential cofactor to excise misincorporated nucleotides and enhance replication fidelity. It does not serve to ‘prevent the breakdown of dsRNA’; rather, it degrades mismatches at the 3′ end of nascent RNA strands. Therefore, the claim that the heterodimer ‘prevents the breakdown of dsRNA’ is incorrect.; answer: The statement in choice2 is incorrect.\nCoT agent faZf, evaluating choice3 correctness, thinking: ORF3a does activate caspase-8, but published studies also report modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins and engagement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (caspase-9 activation), so it’s not solely extrinsic nor leaves Bcl-2 unchanged.; answer: The statement in choice 3 is not fully accurate. While SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a does trigger caspase-8 activation (extrinsic pathway), it also influences Bcl-2 family protein levels and engages the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, so apoptosis is not exclusively via the extrinsic route and Bcl-2 expression can be affected.\nCoT agent a9bL, evaluating choice4 correctness, thinking: Established single-molecule and mechanical unfolding studies show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots adopt two distinct conformers under tension and that increased conformational plasticity (the ability to fluctuate between states) correlates with higher −1 frameshifting efficiency. However, the correlation is with the degree of structural dynamics rather than simply the number of conformations, and there is no evidence of a strict linear relationship between frameshifting rate and conformation count alone. Thus, the statement in choice4 is oversimplified and not fully accurate.; answer: Choice4 is incorrect.\nDebate agent 5MSv, round 0, debating incorrect statement, thinking: Sub-task evaluations: choice1 is correct; choices2, 3, and 4 are incorrect according to the detailed analyses. Therefore, the statements that are false are choices 2, 3, and 4.; answer: B), C), D)\nDebate agent i8Or, round 0, debating incorrect statement, thinking: Evaluation of the four statements indicates that choices 2, 3, and 4 all contain inaccuracies. Because the original question implies there is a single false statement, this conflict makes it unclear which choice the question intends as the sole incorrect one.; answer: B)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease clarify which single statement is meant to be false or provide additional context, as multiple choices appear incorrect based on current evidence.\nFinal Decision agent, deciding incorrect statement, thinking: Evaluation of the four statements suggests that choices 2, 3, and 4 each contain elements that contradict current structural and functional data, yet the original question implies a single false statement. This mismatch indicates insufficient context to pinpoint exactly which one the question setter intended as the sole incorrect answer.; answer: B)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease clarify which specific experimental findings or structural references for the nsp10/nsp14 exonuclease complex should be used to identify it as the single false statement, or break the task into more focused sub-questions on individual protein functions.', iteration_idx=-1)]
