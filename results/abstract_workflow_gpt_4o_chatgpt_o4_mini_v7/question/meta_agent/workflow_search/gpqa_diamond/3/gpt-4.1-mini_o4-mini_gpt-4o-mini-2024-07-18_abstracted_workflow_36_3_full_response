This is straightforward; no additional data is needed.; answer: Standard Maxwell’s equations in classical electromagnetism (differential and integral forms):\n\n1. Gauss’s law for electricity (not magnetic but for completeness):\n   Differential: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀\n   Integral: ∮_∂V E·dA = Q_enc/ε₀\n\n2. Gauss’s law for magnetism:\n   Differential: ∇·B = 0\n   Integral: ∮_∂V B·dA = 0\n\n3. Faraday’s law of induction (electric field circulation):\n   Differential: ∇×E = –∂B/∂t\n   Integral: ∮_C E·dl = –d/dt ∫_S B·dA\n\n4. Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B):\n   Differential: ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n   Integral: ∮_C B·dl = μ₀ I_enc + μ₀ε₀ d/dt ∫_S E·dA\nCoT agent 90nZ, defined magnetic monopoles and their impact, thinking: The user asks to define magnetic monopoles and explain how their existence modifies Maxwell’s equations, focusing on magnetic field terms. This is straightforward and no extra data is needed.; answer: Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles that carry a net magnetic charge (either “north” or “south”), analogous to electric charges for the electric field. In classical electromagnetism it is assumed that no isolated magnetic charges exist, so magnetic field lines always form closed loops and ∇·B=0. If magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell’s equations must be modified to include a magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m. In differential form (SI units) the modified equations become:\n\n1. Gauss’s law for magnetism (with monopoles):\n   ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρ_m  \n   (instead of ∇·B = 0)\n\n2. Faraday’s law (with magnetic currents):\n   ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – J_m  \n   (instead of ∇×E = –∂B/∂t)\n\nThe other two Maxwell equations for the electric field and the curl of B remain as:\n   ∇·E = ρ_e/ε₀\n   ∇×B = μ₀\u2009J_e + μ₀ε₀\u2009∂E/∂t\n\nThese additions restore symmetry between electric and magnetic sources and remove the assumption that magnetic field lines must be source-free.\nCoT agent hS8F, applied magnetic monopole transformation, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m, which modify exactly those Maxwell equations involving the magnetic field divergence (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and the curl of the electric field (Faraday’s law). The other two equations remain unchanged.; answer: The modified Maxwell’s equations (SI units), including electric charge density ρ_e, electric current J_e, magnetic charge density ρ_m, and magnetic current J_m, are:\n\n1. Gauss’s law for electricity (unchanged):\n   ∇·E = ρ_e/ε₀\n\n2. Gauss’s law for magnetism (modified):\n   ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρ_m\n   (instead of ∇·B = 0)\n\n3. Faraday’s law of induction (modified):\n   ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – J_m\n   (instead of ∇×E = –∂B/∂t)\n\n4. Ampère–Maxwell law (unchanged):\n   ∇×B = μ₀\u2009J_e + μ₀ε₀\u2009∂E/∂t\n\nAltered equations: (2) Gauss’s law for magnetism and (3) Faraday’s law.\nCoT agent xotZ, assessed impact on magnetic field equations, thinking: Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density ρ_m to Gauss’s law for magnetism, but does not affect the Ampère–Maxwell law (the curl of B).; answer: Divergence of B (Gauss’s law for magnetism) is modified to ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρ_m. Curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell law) remains ∇×B = μ₀\u2009J_e + μ₀ε₀\u2009∂E/∂t (unchanged).\nCoT agent rzvy, analyzed and classified equation differences, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density term only into Gauss’s law for magnetism. Neither the Ampère–Maxwell law (curl B) nor Faraday’s law (curl E/circulation of E) acquires extra terms from magnetic monopoles.; answer: Only the divergence of the magnetic field equation (Gauss’s law for magnetism) is modified (∇·B = μ₀ρₘ); both the curl of the magnetic field (Ampère–Maxwell law) and the circulation of the electric field (Faraday’s law) remain unchanged.\nDebate agent YG3W, round 0, comparing classification with choices, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a term only in Gauss's law for magnetism (∇·B), so only the divergence of the magnetic field equation is modified.; answer: A)\nDebate agent FZDv, round 0, comparing classification with choices, thinking: Magnetic monopoles modify only Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B), leaving curl B and curl E unchanged.
