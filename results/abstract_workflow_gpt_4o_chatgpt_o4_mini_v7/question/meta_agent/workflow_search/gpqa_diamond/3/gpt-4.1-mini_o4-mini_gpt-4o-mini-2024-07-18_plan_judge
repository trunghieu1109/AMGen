Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Magnetic monopoles require a nonzero ∇·B term and add a magnetic current term in Faraday’s law (∇×E). Choice C exactly names those two equations; A only names ∇·B; B misidentifies ∇×B instead of ∇×E; D names unrelated laws.

Answer:1) C: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field (correct and complete modification).
2) A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field (partial—misses the modified Faraday’s law).
3) B: The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field (incorrect—curl of B is unaffected).
4) D: The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field (irrelevant).
Extracted answer: 1) C: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field (correct and complete modification).
Correct answer: 2

proposed answer: Magnetic monopoles introduce a source term only in Gauss’s law for magnetism (the divergence of B), leaving all other Maxwell equations unchanged. This matches choice1.
