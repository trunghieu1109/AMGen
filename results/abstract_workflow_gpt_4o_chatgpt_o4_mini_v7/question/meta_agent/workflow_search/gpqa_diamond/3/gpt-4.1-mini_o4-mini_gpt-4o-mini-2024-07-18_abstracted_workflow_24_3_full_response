The prioritization of choice 3 as the best answer is accurate. Limitations: the analysis does not present the explicit form of the additional source term in Faraday’s law, omits discussion of consistency with charge conservation and the dual symmetry of Maxwell’s equations, and does not address unit conventions or potential gauge‐choice issues.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Evaluate and prioritize the choices based on accuracy and completeness to ensure the final answer correctly reflects the impact of magnetic monopoles on Maxwell\'s equations.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents="CoT agent IrHm, restating classical Maxwell's equations, thinking: The user asks to restate the classical Maxwell’s equations focusing on the magnetic field equations, which are Gauss’s law for magnetism and the Ampère–Maxwell law.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism (magnetic divergence): ∇·B = 0; Ampère–Maxwell law (magnetic curl): ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t.\nCoT agent TwPR, defining transformation rule for magnetic monopoles, thinking: To include magnetic monopoles one adds magnetic charge and current densities and enforces a duality rotation.  The key is introducing ρₘ and Jₘ so that Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law pick up source terms, and there is a symmetry (duality) mixing electric and magnetic fields and charges.  This is standard in symmetric Maxwell theory.; answer: With isolated magnetic charges ρₘ and currents Jₘ, Maxwell’s equations become (in SI units):\n1) ∇·E = ρₑ/ε₀\n2) ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρₘ\n3) ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀\u2009Jₘ\n4) ∇×B = μ₀\u2009Jₑ + μ₀ε₀\u2009∂E/∂t\n\nThe implied duality (charge–field rotation) is: for any angle θ,\nE′ = E\u2009cosθ + cB\u2009sinθ,\ncB′ = -E\u2009sinθ + cB\u2009cosθ,\nρₑ′ = ρₑ\u2009cosθ + c\u2009ρₘ\u2009sinθ,\nc\u2009ρₘ′ = -ρₑ\u2009sinθ + c\u2009ρₘ\u2009cosθ,\nJₑ′ = Jₑ\u2009cosθ + c\u2009Jₘ\u2009sinθ,\nc\u2009Jₘ′ = -Jₑ\u2009sinθ + c\u2009Jₘ\u2009cosθ.\nFor θ=π/2 this swaps E→cB, B→–E, ρₑ→cρₘ, ρₘ→–ρₑ, Jₑ→cJₘ, Jₘ→–Jₑ, leaving the symmetric Maxwell system invariant.\nCoT agent 0Ypb, generating modified Maxwell's equations, thinking: To include magnetic monopoles, we introduce magnetic charge density ρₘ and current density Jₘ as additional sources. This modifies Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law by adding source terms, while keeping the other two equations structurally unchanged.; answer: The modified Maxwell’s equations in SI units are:\n\n1) Divergence of electric field (Gauss’s law for electricity):\n∇·E = ρₑ / ε₀\n\n2) Divergence of magnetic field (Gauss’s law for magnetism with monopoles):\n∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ\n\n3) Curl of electric field (Faraday’s law with magnetic current):\n∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ Jₘ\n\n4) Curl of magnetic field (Ampère–Maxwell law):\n∇×B = μ₀ Jₑ + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\nCoT-SC agent CSzE, comparing equations, thinking: To identify differences due to magnetic monopoles, compare the classical and modified forms of Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B). Only the divergence equation acquires a monopole source term; the curl equation remains unchanged.; answer: The divergence of the magnetic field law is modified from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ, while the curl of the magnetic field law remains ∇×B = μ₀ Jₑ + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged).\nCoT-SC agent bTcQ, comparing equations, thinking: Including magnetic monopoles introduces a source term in Gauss’s law for magnetism but leaves Ampère–Maxwell’s law (curl of B) structurally unchanged. Thus only the divergence equation for B differs when monopoles are present.; answer: Classical: ∇·B = 0\nModified: ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ\n\nClassical and modified curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell law):\n∇×B = μ₀ Jₑ + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged)\nCoT-SC agent KWrQ, comparing equations, thinking: Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a source term to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=μ0ρm), while Ampère’s law (∇×B=μ0J_e+μ0ε0∂E/∂t) stays unchanged. Thus only the divergence of B equation differs.; answer: A)\nCoT-SC agent 6t49, evaluating electric field equations, thinking: The modified Maxwell’s equations show that only Faraday’s law (the curl of E) acquires an extra source term from magnetic current density Jₘ. Gauss’s law for electricity remains the same since magnetic monopoles do not directly introduce electric charge.; answer: Yes. Gauss’s law for electricity (∇·E = ρₑ/ε₀) is unaffected by magnetic monopoles, but Faraday’s law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) is modified to ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ to include the magnetic current term.\nCoT-SC agent VrPK, evaluating electric field equations, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density ρₘ and current Jₘ. In the modified equations only the Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (∇×E) gain new source terms. The electric‐field divergence equation (Gauss’s law for electricity) and the Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B) remain unchanged. Thus among the two purely electric‐field equations, only the curl of E is modified by monopole current.; answer: Only Faraday’s law (the curl of E) is affected by magnetic monopoles; Gauss’s law for electricity remains unchanged.\nCoT-SC agent zsdh, evaluating electric field equations, thinking: The introduction of magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density ρₘ and current Jₘ. Gauss’s law for electricity (∇·E=ρₑ/ε₀) has no dependence on magnetic sources, so it remains unchanged. Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t) acquires an extra term −μ₀Jₘ, so it is modified.; answer: Gauss’s law for electricity (∇·E=ρₑ/ε₀) is unchanged; Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t) is modified to ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−μ₀Jₘ.\nDebate agent hvkM, round 0, matching differences to choices, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a source term in Gauss’s law for magnetism (div B) and a magnetic current term in Faraday’s law (curl E). That matches choice 3: circulation of the electric field and divergence of the magnetic field.; answer: C)\nDebate agent OaCI, round 0, matching differences to choices, thinking: We have two modifications: Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday’s law (curl of E) both acquire monopole terms. The choice matching these is the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 2Eed, round 0, matching differences to choices, thinking: With magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) gains a source term and Faraday’s law (∇×E) gains a magnetic current term; the other equations remain unchanged.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 1X1q, round 0, matching differences to choices, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a source term in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) and add a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law (∇×E). No other Maxwell equations change. Thus the differences are in the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent on choice selection, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero source term in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) and a magnetic current term in Faraday’s law (∇×E), matching the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.; answer: C)\nReflexion CoT agent bA1y, evaluating and prioritizing choices, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero divergence of B (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and a magnetic current term in Faraday’s law (curl E).
