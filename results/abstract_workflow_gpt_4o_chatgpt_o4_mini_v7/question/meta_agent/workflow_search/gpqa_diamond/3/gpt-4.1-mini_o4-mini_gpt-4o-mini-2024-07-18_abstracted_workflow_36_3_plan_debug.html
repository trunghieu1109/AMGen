    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compare the classification results from Sub-task 5 with the provided multiple-choice options to identify which choice correctly describes the equations that differ in the parallel universe scenario with magnetic monopoles. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YG3W:
Magnetic monopoles introduce a term only in Gauss&#39;s law for magnetism (∇·B), so only the divergence of the magnetic field equation is modified.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent FZDv:
Magnetic monopoles modify only Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B), leaving curl B and curl E unchanged. This matches choice1, i.e., only the divergence of the magnetic field equation is different.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ACOd:
Only Gauss’s law for magnetism (the divergence of B) is modified by magnetic monopoles; neither the curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell law) nor the circulation of E (Faraday’s law) changes.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent T8Ce:
Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density term only into Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B), leaving the curl equations unchanged.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent YG3W:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent FZDv:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent ACOd:
A)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent T8Ce:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on which choice correctly describes the equations that differ.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
