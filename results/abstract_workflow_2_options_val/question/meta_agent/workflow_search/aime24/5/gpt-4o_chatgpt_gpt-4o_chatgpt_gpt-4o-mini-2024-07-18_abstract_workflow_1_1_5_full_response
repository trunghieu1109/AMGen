These side lengths suggest a symmetric configuration. In fact, these lengths are consistent with a configuration where the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to an internal point I, such that the distances from I to each face are equal. This symmetry implies that the tetrahedron is isosceles with respect to the pairs of opposite edges. The given lengths satisfy the triangle inequalities for each face of the tetrahedron, confirming that such a tetrahedron can exist. The symmetry and equal distances from I to the faces suggest that the tetrahedron is a special type, possibly a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal, which is consistent with the given side lengths.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent oTuF:\nThe side lengths are consistent with a symmetric tetrahedron configuration, possibly a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on Sub-task 1 output, determine the geometric properties of the tetrahedron, such as its volume and face areas. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Dakj:\nThe given tetrahedron has a symmetric structure where opposite edges are equal, suggesting it is a disphenoid. For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula for a tetrahedron with edge lengths a, a, b, b, c, c. In this case, a = \\sqrt{41}, b = \\sqrt{80}, c = \\sqrt{89}. The volume V of the tetrahedron can be computed using the Cayley-Menger determinant, but due to the symmetry, a simplified formula can be used: V = \\frac{\\sqrt{(4a^2b^2c^2 - a^4 - b^4 - c^4)}}{12}. Using the given edge lengths, we find the volume V. The face areas can be calculated using Heron\'s formula for each triangular face. For example, the area of triangle ABC with sides \\sqrt{41}, \\sqrt{80}, \\sqrt{89} can be found by first computing the semi-perimeter s = \\frac{\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89}}{2} and then using Heron\'s formula: Area = \\sqrt{s(s - \\sqrt{41})(s - \\sqrt{80})(s - \\sqrt{89})}. The same process can be repeated for the other faces ABD, ACD, and BCD, which have the same side lengths due to symmetry, so they all have the same area. Therefore, the tetrahedron has equal face areas and a volume that can be calculated using the symmetric edge length formula.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Dakj:\nThe tetrahedron is a disphenoid with equal face areas and volume V = \\frac{\\sqrt{(4 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 80 \\cdot 89 - 41^2 - 80^2 - 89^2)}}{12}.

The tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning all four faces are congruent triangles with side lengths \\( \\sqrt{41}, \\sqrt{80}, \\sqrt{89} \\). First, we calculate the area of one face using Heron\'s formula. The semi-perimeter s of one face is \\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89}}{2} \\). The area of one face is \\( \\sqrt{s(s - \\sqrt{41})(s - \\sqrt{80})(s - \\sqrt{89})} \\). Since there are four faces, the total surface area A is 4 times the area of one face. The volume V of the tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid: \\( V = \\frac{\\sqrt{(4a^2b^2c^2 - a^4 - b^4 - c^4)}}{12} \\), where \\( a = \\sqrt{41}, b = \\sqrt{80}, c = \\sqrt{89} \\). Substituting these into the inradius formula gives us the inradius in terms of the given side lengths. After calculating, we find that the inradius is \\( \\frac{6\\sqrt{30}}{41} \\). However, this calculation needs to be verified for correctness, as previous attempts have shown inconsistencies.

From the previous sub-tasks, we have calculated the inradius of the tetrahedron as \\( \\frac{6\\sqrt{30}}{41} \\). Here, \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 30 \\), and \\( p = 41 \\).

Next, we check if \\( n = 30 \\) is square-free. A number is square-free if it is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. The prime factorization of 30 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\), and none of these primes are repeated, so 30 is square-free.
