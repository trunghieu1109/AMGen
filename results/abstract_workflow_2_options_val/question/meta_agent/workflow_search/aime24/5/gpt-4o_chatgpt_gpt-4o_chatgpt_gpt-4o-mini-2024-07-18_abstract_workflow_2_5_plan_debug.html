    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

### Sub-task 5: Express the inradius in the form m * sqrt(n) / p and identify m, n, and p. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent aS0n:
The inradius of a tetrahedron can be expressed in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are integers, \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. From the previous sub-task, we found that the inradius is \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{14} \). This expression is already in the desired form, where \( m = 3 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( p = 14 \). These values satisfy the conditions: \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the inradius is correctly expressed as \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{14} \) with \( m = 3 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( p = 14 \).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent aS0n:
m = 3, n = 3, p = 14

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum m + n + p. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum m + n + p. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the previous sub-task, we have determined that the inradius of the tetrahedron is expressed as \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{14} \), where \( m = 3 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( p = 14 \). These values satisfy the conditions that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. To find the sum \( m + n + p \), we simply add these values together: \( 3 + 3 + 14 = 20 \).
