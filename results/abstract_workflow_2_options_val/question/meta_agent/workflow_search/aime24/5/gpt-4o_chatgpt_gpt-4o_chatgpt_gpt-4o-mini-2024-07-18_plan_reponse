We need to compute the sum \\( m + n + p \\). Since \\( m \\) and \\( p \\) are relatively prime (the greatest common divisor of 6 and 41 is 1), and \\( n = 30 \\) is square-free (its prime factorization is 2 \\times 3 \\times 5, with no repeated factors), the expression is already in the correct form. Therefore, the sum is \\( 6 + 30 + 41 = 77 \\). This calculation is consistent with the requirements that \\( m \\) and \\( p \\) are coprime and \\( n \\) is not divisible by the square of any prime, confirming the correctness of the expression and the sum.\n\nAnswer:77",
