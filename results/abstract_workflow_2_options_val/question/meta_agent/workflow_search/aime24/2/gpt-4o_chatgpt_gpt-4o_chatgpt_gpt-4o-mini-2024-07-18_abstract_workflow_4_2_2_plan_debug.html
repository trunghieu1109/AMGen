    <pre>Related original question:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?.

### Sub-task 7: Make a final decision on the final probability. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent tAvE:
The probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is calculated by considering the number of invariant colorings under rotation. There are 256 total colorings (since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue, giving 2^8 = 256 total colorings). The number of colorings that are invariant under rotation is 32, as determined by considering the symmetries of the octagon and the requirement that the blue vertices can be rotated into the positions of the red vertices. Therefore, the probability is 32/256, which simplifies to 1/8. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 1 and 8 are relatively prime. Thus, the probability is expressed as m/n where m = 1 and n = 8. The sum m+n is 1+8, which equals 9.

### answer by Final Decision Agent tAvE:
9

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Determine the sum m+n from the expression obtained in subtask_7. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 8: Determine the sum m+n from the expression obtained in subtask_7. and explaination.</pre>
