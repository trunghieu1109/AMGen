    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Simplify the expression for AP to the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent AuNB:
The expression for AP given in Sub-task 4 is \( \frac{63}{11} \). To simplify this expression, we need to ensure that the numerator and the denominator are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. The number 63 can be factored into prime factors as \( 3^2 \times 7 \), and 11 is a prime number. Since 11 is not a factor of 63, the greatest common divisor of 63 and 11 is 1. Therefore, the fraction \( \frac{63}{11} \) is already in its simplest form, with 63 and 11 being relatively prime. Thus, the expression for AP is already simplified as \( \frac{63}{11} \), where \( m = 63 \) and \( n = 11 \).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent AuNB:
74

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n from the simplified expression of AP. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n from the simplified expression of AP. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From Sub-task 5, we have the simplified expression for AP as \( \frac{63}{11} \), where \( m = 63 \) and \( n = 11 \). To find \( m + n \), we simply add these two numbers together: \( 63 + 11 = 74 \). Therefore, the value of \( m + n \) is 74.
