Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we have the simplified expression for AP as \( \frac{63}{11} \), where \( m = 63 \) and \( n = 11 \). To find \( m + n \), we simply add these two numbers together: \( 63 + 11 = 74 \). Therefore, the value of \( m + n \) is 74.

proposed answer: To solve for AP, we need to use the power of a point theorem: DA * DP = 81. We previously found that AD = 9/sqrt(2) using geometric properties. Substituting into the equation, DP = 81 / (9/sqrt(2)) = 9sqrt(2). Therefore, AP = DP - AD = 9sqrt(2) - 9/sqrt(2). Simplifying, AP = 18 - 9/2 = 27/2. Thus, AP is in the form m/n where m = 27 and n = 2, which are relatively prime. Hence, m + n = 27 + 2 = 29.
