Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves the excitation ratio of iron atoms in two stars under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which follows the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in a specific excited state between star_1 and star_2 is given by:

N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1))

Given that N1/N2 = 2, taking the natural logarithm yields:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

This can be algebraically rearranged as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)

Since ΔE/k is a positive constant, the temperature-dependent part is (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). The problem's candidate equations omit the constant factor ΔE/k, presumably for simplification or normalization purposes, focusing on the functional form relating T1 and T2.

Among the candidate equations:
- Choice 1: ln(2) = T2 / T1 (incorrect form, no difference or reciprocal of temperatures)
- Choice 2: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)^2 (incorrect denominator, squared term not consistent with Boltzmann relation)
- Choice 3: ln(2) = (T1 + T2) / (T1 * T2) (sum instead of difference, inconsistent with difference of reciprocals)
- Choice 4: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2) (matches the derived expression exactly)

Therefore, choice 4 correctly represents the relationship between the effective temperatures T1 and T2 consistent with the observed excitation ratio and the Boltzmann distribution under LTE. This conclusion holds for all positive absolute temperatures (Kelvin) and assumes the LTE condition is valid. The other choices do not match the physical and algebraic form derived from the problem's conditions.
