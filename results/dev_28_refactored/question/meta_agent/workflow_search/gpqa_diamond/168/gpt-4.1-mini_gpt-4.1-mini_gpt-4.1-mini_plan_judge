Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V is a four-body decay, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles because the total decay energy Q is shared among multiple particles, allowing a continuous range of energy distributions. The endpoint Q represents the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M, reducing the number of emitted particles to three (2E and M). Since the decay still involves more than two particles, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous; a discrete spectrum would only arise in a strict two-body decay where kinematics fixes the energies sharply. The massless nature of M means it can carry away energy without rest mass constraints, potentially allowing the E particles to have more energy on average, thus increasing the endpoint energy beyond Q. The shape of the spectrum will also adjust due to the different kinematics and phase space available with one massless particle instead of two massive ones. This reasoning aligns with conservation of energy and momentum and known principles of multi-body decay kinematics. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape and the endpoint increases. Options suggesting a discrete spectrum or a decreased endpoint contradict fundamental principles of decay kinematics and energy conservation.
