Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2, we use the relationship derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes of the stars in each binary system. Both systems are eclipsing binaries, so we assume their orbital inclinations are close to 90°, making sin(i) approximately 1, which allows us to use the observed radial velocity amplitudes as true orbital velocities. The total mass M of a binary system is proportional to the orbital period P multiplied by the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2), i.e., M ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3. For system_1, the period P1 is 2 years, and the sum of radial velocity amplitudes is 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s. For system_2, the period P2 is 1 year, and the sum of radial velocity amplitudes is 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s. Calculating the ratio of total masses: M1/M2 = (P1 * 15^3) / (P2 * 25^3) = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625) = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Among the given options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), 0.4 is the closest. This calculation assumes circular orbits and similar inclinations due to eclipses, which is reasonable given the sinusoidal radial velocity curves and eclipsing nature of the systems. Alternative assumptions such as different inclinations or eccentricities would not drastically change this ratio. Therefore, the best supported answer is choice A) ~ 0.4.
