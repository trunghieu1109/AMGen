proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). We analyze the energy levels by evaluating the sum of pairwise products for each configuration. When all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum is 3, and the energy is E = -3J. There are exactly 2 such configurations. For all other configurations, the sum of pairwise products is -1, so the energy is E = +J, with 6 such configurations. The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-βE}, which can be grouped by energy levels and their degeneracies: Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Comparing this derived expression with the four given options: Option A matches exactly in both coefficients and exponents. Options B, C, and D differ either in coefficients or exponents and do not correspond to the correct degeneracies or energy values. Therefore, option A is the correct partition function expression that exactly matches the derived formula in coefficients and exponents, correctly accounting for all possible configurations and their energies.
