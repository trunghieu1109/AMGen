proposed answer: The problem requires ranking six benzene derivatives by the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed upon electrophilic bromination. The substituents influence regioselectivity based on their electronic effects and directing properties. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-C2H5) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions. Steric hindrance favors para substitution, especially for bulkier groups like ethyl, so ethylbenzene (5) should have the highest para-isomer yield, followed by toluene (1). Halogens like chlorine (-Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing, resulting in moderate para-isomer yield (3). Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (-NO2), carboxyl (-COOH), and ester (-COOC2H5) strongly deactivate the ring and are meta directors, leading to low para-isomer yields (4, 6, 2). Among these, nitro is the strongest EWG and should give the lowest para-isomer yield, followed by carboxyl and ester groups. Therefore, the expected order of increasing para-isomer fraction is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). Comparing this order with the given choices, choice B exactly matches this order. Other choices either misplace strong EWGs or the halogen and alkyl substituents. This conclusion is consistent with well-established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and directing effects, and it respects the problem constraint that only one monobromo derivative is formed, implying a predominant para-isomer in ortho/para directing groups and minimal para substitution in meta directing groups. Hence, choice B is the best answer.

proposed answer: The problem requires arranging six benzene derivatives by increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed upon electrophilic bromination, assuming only one monobromo derivative forms per substrate. The key to solving this is understanding the directing effects and activation/deactivation nature of each substituent on the benzene ring.

Step 1: Classify substituents by directing effects and activation/deactivation:
- Activating ortho/para directors: 1) -CH3 (methyl), 5) -C2H5 (ethyl)
- Deactivating ortho/para director: 3) -Cl (chlorine)
- Meta directors (deactivating): 2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate), 4) -NO2 (nitro), 6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)

Step 2: Interpret "only one monobromo derivative is formed":
- For ortho/para directors, steric hindrance favors para substitution, so the single isomer formed is the para isomer.
- For meta directors, substitution occurs at the meta position, so the para isomer is not formed.

Step 3: Determine para-isomer yield:
- Ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5) yield nearly 100% para-isomer.
- Meta directors (2, 4, 6) yield 0% para-isomer.

Step 4: Order within meta directors (all zero para-isomer):
- Based on strength of deactivation and meta-directing effect:
  - Strongest deactivator: 4) -NO2
  - Next: 6) -COOH
  - Least strong: 2) -COOC2H5

Step 5: Order within ortho/para directors:
- 3) -Cl is deactivating but ortho/para directing, so para yield is lower than fully activating groups.
- 1) -CH3 is activating.
- 5) -C2H5 is activating and bulkier, favoring para substitution more than methyl.

Step 6: Combine all:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

Step 7: Compare with given choices:
- Choice B) matches this order exactly.

No other choice matches this order exactly, so no re-evaluation is needed. This conclusion is robust, justified by fundamental organic chemistry principles, and respects the problem's constraints. It avoids forcing a fit to the options and ensures the final answer is chemically sound.
