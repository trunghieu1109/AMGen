proposed answer: The starting materials are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, which are geometric isomers differing in the configuration around the double bond. Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA leads to stereospecific epoxidation, preserving the stereochemistry of the double bond in the epoxide ring. Each alkene thus forms a distinct epoxide diastereomer. Because mCPBA is achiral, the epoxidation produces racemic mixtures for each diastereomer, meaning each diastereomer exists as two enantiomers. Therefore, the product mixture contains four stereoisomers: two diastereomers (from E and Z) each with a pair of enantiomers. On an achiral reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute (appear as one peak), but diastereomers separate due to different physical properties. Hence, the achiral HPLC shows two peaks corresponding to the two diastereomers. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each diastereomeric pair splits into two peaks, resulting in four peaks total. This reasoning assumes no stereochemical scrambling or epoxide ring opening during aqueous acid treatment and ideal chromatographic resolution. Alternative scenarios such as epoxide ring opening or stereochemical scrambling are not indicated by the problem statement, so the simplest stereochemical model applies. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in the standard achiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatograms.

proposed answer: The chemist starts with (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, which are geometric isomers differing in the spatial arrangement around the double bond. Upon treatment with mCPBA, epoxidation occurs stereospecifically, preserving the stereochemistry of the double bond. The (E)-oct-4-ene epoxidation yields a racemic mixture of diols (two enantiomers) after aqueous acid treatment, while the (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation yields a meso diol, which is achiral. Thus, the product mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso diol and a pair of enantiomers. On an achiral reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute because the stationary phase cannot differentiate between mirror images, so the two enantiomers appear as a single peak. The meso diol, being a diastereomer, separates from the racemic pair, resulting in two peaks total. On a chiral HPLC column, the stationary phase can resolve enantiomers, so the two enantiomers give two separate peaks, and the meso diol appears as a single peak. Therefore, three peaks are observed on the chiral column. This reasoning aligns with stereochemical principles and chromatographic behavior under ideal resolution conditions. Other scenarios, such as four peaks on achiral or fewer peaks, contradict the stereochemical nature of the products or chromatographic principles. Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks on the achiral HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC, corresponding to choice C).
