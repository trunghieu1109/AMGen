Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_169
proposed answer: The expectation value of the spin operator S_y is given by ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩. From the previous sub-task, the expectation value of σ_y was found to be -24/25. Multiplying this by ħ/2 gives ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25. This matches exactly with choice B. The other choices are either too large or have incorrect signs or factors. The spin state is assumed normalized or the calculation of ⟨σ_y⟩ already took normalization into account. The operator S_y is correctly defined as (ħ/2)σ_y, so the scalar multiplication is straightforward. Therefore, the best matching candidate is B) -12*hbar/25.
