proposed answer: In four-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4 to keep the action dimensionless. The fermion field \(\psi\) has mass dimension 3/2, and its Dirac adjoint \(\bar{\psi}\) also has dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension 2. The operator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so it does not contribute to the mass dimension. Therefore, the composite operator \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has total mass dimension \(3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5\). To maintain the overall Lagrangian density dimension of 4, the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must have mass dimension \(4 - 5 = -1\). A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a non-renormalizable interaction in four-dimensional quantum field theory because such couplings lead to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. This is a standard and well-established criterion in QFT. The other options suggesting \([\kappa]_M = 1\) are inconsistent with the dimensional analysis. Also, the options claiming renormalizability with negative mass dimension coupling are incorrect. Hence, the correct choice is the one stating \([\kappa]_M = -1\) and the theory is not renormalizable, which corresponds to option C).
