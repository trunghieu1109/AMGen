proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic power at wavelength λ. The radiation pattern's angular dependence is crucial to determine the fraction of maximum power A radiated at θ = 30°. For such oscillating charge distributions, the dominant radiation mode is typically dipolar or close to dipolar. Dipole radiation intensity varies as sin²θ, which peaks at θ = 90° and is zero at θ = 0°. Evaluating sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4, so the fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° is 1/4. This immediately excludes options with fractions 1/2 or 3/4 at 30°. Regarding wavelength dependence, classical dipole radiation power scales as the fourth power of frequency ω⁴, or equivalently as λ⁻⁴ since ω = 2πc/λ. Higher multipole radiation, such as quadrupole, scales with higher powers like λ⁻⁶, which is less likely dominant here given the problem context. Among the choices, only choice 3 has the correct fraction (1/4) and the correct wavelength dependence (λ⁻⁴). Choice 4, while having the correct angular fraction, proposes λ⁻³ dependence, which is not typical for radiation from oscillating charges. Choices 1 and 2 have incorrect angular fractions and/or unrealistic wavelength dependencies. Therefore, choice 3 best fits the physical model and expected radiation characteristics of an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution, making it the best candidate choice.

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic power at wavelength λ. The angular distribution of radiated power in the far field for a dipole oriented along the z-axis is proportional to sin²θ. The maximum power A occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²90° = 1. At θ = 30°, sin²30° = (1/2)² = 1/4, so the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4. Regarding wavelength dependence, classical dipole radiation power scales as the fourth power of frequency ω⁴, which translates to λ^{-4} dependence in terms of wavelength. The spheroidal shape affects the dipole moment magnitude but does not change the fundamental angular or wavelength dependence for the dipole mode. Higher multipole contributions would alter these dependencies, but the problem context and given options suggest the dipole approximation is appropriate. Evaluating the choices: Choice 1 (1/2, λ^{-4}) overestimates the angular fraction; Choice 2 (3/4, λ^{-6}) has incorrect angular fraction and unphysically steep wavelength dependence; Choice 3 (1/4, λ^{-4}) perfectly matches both angular fraction and wavelength dependence expected from dipole radiation; Choice 4 (1/4, λ^{-3}) has correct angular fraction but incorrect wavelength dependence. Therefore, Choice 3 is the only physically consistent and mathematically justified answer, consistent with classical electromagnetic theory and the symmetry considerations of the problem.
