Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_182
proposed answer: The starting compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has an initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 5. This is calculated as follows: 1 for the cyclohexane ring, 1 for the double bond in the ring (cyclohex-3-ene), 1 for the formyl group (aldehyde C=O), 1 for the vinyl substituent double bond, and 1 for the carboxylic acid C=O double bond. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, a strong reducing environment, the carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid) are reduced to methyl groups, removing their double bonds and thus reducing the IHD by 2. Additionally, the vinyl double bond and the ring double bond are saturated, removing 2 more degrees of unsaturation. The ring itself remains intact, contributing 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the final IHD is 5 (initial) - 4 (two carbonyls and two double bonds reduced) + 1 (ring) = 1. Alternative scenarios such as partial reduction or ring cleavage are unlikely under these conditions. This reasoning is consistent with known chemical behavior of red phosphorus and HI, which reduce oxygen functionalities and unsaturate double bonds without breaking the ring. Hence, the best matching IHD from the given choices is 1.
