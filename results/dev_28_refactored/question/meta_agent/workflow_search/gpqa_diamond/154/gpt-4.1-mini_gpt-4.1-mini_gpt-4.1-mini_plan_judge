Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). Given the state vector |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in the P_z eigenbasis, we first calculate the expectation value <P_z> and then <P_z^2>. The operator P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors. The expectation value <P_z> is thus <ψ|P_z|ψ> = ħ * |ψ_1|^2 + 0 * |ψ_2|^2 + (-ħ) * |ψ_3|^2 = ħ * (1/4) + 0 - ħ * (1/4) = 0. Next, <P_z^2> = <ψ|P_z^2|ψ> = ħ^2 * |ψ_1|^2 + 0 + ħ^2 * |ψ_3|^2 = ħ^2 * (1/4 + 1/4) = ħ^2 / 2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(ħ^2/2 - 0^2) = ħ / sqrt(2). Comparing to the provided choices, this matches choice C). This result makes physical sense as the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, so P_z is uncertain. The detailed calculations from multiple independent agents confirm this result, and no other choice matches the computed uncertainty better. Hence, the best choice is C).
