Iteration: Test New Architecture_172
proposed answer: The problem asks to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling at speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^(-10) m. According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s. From this, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is Δp ≈ ħ/(2 Δx) = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) / (2 × 1 × 10^(-10)) = 5.27 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The electron's kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m), and the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated by ΔE ≈ v Δp, since dE/dp = p/m = v for non-relativistic speeds. Multiplying, ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8 m/s) × (5.27 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s) = 1.05 × 10^(-16) J. Although the electron speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (~2/3 c), the problem does not specify relativistic corrections, so the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable for an estimate. Comparing this calculated ΔE to the given options (~10^(-19) J, ~10^(-18) J, ~10^(-16) J, ~10^(-17) J), the closest match is choice C) ~10^(-16) J. Other options differ by orders of magnitude and are inconsistent with the calculation. Therefore, the best matching candidate for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is choice C).
