Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a polygonal aperture with apothem length a, illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength λ. As the number of sides N approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circular aperture of radius a. The far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern, whose intensity minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The angular positions of these minima θ_n are given by θ_n = x_n * (λ / (2πa)), where x_n are the zeros of J1. The first two zeros of J1 are approximately x_1 = 3.8317 and x_2 = 7.0156. Using the small-angle approximation (sin θ ≈ θ), the angular positions of the first two minima are θ_1 ≈ 3.8317 * (λ / (2πa)) ≈ 0.61 * (λ / a) and θ_2 ≈ 7.0156 * (λ / (2πa)) ≈ 1.115 * (λ / a). The angular distance between the first two minima is therefore Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 ≈ (1.115 - 0.61) * (λ / a) = 0.505 * (λ / a). This value closely matches choice D (0.506 λ / a). Other choices correspond to either the position of the first minimum alone or incorrect factors. Hence, the angular distance between the first two minima for the circular aperture diffraction pattern is approximately 0.506 λ / a. This conclusion is consistent with the physical interpretation and mathematical derivation of the Airy pattern minima positions.
