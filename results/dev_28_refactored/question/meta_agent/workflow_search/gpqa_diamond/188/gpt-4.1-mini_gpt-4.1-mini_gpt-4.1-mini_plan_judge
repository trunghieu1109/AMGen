Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_188
proposed answer: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state of a system does not exhibit the symmetry of the underlying physical laws, leading to the emergence of low-energy excitations called Goldstone bosons. Among the given particles: Magnons arise as spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry, so they are associated with SSB. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, thus linked to SSB. Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations that emerge because the crystal lattice spontaneously breaks continuous translational symmetry, so phonons are also associated with SSB. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topological charge and stability due to topology rather than symmetry breaking. They do not correspond to Goldstone bosons and do not arise directly from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Therefore, the particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion, corresponding to choice B).
