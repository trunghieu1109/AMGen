Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with 100% intensity indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol. The presence of a secondary peak at m/z = 158 with 32% intensity strongly suggests the presence of one chlorine atom due to the characteristic isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl) with a roughly 3:1 ratio. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, typical of O-H stretching vibrations found in carboxylic acids, and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 which corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), indicating a para-substituted benzene ring with symmetrical splitting patterns. Evaluating the candidate structures: 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all criteria perfectly â€” molecular weight (156 g/mol), chlorine isotopic pattern, carboxylic acid functional group, and para-substituted aromatic proton pattern. 2-chlorobenzoic acid would show a different aromatic proton splitting pattern due to ortho substitution, not two doublets of equal integration. 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has a different molecular weight and functional groups (aldehyde and phenol instead of carboxylic acid), which would shift the IR and NMR peaks differently and not show the acidic proton at 11 ppm. Phenyl chloroformate lacks the acidic proton and has a different molecular weight and IR pattern. Therefore, the most consistent structural suggestion based on the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
