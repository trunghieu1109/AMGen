proposed answer: The initial state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)^T is first normalized to |ψ_norm⟩ = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)^T, since the norm is √(1 + 4 + 1) = √6. The operator P has eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is |v_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. After measuring P and obtaining eigenvalue 0, the state collapses to the projection of |ψ_norm⟩ onto |v_0⟩. The projection coefficient c = ⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = -2/(√2√6) = -1/√3. The unnormalized projected state is |ψ_proj⟩ = c|v_0⟩ = (-1/√6, 0, 1/√6)^T. Normalizing |ψ_proj⟩ gives |ψ_post⟩ = (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T. Next, operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1, with eigenvector for eigenvalue -1 as |q_-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)^T. The probability of measuring Q = -1 from |ψ_post⟩ is the squared magnitude of the projection onto |q_-1⟩: |⟨q_-1|ψ_post⟩|^2 = |1/√2|^2 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of sequentially measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is 1/2. This calculation is consistent with quantum measurement postulates and the given operators and state.

proposed answer: To find the joint probability of sequential measurements P=0 followed by Q=-1, we first normalize the initial state vector \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). Its norm is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is \( \psi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Next, we find the eigenspace of operator P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Solving \( P\mathbf{v} = 0 \) yields the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \), which normalized is \( \mathbf{u}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Projecting \( \psi_0 \) onto this eigenspace gives the amplitude:
\[
\alpha = \langle \mathbf{u}_0 | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1,0,-1) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} (-1,2,1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 - 1) = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability of measuring \( P=0 \) is \( |\alpha|^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

The post-measurement state after measuring \( P=0 \) is the normalized projection:
\[
\psi_{post} = \pm \mathbf{u}_0 = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalue \( -1 \) corresponding to eigenvector \( \mathbf{w}_{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

The conditional probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) given the post-measurement state is:
\[
\beta = \langle \mathbf{w}_{-1} | \psi_{post} \rangle = (0,0,1) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1,0,-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The conditional probability is \( |\beta|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the joint probability of sequentially measuring \( P=0 \) then \( Q=-1 \) is:
\[
P = P(P=0) \times P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

This calculation explicitly multiplies the probability of the first measurement outcome with the conditional probability of the second, consistent with quantum measurement postulates. It avoids the mistake of reporting only the conditional probability and ensures the final answer is correct and consistent with the problem's requirements.
