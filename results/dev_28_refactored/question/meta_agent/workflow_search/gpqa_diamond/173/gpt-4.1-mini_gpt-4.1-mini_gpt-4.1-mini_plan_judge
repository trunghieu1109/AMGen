proposed answer: The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV and splits into two fragments with rest masses in the ratio 2:1. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass, meaning 1% of the mass (3 GeV) is converted into kinetic energy. Let the lighter fragment have rest mass m, then the heavier fragment has rest mass 2m, with 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M. The total kinetic energy T_total = 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments. Conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta p. Using relativistic energy-momentum relations, the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment T1 can be calculated precisely. The classical approximation for kinetic energy is T1_classical = p^2/(2*2m). Calculating both T1 and T1_classical and finding their difference yields a value on the order of 10 MeV. This difference is small compared to the total kinetic energy (3 GeV) but significant enough to be measurable and relevant. Among the given options (2, 5, 10, 20 MeV), 10 MeV best matches the computed difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the heavier fragment. Therefore, option A) is the correct choice. This conclusion is consistent with relativistic kinematics and energy conservation principles, and the scale of the difference aligns well with the problem’s parameters.

proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest-mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with a mass ratio of 2:1, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the original mass, indicating a 1% mass loss converted into kinetic energy. The heavier fragment has rest mass m1 = 2m and the lighter fragment m2 = m, with m1 + m2 = 0.99M. The total kinetic energy released is 0.01M c^2 = 3 GeV. Using conservation of momentum and relativistic energy relations, the momentum p of each fragment is found to be about 20 GeV/c. The relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is T1_rel = sqrt(p^2 + m1^2) - m1 ≈ 1.01 GeV = 1010 MeV. The classical kinetic energy approximation is T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1) ≈ 1.0 GeV = 1000 MeV. The difference ΔT = T1_rel - T1_classical ≈ 10 MeV. This difference is small but significant, consistent with relativistic corrections expected at velocities around 0.1c. The numerical results and physical reasoning confirm that the relativistic correction to the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is about 10 MeV, matching choice A). Other options (5 MeV, 2 MeV, 20 MeV) are either too small or too large compared to the calculated difference. Therefore, the best matching answer is A).
