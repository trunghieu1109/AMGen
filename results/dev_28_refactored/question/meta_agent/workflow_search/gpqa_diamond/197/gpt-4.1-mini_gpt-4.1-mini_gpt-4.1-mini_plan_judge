Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_197
proposed answer: The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt species in solution. Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex was calculated as 0.00169 M. The percentage is then (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%. This matches choice A). The calculation assumes the SCN- concentration remains effectively constant due to its large excess, and the cumulative constants are used correctly to find the species distribution. Other choices (42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%) do not match the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer is A).
