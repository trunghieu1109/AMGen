proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), defined on the disk where x^2 + y^2 < 4. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we convert to polar coordinates (r, θ), where r^2 = x^2 + y^2. The metric becomes ds^2 = (32 / (4 - r^2)) (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2). The area element dA is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dr dθ, which simplifies to dA = (32 / (4 - r^2)) r dr dθ. The total area A is then the integral over θ from 0 to 2π and r from 0 to 2: A = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dθ = 2π ∫_0^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr. Substituting u = 4 - r^2, then du = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2. Changing the limits accordingly, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. The integral becomes 16 ∫_4^{0} (1/u) (-du) = 16 ∫_0^{4} (1/u) du = 16 [ln|u|]_0^{4} = 16 (ln 4 - ln 0). Since ln 0 → -∞, the integral diverges to +∞. This means the area is infinite. The other options involving expressions dependent on x and y do not make sense for a scalar area quantity, and zero area is inconsistent with the metric. Therefore, the only consistent answer is that the area is infinite.
