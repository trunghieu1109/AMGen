proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation models the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device under specific assumptions. These assumptions include: (1) The device is trap-free, meaning no traps capture carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship. Traps would change the voltage dependence and magnitude of the current, invalidating the simple Mott-Gurney form. (2) The device is single-carrier, meaning only one type of charge carrier (electron or hole) dominates conduction. The presence of two types of carriers complicates the space charge and current behavior beyond the scope of the equation. (3) The contacts are Ohmic, implying no carrier injection barrier, ensuring efficient carrier injection. Injection barriers, such as those in Schottky contacts, limit injection and thus current, violating the assumption of space-charge-limited current. (4) The transport is dominated by drift current, with negligible diffusion current, since the Mott-Gurney equation assumes drift-dominated transport in the SCLC regime. Evaluating each choice: Choice 1 states a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This matches all the assumptions perfectly, making it valid. Choice 2 mentions negligible drift current, which contradicts the drift-dominated transport assumption; hence, it is invalid. Choice 3 involves a two-carrier device, violating the single-carrier assumption, so it is invalid. Choice 4 assumes a Schottky contact, which introduces a carrier injection barrier, violating the barrier-free injection assumption; thus, it is invalid. Therefore, only Choice 1 satisfies all necessary theoretical and physical criteria for the Mott-Gurney equation's applicability.
