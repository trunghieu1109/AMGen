proposed answer: The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R with a small spherical cavity inside it, displaced by a vector s from the conductor's center. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The point P is outside the conductor at distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R. The distance from P to the cavity center is l, and the angle between vectors l and s is θ. Since the conductor is a perfect conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material (outside the cavity) must be zero. This condition forces induced charges on the cavity's inner surface and the conductor's outer surface. Because the conductor is isolated and uncharged, the total induced charge on the conductor's outer surface sums to zero, so the net charge outside the conductor is +q. The displacement s breaks spherical symmetry inside the conductor, but the conductor rearranges induced charges to cancel all higher multipole moments caused by the off-center charge +q, leaving only the monopole moment +q located effectively at the conductor's center. By the uniqueness theorem and electrostatic shielding, the field outside the conductor is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor center. Therefore, the electric field magnitude at point P outside the conductor is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q at the origin (the conductor center): E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². The parameters l, s, and θ describe internal geometry but do not affect the external field due to the conductor's shielding. This is consistent with limiting cases: when s=0 (cavity centered), the field outside is that of a point charge +q at the center; for large distances L >> R, the field behaves as a monopole field decreasing as 1/L². Hence, the correct expression for the electric field magnitude at point P outside the conductor is choice D). The other choices involve l, s, and θ in ways that do not correspond to the physical reality of the shielding effect and the conductor's influence on the field outside. Thus, the best matching candidate is D).
