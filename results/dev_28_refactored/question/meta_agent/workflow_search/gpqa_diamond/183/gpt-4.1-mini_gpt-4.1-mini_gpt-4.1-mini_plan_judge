proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires the introduction of three substituents on the benzene ring in specific positions: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and a nitro group at position 3 (meta to ethoxy). Achieving this substitution pattern with high yield and regioselectivity requires careful planning of the reaction sequence, considering the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of intermediates.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 should be performed first to introduce the tert-butyl group. This group is an electron-donating group (EDG) and ortho/para director, which will influence the position of subsequent electrophilic substitutions.
2. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) follows to introduce the nitro group. The tert-butyl group directs nitration to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. Since the tert-butyl is at position 2, nitration will occur at position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy group to be introduced later.
3. Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (Fe/HCl) is necessary to allow further functional group transformations.
4. Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
5. Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol intermediate.
6. Alkylation of the phenol with ethyl bromide in the presence of NaOH (NaOH/EtBr) introduces the ethoxy group at position 1.
7. Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and subsequent desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) can be used as a blocking strategy to control regioselectivity and prevent substitution at undesired positions during the sequence.

Comparing the options:
- Choice A follows this logical sequence, respecting directing effects and functional group transformations, ensuring high yield and correct regioselectivity.
- Choice B introduces sulfonation too early and repeats nitration at the end, which is inconsistent and may lead to poor regioselectivity.
- Choice C misorders nitration and sulfonation steps, risking low yield and incorrect substitution.
- Choice D starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring and hinders Friedel-Crafts alkylation afterward, making the sequence impractical.

Therefore, choice A is the optimal sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, as it carefully sequences the reactions to exploit directing effects, functional group transformations, and blocking strategies to achieve the desired substitution pattern with high yield and regioselectivity.

proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Achieving this substitution pattern with high yield and regioselectivity demands careful planning of the synthetic sequence, considering the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of intermediates.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3) is performed first on benzene to introduce the bulky tert-butyl group. This group is a strong ortho/para director and activates the ring toward electrophilic substitution, setting the stage for regioselective nitration.

Step 2: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) follows, introducing the nitro group meta to the tert-butyl substituent, which corresponds to position 3 relative to the tert-butyl at position 2. This step is efficient because the ring is activated by the tert-butyl group.

Step 3: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (Fe/HCl) is necessary to enable further functional group transformations. The amino group is a strong ortho/para director and can be converted into a diazonium salt.

Step 4: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts the amino group into a diazonium salt.

Step 5: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, yielding a phenol at position 1.

Step 6: Alkylation of the phenol with ethyl bromide in the presence of NaOH introduces the ethoxy group at position 1, completing the target molecule.

The sulfonation and desulfonation steps present in some options are unnecessary and would complicate the synthesis without benefit. Also, repeated nitration steps are redundant and may cause over-substitution or ring deactivation.

Other options that start with nitration or sulfonation before alkylation are less favorable because nitration deactivates the ring, hindering Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and sulfonation deactivates the ring, reducing nitration efficiency.

Therefore, Choice A, ignoring the redundant second nitration and sulfonation steps, provides the most plausible, efficient, and high-yield synthetic route. It respects the directing effects, functional group compatibility, and practical synthetic methods, ensuring regioselectivity and maximizing yield.
