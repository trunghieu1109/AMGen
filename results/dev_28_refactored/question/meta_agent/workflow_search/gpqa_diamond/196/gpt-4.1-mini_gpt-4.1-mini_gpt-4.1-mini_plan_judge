proposed answer: The IR spectrum of compound X shows a broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, characteristic of the O–H stretch of a carboxylic acid, and a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), typical of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, and two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) correspond to a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. Thus, compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a classical reduction method that converts carboxylic acids into the corresponding alkyl derivatives by replacing the -COOH group with a hydrogen atom, effectively reducing the acid to a methyl group. Therefore, the product after reaction will be a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group, i.e., 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Among the given choices, only choice A matches this product. Choice B retains the acid group, inconsistent with the reduction. Choice C has a different substitution pattern and retains acid functionality. Choice D has a different alkyl substituent (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl), inconsistent with the NMR data. Hence, the most plausible final product, consistent with the spectral data and reaction conditions, is choice A, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
