Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_151
proposed answer: Shmoo formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a mating response triggered by pheromone signaling, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and activation of mating-specific gene expression. The experimental approach involves chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) to identify proteins associated with active chromatin in the shmoo. Active chromatin is characterized by transcriptionally active regions, which are enriched with proteins involved in transcription initiation, transcription regulation, and chromatin structure. The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is essential for transcription initiation at gene promoters and would be present in active chromatin. Enhancer protein complexes regulate transcription and are expected to be associated with active chromatin regions. The nucleosome histone complex forms the fundamental structural unit of chromatin and is ubiquitously present, including in active chromatin, albeit with dynamic remodeling. In contrast, the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) functions to license origins of replication during late M and G1 phases to prepare for DNA synthesis in S phase. Since shmoo formation involves G1 arrest and active transcription rather than DNA replication, the pre-RC is not actively assembled or enriched on chromatin during this state. Therefore, in a ChIP-MS assay targeting active chromatin in shmoo cells, proteins from the pre-replication complex would be least observed compared to the other complexes. This conclusion is consistent with the known biology of yeast mating response, cell cycle regulation, and chromatin dynamics, and aligns with the experimental context of analyzing active chromatin proteome during shmoo formation.
