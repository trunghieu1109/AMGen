proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR^2σT^4. Given that both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission, by Wien's displacement law, their surface temperatures are equal (T1 = T2). The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R1 = 1.5 * R2). Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * 1 = 2.25. The mass ratio does not affect the luminosity calculation in this context. The radial velocities (0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2) could cause Doppler shifts in observed wavelengths, but since the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same, this implies that any Doppler effects are either corrected for or measurements are made in the stars' rest frames. Hence, radial velocity differences do not impact the intrinsic luminosity ratio. Among the given options (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the exact theoretical calculation yields 2.25, making option A) the correct and most consistent choice. This conclusion is robust because it is based on fundamental physical laws and the given data, with no evidence suggesting additional corrections are needed.

proposed answer: The intrinsic luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, assuming equal temperatures from the same peak wavelength, is given by the ratio of their surface areas, which is (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which introduces relativistic Doppler effects. The Doppler factor δ is calculated as δ = sqrt((1 - β)/(1 + β)) with β = v/c = 700/300000 ≈ 0.0023333, giving δ ≈ 0.99767. Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal, Star_2's intrinsic temperature must be higher by about 0.23% (T2 = T1/δ). Because luminosity depends on temperature to the fourth power, this temperature difference reduces the intrinsic luminosity ratio to approximately 2.23 (2.25 * (1/1.0023)^4 ≈ 2.23). Next, the observed luminosity of Star_2 is affected by relativistic beaming and time dilation, scaling as L_obs = L_emit * δ^4. Since δ < 1 for a receding star, the observed luminosity is reduced by δ^4 ≈ 0.9907. Correcting for this, the observed luminosity ratio becomes 2.23 / 0.9907 ≈ 2.25, effectively restoring the initial intrinsic ratio. This shows that the relativistic Doppler and beaming effects nearly cancel the temperature correction, leaving the final observed luminosity ratio close to 2.25. Comparing this to the provided choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the value ~2.25 is the closest and most consistent with the detailed relativistic corrections. Other options differ by a margin larger than the small relativistic corrections justify. Therefore, the best answer is choice A) ~2.25.
