proposed answer: The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 arises from one-loop radiative corrections involving particles coupled to the scalar sector of the extended Standard Model. The key points to consider are:

1. Radiative corrections depend on the quartic powers of the masses (M^4) of particles running in the loops, reflecting dominant contributions in the effective potential.

2. Bosonic particles contribute positively to M_{h_2}^2 due to their statistics and loop effects. These include the SM-like Higgs boson h_1, the gauge bosons W and Z, the charged Higgs H^{\pm}, the neutral scalar H^0, and the pseudoscalar A^0.

3. Fermionic particles contribute negatively due to Fermi-Dirac statistics. The dominant fermionic contributions come from the top quark t and the singlet fermions N_i.

4. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) x = \langle \phi \rangle and v = \langle h \rangle combine as (x^2 + v^2), which sets the scale of symmetry breaking and appears in the denominator to ensure correct mass dimension and normalization of the mass squared formula.

5. The overall factor 1/(8\pi^2 (x^2 + v^2)) is characteristic of one-loop corrections normalized by the symmetry breaking scale squared.

6. The coefficients \alpha_i encode coupling constants, multiplicities, and group theory factors from the loop calculations.

Evaluating the four candidate formulas:

- Choice A) lacks the top quark term, which is significant due to its large Yukawa coupling, and includes A^0 positively but misses the negative fermionic top quark contribution.

- Choice B) includes the top quark with a negative sign but omits the pseudoscalar A^0 contribution.

- Choice C) includes all relevant bosonic contributions (h_1, W, Z, H^{\pm}, H^0, A^0) positively, and fermionic contributions (top quark and singlet fermions) negatively, with the correct denominator factor.

- Choice D) incorrectly places (x^2 + v^2) in the numerator, which leads to incorrect mass dimension and is thus physically inconsistent.

Therefore, choice C) is the most theoretically consistent and complete expression for the approximate mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections in this model. It correctly captures the positive bosonic and negative fermionic contributions, includes all relevant particles, and has the proper normalization factor in the denominator, ensuring correct dimensionality and physical interpretation.
