Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars per unit parallax interval varies as N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = k/r for some constant k, substituting gives N(plx) ∝ 1/(k/r)^5 = (r/k)^5 ∝ r^5. This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval increases as the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit distance interval, N(r), not per unit parallax interval. To convert the distribution from parallax to distance, we use the change of variables formula for densities: N(r) dr = N(plx) d(plx), or equivalently, N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|. Differentiating plx = k/r gives d(plx)/dr = -k/r^2, so |d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r^2. Therefore, N(r) ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This means the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as the cube of the distance. This result aligns with physical intuition about a three-dimensional spatial distribution of stars, where volume (and thus the number of stars within a shell of thickness dr) scales as r^3. Alternative interpretations, such as considering the given relation as cumulative counts or different definitions of the star count function, could yield different exponents (e.g., r^4 or r^5), but these are less consistent with the problem statement and standard astrophysical conventions. The straightforward and mathematically consistent interpretation is that the number of stars per unit distance interval varies as r^3. All expert analyses and multiple agents agree on this conclusion, confirming that the best choice is C).
