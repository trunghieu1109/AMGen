proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1 and satisfy the relation (σ · n)^2 = I, where I is the identity operator. This implies that the eigenvalues of the operator σ · n are ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is Hermitian and involutory, so its eigenvalues are exactly ±1. Multiplying by the scalar ε, which has dimensions of energy, scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The factor ħ/2 appears when the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ is used, representing the physical spin angular momentum. However, the Hamiltonian here is explicitly given as H = ε σ · n without the ħ/2 factor. Therefore, the eigenvalues do not include ħ/2. The eigenvalues ±1 alone (choice C) are dimensionless and do not have the correct energy dimension. Choices involving ħ/2 (choices B and D) correspond to the spin operator S or Hamiltonians expressed in terms of S, which is not the case here. Hence, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are ±ε, matching choice A). This conclusion is consistent with the algebraic properties of Pauli matrices, the definition of the Hamiltonian, and standard quantum mechanics conventions.
