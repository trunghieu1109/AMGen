Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_22
proposed answer: We verify the list [5, 7, 9, 9] against all problem criteria: 1) Sum: 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, which matches the required sum. 2) Unique mode: 9 appears twice, while 5 and 7 appear once each, so 9 is the unique mode. 3) Median: The list sorted is [5, 7, 9, 9]. The median is the average of the two middle numbers (7 and 9), which is (7 + 9)/2 = 8. 8 is a positive integer and does not appear in the list, satisfying the median condition. 4) All elements are positive integers. No other list with these properties and sum 30 can have a different sum of squares because other candidate lists either do not sum to 30 or do not have the median not in the list. Therefore, the sum of squares for the valid list is 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This solution is unique and valid as it meets all the problem's constraints exactly.
