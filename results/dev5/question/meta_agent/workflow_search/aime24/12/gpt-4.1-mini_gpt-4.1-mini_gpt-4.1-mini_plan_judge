proposed answer: We start with the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where |z| = 4. Let z = 4e^{iθ}. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Substitute these into the expression:

(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this expression is:
Re[4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}] = Re[(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)].

Expanding:
= Re[(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)]
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + Re[i(...)]
= (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ).

We want to maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This can be written as R cos(θ + α) where R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.

And α satisfies cosα = 324/540 = 3/5, sinα = 432/540 = 4/5.

Since the term is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ + α) with α = -arctan(4/3) (because of the negative sign in front of sinθ).

The maximum value of cos(θ + α) is 1, achieved at θ = -α = -(-arctan(4/3)) = arctan(4/3).

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540, achieved at θ = arctan(4/3).

Since |z|=4, and z = 4e^{iθ}, this satisfies the constraint.

The maximum is unique modulo 2π because cosine achieves its maximum uniquely at that angle.

Hence, the maximum real part is 540, achieved at θ = arctan(4/3) (mod 2π), with |z|=4.

This confirms the correctness and uniqueness of the solution.

Answer:The value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = arctan(4/3) (mod 2π). At this θ, the maximum real part of the expression is 540. This satisfies the constraint |z|=4 since z = 4e^{iθ}. The maximum is unique modulo 2π.
Extracted answer: The value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = arctan(4/3) (mod 2π). At this θ, the maximum real part of the expression is 540. This satisfies the constraint |z|=4 since z = 4e^{iθ}. The maximum is unique modulo 2π.
Correct answer: 540
