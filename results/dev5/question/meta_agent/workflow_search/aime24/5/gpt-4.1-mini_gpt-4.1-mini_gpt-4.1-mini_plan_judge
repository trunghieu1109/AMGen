Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The inradius of the tetrahedron is given in the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, where m=27, n=2, and p=20. These values satisfy the problem's conditions: m and p are coprime (27 and 20 share no common factors), and n=2 is square-free. To find the final answer, we sum these integers: m + n + p = 27 + 2 + 20 = 49.

proposed answer: The problem gives a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths and states there exists a point I inside it equidistant from all faces, meaning I is the incenter and the distance is the inradius. The inradius can be expressed as (m * sqrt(n)) / p with m, n, p positive integers, m and p coprime, and n square-free. From the detailed analysis and previous sub-tasks, the inradius was found to be (27âˆš2)/20. Checking the conditions: m=27, n=2, p=20. 27 and 20 share no common prime factors, so they are coprime. 2 is prime and thus square-free. The expression is in simplest form. Summing these gives 27 + 2 + 20 = 49. This value is consistent with the tetrahedron's dimensions and the geometric properties of the incenter. Therefore, the final answer is 49.
