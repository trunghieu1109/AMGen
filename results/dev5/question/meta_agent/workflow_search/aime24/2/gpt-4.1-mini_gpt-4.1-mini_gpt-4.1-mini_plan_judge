Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The total number of possible colorings of the octagon's 8 vertices, each independently colored red or blue with equal probability, is 2^8 = 256. From the previous analysis, the number of valid colorings for which there exists a rotation mapping all blue vertices to originally red vertices is 193. The probability is therefore 193/256. Since 193 is a prime number and does not divide 256, the fraction 193/256 is already in lowest terms. Hence, m = 193 and n = 256. The problem asks for m + n, which is 193 + 256 = 449.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the total number of valid colorings (colorings for which there exists a rotation mapping all blue vertices to originally red vertices) is 113. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. The probability is therefore 113/256. Since 113 is a prime number and does not divide 256, the fraction 113/256 is already in lowest terms. Thus, m = 113 and n = 256. The problem asks for m + n, which is 113 + 256 = 369. This matches the detailed combinatorial reasoning involving group actions, independent sets in cycles, and inclusion-exclusion principle. All problem conditions have been met and the fraction is simplified correctly.
