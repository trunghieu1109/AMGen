Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: From the previous calculations, we found s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. Let's verify these values with the original problem constraints. 

1. For speed s = 2.5 km/h:
   Walking time = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3 hours 36 minutes.
   Coffee time t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours.
   Total time = 3.6 + 0.4 = 4 hours, which matches the given total time.

2. For speed s + 2 = 4.5 km/h:
   Walking time = 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours.
   Coffee time t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours.
   Total time = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours = 2 hours 24 minutes, which matches the given total time.

Thus, s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes satisfy the problem conditions.

Now, for speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h:
   Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.
   Coffee time t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours.
   Total time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

This total time is consistent with the problem's physical meaning and formatting requirements. Therefore, the total time including coffee time when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h is 204 minutes.
