Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) is calculated as P(4 matches) / P(at least 2 matches). From previous calculations, P(4 matches) = 1/210 and P(at least 2 matches) = 23/42. Thus, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210 * 23) = 42 / 4830. Simplifying 42/4830 by dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives 7/805. Since 7 and 805 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 7 and n = 805, and m + n = 812. This confirms the previous result is correct and the simplification is accurate.

proposed answer: From the previous subtasks, the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize was found to be 1/115. The numerator and denominator were checked for their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1, confirming that the fraction is already in simplest form. Multiplying back by the GCD confirms the fraction is consistent and fully reduced. Therefore, the simplified fraction is m/n = 1/115. The problem asks for m + n, which is 1 + 115 = 116. All calculations have been verified step-by-step, including the combinatorial counts, probability computations, fraction simplification, and GCD determination, ensuring no arithmetic errors remain. The solution is complete and correct.
