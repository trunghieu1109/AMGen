Then simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by the GCD. Document the GCD calculation step-by-step and confirm that the resulting fraction is in lowest terms. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KMoQ:\nFrom subtask 5a, the unsimplified conditional probability fraction is (1/210) / (115/210). Simplifying this, we get (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115. So the fraction before simplification is 1/115. The numerator is 1 and the denominator is 115. To find the GCD of 1 and 115, we note that 1 divides every integer, so GCD(1, 115) = 1. Dividing numerator and denominator by 1 leaves the fraction unchanged as 1/115. Since the numerator is 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1/115.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent KMoQ:\nGCD(1, 115) = 1; simplified fraction = 1/115\n\n### Sub-task 5c: Validate the fraction simplification by multiplying the simplified numerator and denominator by the GCD to verify that the original unsimplified fraction is recovered.

To validate the simplification, multiply the simplified numerator and denominator by the GCD: 1 * 1 = 1 and 115 * 1 = 115. This yields the original fraction 1/115, confirming that the simplification is correct and consistent. Since the GCD is 1, the fraction cannot be reduced further, so it is fully reduced. This confirms that the simplified fraction 1/115 is accurate and consistent with the original unsimplified fraction.\n\n### answer by Reflexion Agent 2SOe:\nMultiplying the simplified fraction 1/115 by the GCD 1 gives (1*1)/(115*1) = 1/115, which matches the original fraction.
