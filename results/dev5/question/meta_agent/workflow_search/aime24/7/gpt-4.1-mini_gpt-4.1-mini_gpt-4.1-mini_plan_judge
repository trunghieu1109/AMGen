proposed answer: We have the equations: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. From the first, y^x = x^{10}. From the second, x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, we get x ln y = 10 ln x and 4y ln x = 10 ln y. From the first, ln y = (10 ln x)/x. Substitute into the second: 4y ln x = 10 * (10 ln x)/x, so 4y ln x = 100 ln x / x. Since ln x > 0 (x > 1), divide both sides by ln x: 4y = 100 / x, so y = 25 / x. Then xy = x * (25 / x) = 25. To verify, substitute y = 25 / x back into the first equation: y^x = (25 / x)^x = x^{10}. Taking ln both sides: x ln(25 / x) = 10 ln x, which simplifies to x (ln 25 - ln x) = 10 ln x, or x ln 25 - x ln x = 10 ln x, rearranged to x ln 25 = (x + 10) ln x. This transcendental equation has a solution for x > 1, and corresponding y = 25 / x > 1. Similarly, the second equation holds true with these values. Thus, the product xy = 25 satisfies both equations and domain constraints. Therefore, the final validated answer is 25.
