Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_15
proposed answer: The problem involves four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). All 900 residents own candy hearts, so C is the universal set. The counts for exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts plus exactly one or two of the other three items respectively. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items (D, G, S, and C). Using the given data: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, exactly two items = 437, exactly three items = 234, and total residents = 900. The sum of owners of D, G, S is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. The formula relating these is: |D| + |G| + |S| = (number owning exactly one of D,G,S) + 2*(number owning exactly two of D,G,S) + 3*(number owning exactly three of D,G,S). Given exactly two items = 437 (candy hearts + exactly one of D,G,S), exactly three items = 234 (candy hearts + exactly two of D,G,S), and x = number owning all three D,G,S (and thus all four items including candy hearts). So, 1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3*x => 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3x => 1124 = 905 + 3x => 3x = 219 => x = 73. Verification: The counts for exactly one, two, and three items sum to 437 + 234 + 73 = 744. The remaining 156 residents own only candy hearts. This distribution is consistent with the problem constraints. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
