Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The supremum of BD^2 was found by analyzing the constraint tanh u * tanh v = -5/6 and the expression BD^2 = 176 / (1 - tanh^2 v) - 96. Since |tanh v| must be greater than 5/6 to satisfy the constraint and less than 1 (because tanh is bounded by ±1), BD^2 increases without bound as |tanh v| approaches 1. This means BD^2 can be made arbitrarily large, so no finite maximum exists. The minimal BD^2 occurs at the boundary |tanh v| = 5/6, yielding approximately 480, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, which corresponds to the supremum of BD^2. Since BD^2 is unbounded above, the supremum is infinite. This is consistent with all constraints and no contradictions or overlooked cases remain. The diagonals intersect at the origin, the rhombus condition is satisfied by the perpendicularity constraint, and the points lie on the hyperbola by construction. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi does not exist finitely; BD^2 can be arbitrarily large.

Answer:There is no finite greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi; the supremum of BD^2 is infinite.
Extracted answer: There is no finite greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi; the supremum of BD^2 is infinite.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all rhombi inscribed on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. This is equivalent to finding the greatest lower bound (infimum) of BD^2 over all such rhombi. From the analysis, BD^2 can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions and parameters describing points on the hyperbola. The rhombus conditions impose constraints but do not bound BD^2 from above, so BD^2 can grow arbitrarily large. However, BD^2 has a minimum value attained when the parameter t2 = 0, giving BD^2 = 80. Since BD^2 ≥ 80 for all such rhombi, and can be arbitrarily large, the greatest real number less than all BD^2 values is exactly 80. This aligns with the problem's wording and intent, as no finite maximum exists but a minimum positive lower bound does. The reasoning is consistent, no contradictions or overlooked cases appear, and the conclusion is that the infimum of BD^2 is 80. Hence, the final answer is 80.
