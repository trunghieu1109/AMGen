Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We have the system of equations in terms of a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z):
1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) b - a - c = 1/3
3) c - a - b = 1/4
Adding all three gives: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Simplifying the left side: a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = - (a + b + c)
Right side sum: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12
So, - (a + b + c) = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12
Using equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2
Substitute b + c = (a + b + c) - a = -13/12 - a
So, a - (-13/12 - a) = 1/2 => 2a + 13/12 = 1/2 => 2a = 1/2 - 13/12 = -7/12 => a = -7/24
Using equation (2): b - a - c = 1/3
Substitute a + c = (a + b + c) - b = -13/12 - b
So, b - (-13/12 - b) = 1/3 => 2b + 13/12 = 1/3 => 2b = 1/3 - 13/12 = -9/12 => b = -3/8
Using equation (3): c - a - b = 1/4
Substitute a + b = (a + b + c) - c = -13/12 - c
So, c - (-13/12 - c) = 1/4 => 2c + 13/12 = 1/4 => 2c = 1/4 - 13/12 = -10/12 => c = -5/12
Now compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
4a = 4*(-7/24) = -7/6
3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2*(-5/12) = -5/6
Sum = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6
Convert to common denominator 24:
-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24
Sum = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8
Absolute value is 25/8, which is in simplest form since 25 and 8 are coprime.
Therefore, m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.
This confirms the correctness of the simplification and final sum. Hence, the final answer is 33.
