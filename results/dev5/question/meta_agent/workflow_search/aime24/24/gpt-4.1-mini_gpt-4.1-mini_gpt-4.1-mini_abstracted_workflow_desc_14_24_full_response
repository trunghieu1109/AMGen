Since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest form. Therefore, the sum \\( m + n = 25 + 8 = 33 \\). This matches the final answer given in the original sub-task 1 solution and confirms the correctness of the simplification and final sum. Hence, the final answer to the original problem is 33.; answer: 33\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, finalizing sum m+n, thinking: We have the system of equations in terms of a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z):\n1) a - b - c = 1/2\n2) b - a - c = 1/3\n3) c - a - b = 1/4\nAdding all three gives: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\nSimplifying the left side: a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = - (a + b + c)\nRight side sum: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12\nSo, - (a + b + c) = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12\nUsing equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nSubstitute b + c = (a + b + c) - a = -13/12 - a\nSo, a - (-13/12 - a) = 1/2 => 2a + 13/12 = 1/2 => 2a = 1/2 - 13/12 = -7/12 => a = -7/24\nUsing equation (2): b - a - c = 1/3\nSubstitute a + c = (a + b + c) - b = -13/12 - b\nSo, b - (-13/12 - b) = 1/3 => 2b + 13/12 = 1/3 => 2b = 1/3 - 13/12 = -9/12 => b = -3/8\nUsing equation (3): c - a - b = 1/4\nSubstitute a + b = (a + b + c) - c = -13/12 - c\nSo, c - (-13/12 - c) = 1/4 => 2c + 13/12 = 1/4 => 2c = 1/4 - 13/12 = -10/12 => c = -5/12\nNow compute 4a + 3b + 2c:\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -7/6\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -5/6\nSum = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6\nConvert to common denominator 24:\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\nSum = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8\nAbsolute value is 25/8, which is in simplest form since 25 and 8 are coprime.\nTherefore, m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.\nThis confirms the correctness of the simplification and final sum. Hence, the final answer is 33.; answer: 33', iteration_idx=-1)]
