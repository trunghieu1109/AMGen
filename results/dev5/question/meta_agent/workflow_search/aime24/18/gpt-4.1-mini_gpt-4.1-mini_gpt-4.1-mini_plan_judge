Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The problem states that the unique point C on segment AB that does not lie on any other segment from the family F except AB itself corresponds to the parameter s = 3/4 in the parametrization C(s) = ((1 - s)/2, s * sqrt(3)/2). Calculating OC^2, we have OC^2 = ((1 - s)^2 + 3 s^2)/4. Substituting s = 3/4, OC^2 = (1 - 2*(3/4) + 4*(9/16))/4 = (1 - 1.5 + 2.25)/4 = 1.75/4 = 7/16. Since 7 and 16 are coprime, the fraction is in simplest form. Therefore, p = 7 and q = 16, and the sum p + q = 23. This matches the geometric and algebraic conditions established, confirming the correctness of the result.
