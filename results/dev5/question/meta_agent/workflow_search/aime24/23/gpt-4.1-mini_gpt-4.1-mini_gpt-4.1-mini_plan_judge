Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: The problem reduces to finding all digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) with digits 0-9 such that (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From the first equation, the digit pairs satisfy a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9. Substituting into the second equation yields a + b + c = 8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit â‰¤ 9 is C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), all valid digits. The example grid (0,0,8,9,9,1) fits these constraints. Sampling other solutions confirms the sums hold. Thus, the total number of distinct digit placements satisfying the conditions is 45. This count is verified by the example and by testing multiple sample solutions, confirming correctness and completeness of the solution set.

Answer:The total number of distinct digit placements in the 2x3 grid satisfying the given sum conditions is 45, and this count has been verified by cross-checking the example and reapplying constraints to sample solutions.

proposed answer: The problem reduces to finding all digit triples (a,b,c) where each digit is between 0 and 9, such that a + b + c = 8. Given that d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, and f = 9 - c, the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit <= 9 is given by the combination formula C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10, 2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid digit placement in the grid. Therefore, the total number of valid digit placements is 45.
