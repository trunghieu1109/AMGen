From these, it follows that a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9. Since each digit is between 0 and 9, and d, e, f are determined by a, b, c respectively, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999. The sum of a, b, c must be 8 because the total sum is 999 and the digit-wise sums are 9. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit between 0 and 9 is C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10, 2) = 45. Therefore, there are 45 valid digit assignments.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent kpzU:\nThe problem reduces to finding all digit triples (a,b,c) such that a,b,c are digits 0-9, and the sums a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 hold with d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, and the total sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999. This implies a+b+c=8. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with each digit <=9 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple leads to a unique solution for the grid. Thus, there are 45 valid digit placements.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vDcr:\nThe problem reduces to finding all digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) in the 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by rows equals 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by columns equals 99. Analyzing the digit-wise addition with no carry leads to the conditions a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, with a,b,c,d,e,f in [0,9]. Since d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999, which implies (a+b+c)+(d+e+f) = 27, but since d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, the sum a+b+c + (9-a)+(9-b)+(9-c) = 27 simplifies to 27 = 27, so no extra constraint. However, considering the sum of the row numbers: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999, substituting d,e,f, leads to the condition a+b+c = 8. Counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with digits 0-9 is combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique solution.

The sum of these three numbers is 99. Given the constraints a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, we deduce d + e + f = 27 - 8 = 19. The sum of the units digits (d + e + f) is 19, which means the units digit of the total sum is 9 and there is a carry of 1 to the tens place. The tens digits sum to a + b + c = 8, and adding the carry 1 gives 9, matching the tens digit of the total sum 99. This carry analysis confirms that the digit pairs (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must each sum to 9, and the top row digits (a,b,c) sum to 8. Since digits are from 0 to 9, all triples (a,b,c) with digits summing to 8 and their complements (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c) satisfy the carry and sum constraints. No further restrictions arise from carry considerations, so all such triples are valid. This rigorous carry analysis prevents overcounting and ensures correctness by confirming the addition rules are met exactly.; answer - The carryover analysis for the column sums shows that the units digits d, e, f sum to 19, producing a units digit 9 and a carry of 1 to the tens place. The tens digits a, b, c sum to 8, and adding the carry 1 yields 9, matching the tens digit of the total sum 99. Each digit pair (a,d), (b,e), and (c,f) sums to 9. Therefore, all triples (a,b,c) with digits from 0 to 9 summing to 8, paired with their complements (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), satisfy the carry and sum constraints. This carry analysis rigorously confirms the validity of these digit assignments and excludes no triples beyond these sum constraints.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem reduces to finding all digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. From the analysis, the key constraints are: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, with all digits between 0 and 9. Substituting d, e, f in terms of a, b, c into the row sum equation shows it is always satisfied. The column sum condition reduces to a + b + c = 8. Therefore, the problem is to count the number of non-negative integer triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8. Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound constraints are violated. The number of such triples is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid assignment (a,b,c,d,e,f) with d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c. Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.

For example, consider (a,b,c) = (0,0,8), then (d,e,f) = (9,9,1). The row sums are 008 + 991 = 999, and the column sums are 09 + 09 + 81 = 99, which satisfies the conditions. Another example, (a,b,c) = (1,3,4), then (d,e,f) = (8,6,5). Row sums: 134 + 865 = 999; column sums: 18 + 36 + 45 = 99, also valid. Testing multiple such samples confirms that the sum conditions hold without any carry conflicts or digit violations. The constraints a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9 ensure digit-wise addition without carry, making all such assignments valid. Since the counting of solutions is based on the number of non-negative integer triples (a,b,c) summing to 8, and all such triples produce valid solutions, no erroneous candidates exist. Therefore, the total count of 45 valid digit assignments is correct and complete.; answer - The verification confirms that all 45 enumerated solutions satisfy the sum conditions with proper digit-wise addition and no carry conflicts.

The verification shows that these conditions imply a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9, with no carry in addition. Since a,b,c,d,e,f are digits 0-9, and d,e,f are determined by a,b,c as d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that a+b+c=8 (because the sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999, and the digit-wise sums are 9, so the sum of a,b,c must be 8). The number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with each digit between 0 and 9 is the number of combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

The sum is:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 10*8 + (d + e + f).\n\nSince d + e + f = (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c) = 27 - 8 = 19, the total sum is 80 + 19 = 99, consistent with the problem.\n\nNow, we perform digit-wise addition with carries:\n\nAdd the units digits: d + e + f\nAdd the tens digits: a + b + c plus any carry from units addition\n\nSince the sum is 99, the units digit is 9 and the tens digit is 9.\n\nLet carry from units addition to tens be C (0 or 1 since max sum of units digits is 27).\n\nUnits digit sum: d + e + f = 19\nUnits digit of sum: 9\nThus, 19 mod 10 = 9, so units digit matches.\nCarry C = floor(19 / 10) = 1\n\nTens digit sum: a + b + c + C = 8 + 1 = 9\nTens digit of sum: 9\nMatches perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the carry from units to tens place is exactly 1.\n\nThis carry implies the units sum d + e + f must be 19.\n\nGiven a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, we have d + e + f = 27 - 8 = 19.\n\nHence, the digit pairs (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must satisfy:\n- Each pair sums to 9\n- The top row digits sum to 8\n- The bottom row digits sum to 19\n\nSince all digits are from 0 to 9, the pairs (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) are complements to 9.\n\nNo other carry possibilities exist because the units sum must be 19 to get units digit 9 and carry 1.\n\nTherefore, the valid triples (a,b,c) are all triples of digits 0 to 8 (since a+b+c=8) and their complements (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c).\n\nNo further exclusions from carry conditions are necessary because the carry analysis confirms the sums and carries are consistent.\n\nHence, all triples (a,b,c) with digits in 0..8 summing to 8 are valid, and their complements (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c) form valid bottom row digits.\n\nThis carry analysis excludes no triples beyond the sum constraints, ensuring correctness and avoiding overcounting.\n\nIn summary, the carry analysis confirms the constraints and validates all digit triples (a,b,c) summing to 8 with digits 0 to 8, paired with (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c), satisfy the addition rules for the column sums.; answer: The carry analysis for the column sums shows that the units digits sum to 19, producing a units digit 9 and a carry of 1 to the tens place. The tens digits plus carry sum to 9, matching the tens digit of the total 99. This confirms the digit pairs (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must each sum to 9, and the top row digits (a,b,c) sum to 8. Since digits are 0-9, all triples (a,b,c) with digits summing to 8 and their complements (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c) satisfy the carry and sum constraints. Therefore, all such triples are valid under the carry conditions, and no additional restrictions exclude any triples beyond these sum constraints.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent XMgq, round 0, carry analysis, thinking: We analyze the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by columns: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Grouping tens and units digits, we get 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. From the previous sub-task, a + b + c = 8 and since a + d = b + e = c + f = 9, then d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c) = 19. However, this contradicts the sum because 10*8 + 19 = 99 is false (10*8=80, 80+19=99, which is true). So the sum 99 is verified. But to understand carry propagation, consider the addition column-wise:\n\nEach column sum is (a + d), (b + e), (c + f) = 9 each, with no carry from their sum since 9 < 10. The units digits are d, e, f and the tens digits are a, b, c. When summing the units digits d + e + f, the maximum is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, which can produce a carry to the tens place.\n\nLet carry from units to tens be C (0,1, or 2 since max 27). Sum of units digits (d + e + f) = U, sum of tens digits (a + b + c) = 8. The total sum is 10*8 + U = 99, so U = 19. Since U = 19, units sum is 19, which means carry C = 1 (since 19 = 10*1 + 9 units digit).\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the total sum is 9, and the tens digit is 9 + carry from units addition (which is 1), but the total tens digit is 9, so the carry must be accounted for correctly.\n\nThis implies the units digits sum to 19, carry 1 to tens, and tens digits sum to 8 plus carry 1 equals 9 (tens digit of total sum).\n\nHence, the carry analysis shows the units digits d, e, f must sum to 19, and the tens digits a, b, c sum to 8. Since each pair sums to 9, each digit pair (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must satisfy a + d = 9, etc. The only way for d + e + f = 19 with digits 0-9 and d = 9 - a, etc., is to find triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c = 8 such that the complementary digits d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c sum to 19. \n\nEnumerating all triples (a,b,c) with sum 8 and verifying which yield d+e+f=19 (i.e., 27 - 8) confirms the valid digit triples. This carry analysis filters out invalid triples that do not meet the sum and carry conditions. Thus, the valid (a,b,c) triples are those with sum 8 and their complements sum to 19, ensuring the column sums and carry logic hold.\n\nIn conclusion, the carry analysis confirms the constraints from sub-task 1 and excludes invalid digit assignments that would violate addition rules. The valid triples (a,b,c) are those with sum 8 and corresponding (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c) summing to 19, ensuring the total column sum is 99 with correct carry propagation.; answer: The detailed carry analysis for the column sums shows that the units digits d, e, f must sum to 19 (units sum), producing a carry of 1 to the tens place. The tens digits a, b, c sum to 8, and adding the carry 1 yields the tens digit 9 of the total sum 99. Each digit pair (a,d), (b,e), and (c,f) satisfies a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9. Valid triples (a,b,c) are those with sum 8 whose complements (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c) sum to 19, ensuring the sum of the three two-digit column numbers is exactly 99 with proper carry propagation. This carry analysis rigorously excludes invalid digit assignments that do not satisfy the addition rules.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, synthesizing carryover analysis, thinking: The problem requires analyzing the sum of three two-digit numbers formed by the columns of a 2x3 digit grid, where each column forms a number (10a + d), (10b + e), and (10c + f). The sum of these three numbers is 99. Given the constraints a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, we deduce d + e + f = 27 - 8 = 19. The sum of the units digits (d + e + f) is 19, which means the units digit of the total sum is 9 and there is a carry of 1 to the tens place. The tens digits sum to a + b + c = 8, and adding the carry 1 gives 9, matching the tens digit of the total sum 99. This carry analysis confirms that the digit pairs (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) must each sum to 9, and the top row digits (a,b,c) sum to 8. Since digits are from 0 to 9, all triples (a,b,c) with digits summing to 8 and their complements (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c) satisfy the carry and sum constraints. No further restrictions arise from carry considerations, so all such triples are valid. This rigorous carry analysis prevents overcounting and ensures correctness by confirming the addition rules are met exactly.; answer: The carryover analysis for the column sums shows that the units digits d, e, f sum to 19, producing a units digit 9 and a carry of 1 to the tens place. The tens digits a, b, c sum to 8, and adding the carry 1 yields 9, matching the tens digit of the total sum 99. Each digit pair (a,d), (b,e), and (c,f) sums to 9. Therefore, all triples (a,b,c) with digits from 0 to 9 summing to 8, paired with their complements (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), satisfy the carry and sum constraints. This carry analysis rigorously confirms the validity of these digit assignments and excludes no triples beyond these sum constraints.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent IcUp, enumerating valid digit assignments, thinking: Given the constraints derived from the problem and the carryover analysis, we have the following key conditions:\n- a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9 (each column's digits sum to 9)\n- a + b + c = 8 (sum of the top row digits)\n- The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999.\n\nFrom the row sum: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.\nSubstitute d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c:\n(100a + 10b + c) + (100(9 - a) + 10(9 - b) + (9 - c)) = 999\n=> 100a + 10b + c + 900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 9 - c = 999\n=> (100a - 100a) + (10b - 10b) + (c - c) + 900 + 90 + 9 = 999\n=> 999 = 999\n\nThis means the row sum constraint is automatically satisfied by the column sum constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only constraints to satisfy are:\n- a, b, c are digits 0-9 with sum 8\n- d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c\n- All digits are between 0 and 9.\n\nThe problem reduces to counting the number of non-negative integer triples (a,b,c) with each digit 0-9, sum to 8.\n\nNumber of solutions to a+b+c=8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 9 is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.\n\nAll these solutions produce valid (d,e,f) since 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c are all digits 0-9.\n\nHence, the total number of valid digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) satisfying all constraints is 45.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent m67V, enumerating valid digit assignments, thinking: From the carry analysis and problem constraints, we have the following key conditions: (1) Each column digit pair sums to 9: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, (2) The sum of the top row digits is 8: a + b + c = 8, (3) The row sums must satisfy (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. Substituting d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c into the row sum equation gives: (100a + 10b + c) + (100(9 - a) + 10(9 - b) + (9 - c)) = 999. Simplifying this: (100a + 10b + c) + (900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 9 - c) = 999, which reduces to 999 = 999, always true. So the row sum condition is automatically satisfied once the column pairs sum to 9. The column sum condition (sum of column-formed two-digit numbers) is 99, which is satisfied by the carry analysis and the digit pair sums. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all triples (a,b,c) of digits from 0 to 9 such that a + b + c = 8, and then setting (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). Each such assignment produces a valid solution. The number of such triples is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9. Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound constraints affect the count. The number of solutions is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Hence, there are 45 valid digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) satisfying all constraints. This method avoids brute force by leveraging sum and carry constraints, ensuring correctness and completeness.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent BM7a, enumerating valid digit assignments, thinking: We have the constraints: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, with digits from 0 to 9. Since each pair sums to 9, d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. The row sum constraint is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. Substituting d, e, f gives (100a + 10b + c) + (100(9 - a) + 10(9 - b) + (9 - c)) = 999. Simplifying, we get 100a + 10b + c + 900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 9 - c = 999, which simplifies to 999 = 999, an identity. This means the row sum constraint is always satisfied if the column sum constraints are met. The column sum constraint is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Substituting d, e, f, we get (10a + 9 - a) + (10b + 9 - b) + (10c + 9 - c) = 99, which simplifies to 9a + 9b + 9c + 27 = 99, so 9(a + b + c) = 72, and thus a + b + c = 8. Therefore, the only real constraint is that a, b, c are digits 0-9 summing to 8, and d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. We count the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9. Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound is violated. The number of solutions is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Hence, there are 45 valid assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f).; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, synthesizing enumeration, thinking: The problem reduces to finding all digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. From the analysis, the key constraints are: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, with all digits between 0 and 9. Substituting d, e, f in terms of a, b, c into the row sum equation shows it is always satisfied. The column sum condition reduces to a + b + c = 8. Therefore, the problem is to count the number of non-negative integer triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8. Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound constraints are violated. The number of such triples is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid assignment (a,b,c,d,e,f) with d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c. Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45. This matches the answers given by multiple chain-of-thought agents and is consistent with the problem constraints and example.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 70D5, verifying enumerated solutions, thinking: To verify the correctness of the enumerated solutions, we sample representative digit assignments from the solution set where a + b + c = 8 and d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. For example, consider (a,b,c) = (0,0,8), then (d,e,f) = (9,9,1). The row sums are 008 + 991 = 999, and the column sums are 09 + 09 + 81 = 99, which satisfies the conditions. Another example, (a,b,c) = (1,3,4), then (d,e,f) = (8,6,5). Row sums: 134 + 865 = 999; column sums: 18 + 36 + 45 = 99, also valid. Testing multiple such samples confirms that the sum conditions hold without any carry conflicts or digit violations. The constraints a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9 ensure digit-wise addition without carry, making all such assignments valid. Since the counting of solutions is based on the number of non-negative integer triples (a,b,c) summing to 8, and all such triples produce valid solutions, no erroneous candidates exist. Therefore, the total count of 45 valid digit assignments is correct and complete.; answer: The verification confirms that all 45 enumerated solutions satisfy the sum conditions with proper digit-wise addition and no carry conflicts. Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments in the 2x3 grid is 45.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent yHkL, feedback: The solution correctly identifies the constraints and the relationship between the digits in the grid. It uses the key insight that for the row sums to be 999 and the column sums to be 99, the digits must satisfy a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9, ensuring no carry in addition. The solution enumerates all triples (a,b,c) of digits summing to 8, and for each, determines (d,e,f) accordingly. The verification step samples multiple solutions and confirms the sums hold, and the counting of such triples is correctly computed as 45. The solution assumes leading zeros are allowed, which is consistent with the example given. No overlooked invalid solutions or carry conflicts are found. Therefore, the solution is complete and correct with no apparent limitations.; correct: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent gLeC, aggregating valid assignments, thinking: From the problem and the verification in Sub-task 2, the key constraints are that the digits in the top row (a,b,c) and bottom row (d,e,f) satisfy the equations: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. The verification shows that these conditions imply a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9, with no carry in addition. Since a,b,c,d,e,f are digits 0-9, and d,e,f are determined by a,b,c as d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that a+b+c=8 (because the sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999, and the digit-wise sums are 9, so the sum of a,b,c must be 8). The number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with each digit between 0 and 9 is the number of combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid solution. Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 2NZv, formatting final output, thinking: Given the problem constraints and analysis, the digits in the grid must satisfy the equations: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From these, it follows that a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9. Since each digit is between 0 and 9, and d, e, f are determined by a, b, c respectively, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999. The sum of a, b, c must be 8 because the total sum is 999 and the digit-wise sums are 9. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit between 0 and 9 is C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10, 2) = 45.

This implies a+b+c=8. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with each digit <=9 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple leads to a unique solution for the grid.

Analyzing the digit-wise addition with no carry leads to the conditions a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, with a,b,c,d,e,f in [0,9]. Since d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999, which implies (a+b+c)+(d+e+f) = 27, but since d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, the sum a+b+c + (9-a)+(9-b)+(9-c) = 27 simplifies to 27 = 27, so no extra constraint. However, considering the sum of the row numbers: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999, substituting d,e,f, leads to the condition a+b+c = 8. Counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with digits 0-9 is combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique solution.
