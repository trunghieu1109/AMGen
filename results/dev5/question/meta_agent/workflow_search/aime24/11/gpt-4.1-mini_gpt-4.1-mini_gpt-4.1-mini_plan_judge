Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the paths with exactly four direction changes consist of 5 monotone segments alternating between R and U. The starting direction can be either R or U. 

- If the path starts with R, then there are 3 R segments and 2 U segments. The number of ways to compose 8 into 3 positive parts is C(7,2) = 21, and the number of ways to compose 8 into 2 positive parts is C(7,1) = 7. Thus, the number of such paths starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.

- If the path starts with U, then there are 3 U segments and 2 R segments. Similarly, the number of ways to compose 8 into 3 parts is 21, and into 2 parts is 7. The number of such paths starting with U is also 21 * 7 = 147.

Since these two cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294.

This count is consistent with the combinatorial reasoning and avoids double counting because the starting direction uniquely determines the pattern of segments. The compositions count all possible positive integer partitions of the steps in each segment, ensuring all valid paths are counted.

Therefore, the final answer is 294.
