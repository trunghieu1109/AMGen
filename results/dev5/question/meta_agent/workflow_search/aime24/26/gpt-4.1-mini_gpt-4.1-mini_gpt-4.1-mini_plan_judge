Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: The problem states that Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A, and the total number of such sets is 2024. For each element a in A, the number of subsets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1). Therefore, the sum over all a in A of 2^(a-1) equals 2024. Expressing 2024 in binary and decomposing it into powers of two, we find the set A corresponds to the exponents plus one: A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. Summing these elements gives 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. Verifying, the sum of 2^(a-1) for these elements equals 2024, confirming the correctness. Hence, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
