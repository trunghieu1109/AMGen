Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_6
proposed answer: The problem requires verifying the final answer for r^2 = p/q where r is the radius of the smallest sphere containing all boxes in set B with surface area 54 and volume 23. From previous analysis, the maximum space diagonal squared d^2 was found to be 657/16. Since r = d/2, we have r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. The numerator 657 factors as 3^2 * 73, and the denominator 64 is 2^6, so they share no common factors, confirming the fraction is in lowest terms. The sum p + q = 657 + 64 = 721. The constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23 are satisfied by the dimensions found during the optimization process that yielded d^2 = 657/16, confirming the maximum diagonal length corresponds to the minimal enclosing sphere radius. Therefore, the final answer p + q = 721 is correct and consistent with all problem conditions.
