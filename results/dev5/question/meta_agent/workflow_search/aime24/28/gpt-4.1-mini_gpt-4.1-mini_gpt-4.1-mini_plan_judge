Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous detailed analysis and calculations, the difference between the radii of the two tangent circles on the torus, r_i - r_o, simplifies to the fraction 36/11 in lowest terms. Here, m = 36 and n = 11, which are relatively prime positive integers. The problem asks for m + n, which is 36 + 11 = 47. This result is consistent with the geometric interpretation and algebraic derivations of the problem, confirming no logical or computational errors remain. Therefore, the final answer is 47.
