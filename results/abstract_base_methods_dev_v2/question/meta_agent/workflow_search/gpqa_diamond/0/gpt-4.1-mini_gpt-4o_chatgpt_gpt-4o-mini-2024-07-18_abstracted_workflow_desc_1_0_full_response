The choice of triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c\':9,10-c\'\']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone as the molecule with C3h symmetry is justified by its structural similarity to triphenylene, which is known to have C3h symmetry due to its planar structure and symmetric distribution of functional groups. However, the limitation of this determination is that it relies on the assumption that the complex polycyclic structure retains the symmetry elements of the parent triphenylene structure. Without detailed structural analysis or computational modeling, there is a possibility that the additional functional groups or modifications could disrupt the symmetry. Therefore, while the choice is reasonable, it should be verified with further structural analysis.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the symmetry analyses from subtask_2, compare and determine which molecule(s) exhibit C3h symmetry.
