Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_17_11
proposed answer: All agents agree that the calculated kinetic energies for the mu(+) and neutrino are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. These values match the option provided in choice 4 of the original question. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer that corresponds to these kinetic energies is choice D. The consistency across all agents' reasoning and the match with the given choices confirm that D is the correct answer.
