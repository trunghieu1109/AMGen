After the decay, the total energy is distributed between the muon (mu(+)) and the neutrino (nu). The rest mass energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV.

From Sub-task 4, we know that the total energy of the stationary Pi(+) particle is 139.6 MeV, which is its rest mass energy. According to the conservation of energy, the total energy before decay (E_initial) must equal the total energy after decay, which is the sum of the energies of mu(+) and the neutrino. Therefore, we have the equation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu, where E_mu is the total energy of the muon and E_nu is the energy of the neutrino. From Sub-task 3, we know E_mu = sqrt((p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2) and E_nu = p_nu c. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is purely kinetic. By conservation of momentum, the momentum of the muon (p_mu) must equal the momentum of the neutrino (p_nu), thus p_mu = p_nu.
