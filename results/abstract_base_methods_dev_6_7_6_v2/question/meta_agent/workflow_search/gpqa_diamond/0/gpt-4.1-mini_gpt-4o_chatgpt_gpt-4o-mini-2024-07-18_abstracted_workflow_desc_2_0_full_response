For two states with different lifetimes, the energy uncertainties are calculated separately, and the minimum resolvable energy difference is typically considered to be greater than the sum of these uncertainties. This approach assumes that the energy levels can be resolved if their separation exceeds the combined linewidths. However, this method has limitations: it assumes ideal conditions without considering experimental factors such as instrumental resolution, noise, and other broadening effects that might affect the actual resolvability of the energy levels.
