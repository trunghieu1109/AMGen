Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_0
proposed answer: The task is to select the correct multiple-choice option that corresponds to the energy difference allowing clear resolution of two quantum states. The minimum energy difference required for clear resolution was calculated to be greater than 7.2402 Ã— 10^-7 eV. Comparing this with the options: A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-8 eV, and D) 10^-4 eV, only option D (10^-4 eV) is greater than the calculated minimum. Therefore, option D is the only choice that meets the resolution criterion.
