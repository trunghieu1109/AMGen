Question: Example(question='A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons.

The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4.

proposed answer: The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons behave as if they are free particles during interactions. This requires certain assumptions: 1) The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons, 2) The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon, and 4) The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. These assumptions ensure that the nucleon is treated as isolated and unaffected by the nuclear environment, which is the essence of the impulse approximation. Assumption 3, regarding non-relativistic quarks, is not necessary for this approximation. Therefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4, which corresponds to choice 4 (1,2,4). All debate agents agree on this conclusion, and choice 4 is the correct answer.
