Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The derived energy spectrum expression from Sub-task 3 is E = (2n_x + 3n_y + 1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This expression was compared against the multiple-choice options provided in the original question. The options are: 1) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m), 2) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m), 3) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m), 4) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Upon comparison, option 2 matches exactly with the derived expression. All debate agents agree that the correct formula for the energy spectrum is given by option 2. Therefore, the final decision is that the correct energy spectrum formula is option 2.

proposed answer: The derived energy spectrum expression is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏsqrt(k/m). Upon comparing this with the provided multiple-choice options, we find that Choice 1: E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m) matches exactly with the derived expression. The other choices have different coefficients for n_x, n_y, or the constant term, and therefore do not match the derived expression. All agents agree that Choice 1 is the correct match. Therefore, the final decision is that the correct energy spectrum formula is given by Choice 1.
