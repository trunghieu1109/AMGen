Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The majority of the debate agents (BdxX, Nzo2, and Iyqo) concluded that choice D is the most accurate conclusion based on the experimental data. They all agree that G2 is likely the transcription factor, as its knockout results in a complete loss of resistance, indicating its upstream regulatory role. They also agree that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, as both contribute to resistance but through different mechanisms, and that G1 is epistatic towards G3, as the double mutant g1g3 shows significantly reduced resistance compared to the single mutants. Agent cMqF suggested choice A, but the reasoning aligns more with the consensus that G2 is the transcription factor and the interactions between G1 and G3 involve pleiotropy and epistasis. Therefore, choice D is the most supported and accurate conclusion.

proposed answer: All agents agree that G2 is most likely a transcription factor, as its knock-out results in 0% resistance, indicating its upstream regulatory role. The analysis of the g1g3 double mutant suggests that G1 and G3 have a combined effect on resistance, possibly indicating pleiotropy or partial redundancy, but not full redundancy or simple epistasis. Choice 4 correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor and suggests a complex interaction between G1 and G3, which aligns with the observed data better than the other options. Although the notion of G1 being epistatic towards G3 is not fully supported, choice 4 is the closest to the validated conclusions, acknowledging the transcription factor role of G2 and the complex interaction of G1 and G3.
