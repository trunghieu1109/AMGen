Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_16
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the free Ca²⁺ ion concentration to be 6.3x10^-7 M. This value matches option C) 6.3x10^-7 M from the provided multiple-choice options. Each agent has confirmed that option C is the correct answer based on their calculations and comparisons. Therefore, the final decision is that the correct multiple-choice answer is C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
