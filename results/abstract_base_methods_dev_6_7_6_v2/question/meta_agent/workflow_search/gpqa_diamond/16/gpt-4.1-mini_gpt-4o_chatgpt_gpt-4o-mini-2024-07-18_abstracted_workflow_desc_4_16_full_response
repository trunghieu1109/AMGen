The stability constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex from Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Therefore, the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the inverse of the formation constant. The dissociation constant (K_d) is 1/K_Ca-EDTA = 1/(5x10^10).

Thus, at equilibrium, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions will be x, and the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ ions will also be x, since the stoichiometry of the dissociation is 1:1. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex at equilibrium will be 0.02 - x. Therefore, we set up the equilibrium concentrations as follows: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x.; answer - [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1, we know the dissociation equilibrium is Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻, and the dissociation constant K_d = 1/(5x10^10).

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Given that the dissociation constant is very small (1/(5x10^10)), we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, allowing us to approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Substituting this approximation into the equation gives 1/(5x10^10) ≈ x^2 / 0.02. Solving for x, we get x^2 = 0.02 / (5x10^10), which simplifies to x^2 = 4x10^-13.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.
