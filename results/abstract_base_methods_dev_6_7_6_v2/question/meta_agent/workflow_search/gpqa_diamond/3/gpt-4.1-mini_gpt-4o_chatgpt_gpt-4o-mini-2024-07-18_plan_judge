proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the classical Maxwell's equations are modified. Specifically, Gauss's law for magnetism changes from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = ρ_m, accounting for the divergence of the magnetic field. Additionally, the Ampère-Maxwell law changes from ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t) to ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t) + μ₀J_m, accounting for the curl of the magnetic field. These modifications correspond to changes in the equations related to the divergence and curl of the magnetic field. Comparing this with the multiple-choice options, Choice 2 mentions both divergence and curl of the magnetic field, which aligns with the changes identified. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that mentions both divergence and curl of the magnetic field.

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell's equations that are modified are the divergence of the magnetic field and the curl of the electric field. The divergence of the magnetic field equation changes from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = μ₀ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. The curl of the electric field, which is related to Faraday's law, is also modified to include a term for magnetic current density, changing to ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that identifies these two changes, which is choice 3: 'The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.'
