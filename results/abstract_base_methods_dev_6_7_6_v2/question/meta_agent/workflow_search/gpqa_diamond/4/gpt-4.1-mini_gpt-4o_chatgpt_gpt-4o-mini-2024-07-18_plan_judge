Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n', choice1='(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028', choice2='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)', choice3='(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n', choice4='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The normalized eigenvector obtained from the previous sub-task is (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)). We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct match. The options are: 1) (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin (\theta)), 2) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar), 3) (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2)), and 4) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2)). Option 1 involves a complex exponential and uses \cos(\theta) instead of \cos(\theta/2), so it does not match. Option 2 contains \hbar terms and specific numerical coefficients, which do not match the form we have. Option 3 exactly matches the form of the normalized eigenvector we obtained, (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)). Option 4 also contains \hbar terms and specific coefficients, which are not present in our normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the correct choice is Option 3.
