Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_6
proposed answer: All the debate agents have calculated the threshold energy for the gamma-ray photon required for pair production with a CMB photon to be 2.6 * 10^5 GeV. This value matches exactly with choice3 in the provided multiple-choice options. Each agent independently verified that choice3 corresponds to the calculated threshold energy. Therefore, the consensus among the agents is that choice3 is the correct option. Given this consistent agreement and the exact match of the calculated value with choice3, the best matching multiple-choice option is indeed choice3.
