proposed answer: The transit probability for a planet is determined by the formula: transit probability ≈ (R_star / a), where R_star is the radius of the host star and a is the orbital semi-major axis. Given that both host stars have the same radii, the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis. Using Kepler's third law, we know that the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period and the mass of the host star. Since Planet_1 has an orbital period that is three times shorter than Planet_2 and its host star has twice the mass, the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller. Specifically, the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times that of Planet_2. This results in a transit probability ratio of (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65, meaning Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred choice for observation based on the highest transit probability.

Answer:Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

proposed answer: Based on the analysis, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting compared to Planet_2. The calculated transit probability ratio for Planet_1 is approximately 1.44 times higher than that of Planet_2. Among the given choices, choice 1 states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit, which is the closest match to the calculated ratio. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1, as it has the highest verified transit probability. The corresponding multiple-choice answer letter for this choice is A).
