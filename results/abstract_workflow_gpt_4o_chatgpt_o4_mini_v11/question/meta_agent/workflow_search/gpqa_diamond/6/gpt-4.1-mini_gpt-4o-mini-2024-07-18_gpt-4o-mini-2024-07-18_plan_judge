Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_6
proposed answer: The threshold energy for gamma-ray photons interacting with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs is calculated using the formula E_threshold = 2 * m_e c^2 / (1 - (E_CMB / E_gamma)). The rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV, leading to a total energy requirement of about 1.022 MeV for pair production. Given that the average energy of CMB photons is 10^-3 eV, the calculated threshold energy comes out to approximately 9.5 * 10^4 GeV. This value directly corresponds to choice A) from the provided options. Therefore, gamma-ray photons with energies below this threshold would have their lifetimes limited due to the pair production process with CMB photons, making choice A) the correct answer.
