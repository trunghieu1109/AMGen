proposed answer: To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +hbar/2 for the operator P along the direction n in the x-z plane, we first express the operator as P = (hbar/2)(cos(theta) P_x + sin(theta) P_z). The eigenvalue equation is then (P - (hbar/2)I)v = 0, where I is the identity matrix. Substituting the expressions for P_x and P_z, we can set up the matrix equation and solve for the eigenvector components. After solving, we find that the normalized eigenvector can be expressed in terms of theta as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). This matches with choice 3 from the provided options, confirming that it is the correct representation of the eigenvector.

Answer:(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))
Extracted answer: (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))
