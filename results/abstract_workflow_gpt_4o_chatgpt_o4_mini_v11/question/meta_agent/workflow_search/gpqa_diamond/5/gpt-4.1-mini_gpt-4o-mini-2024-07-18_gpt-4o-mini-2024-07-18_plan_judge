proposed answer: After analyzing the derived energy spectrum for the 2D quantum harmonic oscillator, which is E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m), I compared it with the provided multiple-choice options. The options presented are structured differently, focusing on combinations of n_x and n_y with varying coefficients. The closest option that resembles the structure of our derived expression is option 1, E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Although it does not match exactly, it can be interpreted as a compatible form when considering the quantum numbers. Therefore, I conclude that option A is the most appropriate choice, as it aligns best with the derived energy spectrum despite not being an exact match.
