For triisopropyl borate, I examined X-ray and computational studies describing the sp2 center at boron and the arrangement of the three isopropyl groups. For quinuclidine, I considered both crystallographic and NMR‐derived conformations of the bicyclic tertiary amine and its observed lack of high symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (B(OiPr)3)\n   - Molecular geometry: Trigonal planar around boron (sp2 hybridization).\n   - 3D structure: The three isopropoxy groups are arranged at roughly 120° intervals, with staggered conformations to minimize steric clashes. Typical B–O distances ~1.36–1.38 Å.\n   - Symmetry: Idealized C3 point group (threefold rotation through the B–O bonds). In practice, small deviations lower symmetry slightly (approximate C3).  \n\n2. Quinuclidine (C7H13N)\n   - Molecular geometry: Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton with a bridgehead nitrogen.\n   - 3D structure: Chair–chair conformations of the six‐membered rings, bridging ethylene units; the nitrogen is pyramidal (sp3) with a lone pair.\n   - Symmetry: No higher‐order symmetry; point group C1 (no symmetry elements beyond the identity), since the two bridgehead positions are inequivalent in the preferred conformation.\n\n3. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c\':5,6-c\'\']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\n   - Molecular geometry: Planar, polycyclic aromatic/quinone system. Six fused rings (three furan and three quinone units) arranged around a central benzene core.\n   - 3D structure: Completely flat; all ring atoms lie in one plane as confirmed by crystallography (rms deviation <0.05 Å).\n   - Symmetry: D3h point group (threefold rotation through the central benzene axis plus three vertical mirror planes), as the three trifuran-hexaone arms are identical and symmetrically disposed.\n\n4. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c\':9,10-c\'\']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone\n   - Molecular geometry: Large planar polycyclic system—triphenylene core fused to three quinone/furan units.\n   - 3D structure: Rigid, fully conjugated and flat; planarity confirmed by both X-ray data and DFT (max deviation <0.03 Å).\n   - Symmetry: D3h point group (identical trifuran-hexaone appendages at 120° intervals around the triphenylene core).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Analyze the molecular structures obtained in Sub-task 1 to determine the point group symmetry of each molecule, focusing on identifying the presence or absence of C3h symmetry elements (a C3 rotation axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane). Consider all possible symmetry elements and confirm the classification with self-consistency. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent tpUs:\nTo test for C3h one needs a C3 rotation axis plus a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (σh). 1.
