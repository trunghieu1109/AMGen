Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TiAN', content='To determine which energy difference option allows for the clear resolution of the two quantum states, we must compare each option against the calculated energy uncertainty. The larger uncertainty from the two states is approximately 6.59 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, any energy difference that is less than or equal to this value will not allow for clear distinction between the states. The options provided are: 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-4 eV. The first three options (10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, and 10^-8 eV) are all significantly smaller than 6.59 x 10^-7 eV, meaning they cannot be used to clearly resolve the two states. The only option that exceeds this uncertainty is 10^-4 eV, which is much larger than 6.59 x 10^-7 eV.

We will calculate ΔE for both lifetimes: 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec. For Δt = 10^-9 sec, ΔE = ħ / (10^-9) = (1.055 x 10^-34) / (10^-9) = 1.055 x 10^-25 J. Converting this to eV (1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J), we get ΔE ≈ 6.59 x 10^-7 eV. For Δt = 10^-8 sec, ΔE = ħ / (10^-8) = (1.055 x 10^-34) / (10^-8) = 1.055 x 10^-26 J, which converts to ΔE ≈ 6.59 x 10^-8 eV.
