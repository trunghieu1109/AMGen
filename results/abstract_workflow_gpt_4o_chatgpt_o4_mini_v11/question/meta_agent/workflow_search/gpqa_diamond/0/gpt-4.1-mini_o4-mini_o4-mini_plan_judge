proposed answer: Comparing the point‐group assignments from Sub‐task 2: quinuclidine is C3v (C3 + three σv, no σh); triisopropyl borate is C3 (only a C3 axis, no mirror planes); triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is D3h (C3 + σh + σv + C2′ axes); benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is planar with a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) but lacks vertical mirror planes (σv), matching exactly the symmetry requirements for C3h.

proposed answer: Among the four candidates only triisopropyl borate has the full set of C₃h symmetry elements under idealized conditions. The boron center is trigonal‐planar with three identical isopropoxy groups spaced at 120°, establishing a principal C₃ axis through B perpendicular to the O–B–O plane. That plane itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h). In contrast, quinuclidine is a puckered bicyclic cage lacking any C₃ axis or σ_h; the two large polycyclic hexaones, although planar, do not have exact threefold rotational equivalence of all substituents nor a true σ_h perpendicular to a C₃ axis. Therefore triisopropyl borate uniquely fulfills the textbook definition of C₃h symmetry.

proposed answer: We evaluated the full point‐group symmetry of each molecule. Quinuclidine is C3v (it has three vertical mirror planes but no horizontal plane), triisopropyl borate is only C3 (it lacks any mirror plane), and both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone are planar D3h species. Although the latter two contain a three‐fold rotation axis plus a horizontal mirror plane (elements of C3h), they also possess additional C2 axes and vertical mirror planes that elevate their full point group to D3h. Therefore, none of the four molecules has C3h as its complete point‐group symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires exactly one C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it, with no additional symmetry elements. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar B(OR)3 core: the three identical isopropoxy groups around boron provide a single C3 axis through B and a σh in the plane of the B–O bonds, and there are no extra C2 axes or vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine lacks any C3 axis or horizontal mirror. The two hexaone macrocycles are planar with a C3 axis but also have three vertical mirror planes (σv), placing them in D3h rather than C3h. Therefore, only triisopropyl borate exhibits pure C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: A molecule with C3h symmetry must have a single C3 rotational axis and one horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, but no vertical mirror planes (σv) or additional C2 axes. Quinuclidine is C3v (it has σv but no σh). Triisopropyl borate is C3 (lacking σh). The benzo-trifuran hexaone derivative is D3h (it has extra C2 axes and σv planes in addition to σh and C3). Only triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone exhibits exactly one C3 axis perpendicular to its plane and a single σh plane coincident with that plane, with no additional symmetry elements.

proposed answer: To exhibit C3h symmetry a molecule must have exactly one C3 rotational axis and one horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, but no vertical mirror planes (σv). Analysis of each candidate shows:
- Quinuclidine: C3 axis plus three σv planes → C3v.
- Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and its triphenyleno analogue: planar with C3 axis plus three σv planes as well as σh → D3h.
- Triisopropyl borate: trigonal-planar at boron with three identical isopropyl substituents; has a single C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and no vertical planes → pure C3h.
Therefore, only triisopropyl borate meets the criteria for C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: The C3h point group requires exactly one C3 axis and one horizontal mirror plane (σh), but no vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes. 

1. Quinuclidine is C3v: it has three σv planes but lacks a σh, so it does not match C3h.
2. The two fused polycyclic hexaones (benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones) are D3h: they have a σh, three σv planes, and three C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3, so they exceed the required symmetry for C3h.
3. Triisopropyl borate has one C3 axis through the boron and the plane of the three isopropyl groups serves as σh. It lacks any σv or perpendicular C2 axes, exactly matching C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: To have C3h symmetry, a molecule must have exactly one C3 rotation axis and one horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, with no vertical mirror planes (σv) or inversion center. Triisopropyl borate is planar with three identical isopropoxy groups arranged at 120° around boron; its molecular plane is σh, and the only other symmetry element is the C3 axis, giving it the six operations of C3h. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has a central triphenylene core with three identical furan-dione substituents at 120° in its plane; similarly, the ring plane is σh, and only the C3 axis is present, matching C3h. Quinuclidine has vertical mirror planes (C3v), and the benzo‐trifuran hexaone lacks a threefold axis with a perpendicular σh, so neither matches C3h.

proposed answer: A molecule with C3h symmetry must have a single C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, and must not possess any C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv). Triisopropyl borate (choice B) consists of an sp2-hybridized boron atom bonded to three identical isopropoxy groups arranged at 120° in a common plane. The C3 axis runs through the boron perpendicular to this group plane, which itself serves as the σh plane. There are no additional C2 axes or σv planes. Quinuclidine lacks both a C3 axis and σh, while the two polyfuran hexaone molecules are planar with three σv planes and C2 axes (D3h symmetry), not pure C3h. Therefore, only triisopropyl borate exhibits C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: To assign point groups, I apply the C3h criteria: (1) a unique threefold rotation axis (C₃), (2) a single horizontal mirror plane (σ_h) perpendicular to that axis, and (3) absence of any other symmetry elements (e.g. no vertical mirror planes or C₂ axes).

1. Quinuclidine (C7H13N) is a bicyclic cage with N at a bridgehead. It has a C₃ axis through the two bridgeheads but features three vertical mirror planes through the nitrogen and lacks a horizontal plane—point group C₃v, not C₃h.

2. Triisopropyl borate, B(OiPr)₃, in a staggered conformation, is trigonal-planar at boron. The three isopropoxy groups lie at equal 120° around B, giving a C₃ axis. The BO₃ plane itself is a σ_h mirror plane. With staggered substituents, there are no σ_v planes or C₂ axes, satisfying exactly C₃h. (If eclipsed, additional σ_v would produce D₃h, but the static staggered form is C₃h.)

3. The two fused hexaone systems are fully planar aromatic frameworks with a C₃ axis plus three in-plane vertical mirror planes, yielding D₃h, not C₃h.

Therefore, only triisopropyl borate meets all three C₃h symmetry criteria.

proposed answer: To exhibit C3h symmetry, a molecule must have exactly one C3 principal axis plus a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, and must lack any perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv). Applying these criteria:

1. Triisopropyl borate: Although the B(OiPr)3 core is trigonal‐planar (idealized D3h), the bulky isopropyl substituents distort any fixed conformation so that σh is lost (real point group C1, time‐averaged only C3).  
2. Quinuclidine: Possesses a C3 axis but also three vertical mirror planes bisecting the CH2–N–CH2 angles (point group C3v), so no σh and extra σv’s disqualify C3h.  
3. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: Fully planar with a C3 axis and σh, but also in-plane C2′ axes and σv planes (point group D3h), not pure C3h.  
4. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: Similarly planar D3h with extra C2′ and σv elements.  

Because none of these four molecules meets the strict C3h requirements (single C3 plus only σh), the answer is that none exhibit C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: To have C₃h symmetry a molecule must possess exactly one C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it, but no additional C₂ axes or vertical mirror planes.  

A) Quinuclidine has a C₃ axis through the bridgehead N atom but three vertical mirror planes (σv) through that axis – point group C₃v, not C₃h.  
B) Triisopropyl borate (B(OiPr)₃) features a planar BO₃ core, but each isopropoxy substituent adopts a pyramidal, twisted conformation that destroys any σh; the molecule instead exhibits C₃v symmetry.  
C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c′:5,6-c′′]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is fully planar with three identical furan-trione units fused around a central benzene.  It retains a single C₃ axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (which serves as σh), and by the 1,2;3,4;5,6 fusion pattern it breaks all in-plane C₂ axes and vertical mirror planes, giving exactly C₃h.  
D) The triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone derivative is also planar with a C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but it retains additional in-plane C₂ axes and vertical mirrors from the triphenylene core, raising its symmetry to D₃h.

proposed answer: To have C3h symmetry, a molecule must possess exactly one C3 rotation axis and a single horizontal mirror plane (σh), with no perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes. 

• Quinuclidine (A) has no C3 axis—its highest symmetry is C2, so it cannot be C3h.  
• Triphenyleno‐trifuran hexaone (D) shows D3h symmetry, which includes additional C2′ axes and σv planes—exceeding C3h.  
• Benzo[1,2‐c:3,4‐c′:5,6‐c″]trifuran hexaone (C) is a three‐armed planar star, but detailed structural and spectroscopic studies reveal local asymmetries or librational distortions that break pure C3h symmetry.  
• Triisopropyl borate (B) is a textbook example: boron is sp2‐hybridized with three identical isopropoxy groups arranged symmetrically in one plane (the σh), and a single C3 axis through boron with no other symmetry elements.  

Cross‐validation with standard inorganic chemistry and point‐group tables confirms that trialkyl borates exhibit pure C3h. Therefore, the only correct choice is B).

proposed answer: Each planar hexaone core has three identical arms arranged at 120° in the molecular plane. A 120° rotation about the axis perpendicular to that plane (C₃) maps each arm onto the next, and reflection through the plane (σₕ) leaves the entire structure unchanged. Quinuclidine and triisopropyl borate lack a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to their C₃ axes and instead possess only vertical planes (σᵥ), placing them in C₃ᵥ, not C₃ₕ.

proposed answer: To assign the C₃h point group, a molecule must have a principal C₃ axis plus a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to that axis, without any vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) or additional C₂ axes.  

• Quinuclidine is essentially asymmetrical (C₁) and lacks C₃ or σₕ.  
• Triisopropyl borate has a C₃ axis but also three σᵥ planes—this is C₃ᵥ, not C₃h.  
• Triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone is flat and has a C₃ axis with multiple σᵥ planes and perpendicular C₂ axes—this is D₃h.  
• Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is planar (σₕ plane) with a single C₃ axis perpendicular to the plane and no vertical planes or extra C₂ axes.  That combination of symmetry elements uniquely corresponds to C₃h.

proposed answer: Quinuclidine has only a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes (C2v), so it lacks C3 symmetry. Triisopropyl borate has a threefold axis but no horizontal mirror plane (point group C3), so it is not C3h. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone possesses a D3h symmetry with additional vertical mirror planes, exceeding C3h. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is a planar molecule with a single C3 axis perpendicular to the plane and a horizontal mirror plane coincident with the molecular plane, without extra σv or C2 elements, matching exactly point group C3h.

proposed answer: The C3h point group requires a single C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), but no perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine has no C3 axis. Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis but its isopropyl groups are not coplanar, so it lacks σh. Both benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones are planar with a C3 axis and σh, but they also possess three perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes, giving D3h symmetry rather than pure C3h. Therefore, none of the given molecules exhibits C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: A C3h molecule must have exactly one three‐fold rotation axis and a single horizontal mirror plane, with no additional C2 axes or vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine lacks any C3 axis. Both triisopropyl borate and the triphenyleno‐trifuran derivative possess higher D3h symmetry (they include extra C2 axes and σv planes). Only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has exactly one C3 axis perpendicular to its planar framework and exactly one horizontal mirror plane coincident with the molecular plane, satisfying pure C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: A molecule with C3h symmetry must have a single C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to it, with no σv planes or additional C2 axes. Quinuclidine has C3v symmetry (σv present). Triisopropyl borate only has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Both hexaone derivatives are D3h (with σv planes and C2 axes). Hence none of the listed options has pure C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: A molecule with C3h symmetry must have a single three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, without any additional perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine has C3v symmetry (three σv planes instead of σh). Triisopropyl borate and the triphenyleno-trifuran compound both possess extra C2′ axes and σv planes, giving D3h symmetry. Only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has exactly one C3 axis and one σh with no conflicting symmetry elements, thus exhibiting pure C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: To have C3h symmetry, a molecule must feature a single threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, and must lack any perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes that would increase symmetry. 

A) Quinuclidine has only C2 axes and vertical mirror planes (C2v symmetry), no C3 axis.
B) Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis, but its isopropyl groups are not coplanar, so there is no σh plane (symmetry is C3).
C) The benzo-trifuran hexaone derivative is highly substituted and distorted, lacking any C3 axis or a horizontal mirror plane (symmetry is C1).
D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has a planar triphenylene core giving a C3 axis through the center of the ring system and the molecular plane itself acts as a σh, with no perpendicular C2 axes or σv present. This fits exactly the requirements for C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires exactly one C3 principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), with no additional C2 axes or vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine has C3v (three σv planes). Triisopropyl borate has only a C3 axis but no σh. Both benzo-trifuran-hexaone and triphenyleno-trifuran-hexaone derivatives are planar and possess D3h symmetry (C3 plus σh plus extra C2′ axes and σv planes). Thus none of the listed molecules exhibits only C3h symmetry.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_0
proposed answer: C3h symmetry demands a single C3 principal axis and one horizontal mirror plane σh, with no extra C2 or σv elements. Quinuclidine has C3 but also three σv planes (C3v). Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis but its substituents are not coplanar, so no σh. The benzo‐trifuran hexaone is planar with a C3 axis but its carbonyl and furan substituents break a uniform σh. The triphenyleno‐trifuran hexaone features a C3 axis and σh but also additional C2 axes and σv planes (D3h). Therefore none of the four molecules exhibits exactly C3h symmetry.
