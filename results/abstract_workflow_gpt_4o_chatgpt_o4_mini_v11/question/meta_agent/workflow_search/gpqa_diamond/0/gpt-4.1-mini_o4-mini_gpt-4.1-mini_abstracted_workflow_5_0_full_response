Triisopropyl borate is built around a trigonal-planar boron center with three identical isopropoxy groups evenly spaced; it has a principal C3 axis but no horizontal mirror (propeller twist), so it is C3, not C3h.

Molecules in C3h must have three identical substituents evenly spaced at 120° around a central atom or core, and all atomic positions must lie either on or be reflected into each other by the horizontal mirror plane.

The presence of E, two C3 rotations, σh, and two S3 operations defines the group of order 6. In practice, a molecule in C3h must be planar with three identical substituents spaced at 120° around the axis, so that a 120° rotation or reflection through the molecular plane leaves it unchanged, and it must lack vertical mirrors or an inversion center.; answer: C3h symmetry requires a principal C3 axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it, giving group elements E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^−1; in practice a planar molecule with three identical 120°-spaced substituents and no vertical mirrors or inversion.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent DQVo, analyzing molecular structures for C3h symmetry, thinking: We apply the C3h criteria: a molecule must have a 3‐fold proper rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it.
