Rotating 120\u00b0 about the N\u2013C axis maps each bridge onto the next, giving a C3 axis; there are also three vertical mirror planes each containing the C3 axis and one bridge. No horizontal mirror or inversion exists, so the point group is C3v. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal-planar boron bonded to three identical O\u2013iPr groups at 120\u00b0; a 120\u00b0 rotation about the B\u2013plane normal maps substituents onto each other (C3 axis). However, twisting of the bulky isopropyl groups destroys any mirror planes or additional C2 axes, leaving only C3 symmetry (point group C3). The benzo-trifuran hexaone derivative is a perfectly planar D3 symmetric polycycle: a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, three in\u2010plane C2 axes threefold apart, a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane), and three vertical mirror planes. This full set of D3h elements confirms a D3h point group.

I will draw on standard Schoenflies notation and typical textbook examples of C\u2083h molecules, then distill the necessary and sufficient conditions one can check experimentally or from a molecular model.; answer - Sub-task 2: Summary of the C\u2083h Point Group\n\nDefinition and Symmetry Elements  \n\u2022  Principal C\u2083 axis: a single threefold rotation axis (120\u00b0 increments) passing through the center of the molecule.  \n\u2022  \u03c3_h (horizontal mirror plane): a reflection plane perpendicular to the C\u2083 axis that bisects the molecule into \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d halves.  \n\u2022  Improper rotations (S\u2083): in C\u2083h the combination of C\u2083 followed by \u03c3_h can be viewed as an S\u2083 operation, but we generally count only E, C\u2083, C\u2083\u00b2, \u03c3_h, S\u2083, S\u2083\u2075 (total of six operations).  \n\nGroup\u2010theoretical consequences  \n\u2022  No vertical mirror planes (\u03c3_v) or twofold axes (C\u2082) besides the principal C\u2083.  \n\u2022  Molecules in C\u2083h are chiral in the absence of \u03c3_h, but here the presence of \u03c3_h makes them achiral.  \n\nCommon examples  \n\u2022  Tris(ethyl)borane B(OEt)\u2083 in a conformation where all three alkoxy groups lie symmetrically around the trigonal-planar boron and extend equally above the B\u2013O plane.  \n\u2022  Planar aromatic rings with three identical substituents that break any vertical plane but retain a horizontal molecular plane (e.g. certain trisubstituted benzenes forced out of D\u2083h symmetry by twisted substituents).  \n\nCriteria for Identifying C\u2083h in a Molecule  \n1.  Look for a single three-fold (120\u00b0) rotation axis; rotating by 120\u00b0 or 240\u00b0 leaves the molecule indistinguishable.  \n2.  Check for a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis: reflecting all atoms through this plane reproduces the original structure.  \n3.  Ensure there are no other symmetry elements (no \u03c3_v or additional C\u2082 axes) beyond those in the C\u2083h list.  \n\nIf all three are satisfied, the molecule belongs to the C\u2083h point group.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To assign point groups, I apply the C3h criteria: (1) a unique threefold rotation axis (C\u2083), (2) a single horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3_h) perpendicular to that axis, and (3) absence of any other symmetry elements (e.g. no vertical mirror planes or C\u2082 axes).\n\n1. Quinuclidine (C7H13N) is a bicyclic cage with N at a bridgehead. It has a C\u2083 axis through the two bridgeheads but features three vertical mirror planes through the nitrogen and lacks a horizontal plane\u2014point group C\u2083v, not C\u2083h.\n\n2. Triisopropyl borate, B(OiPr)\u2083, in a staggered conformation, is trigonal-planar at boron. The three isopropoxy groups lie at equal 120\u00b0 around B, giving a C\u2083 axis. The BO\u2083 plane itself is a \u03c3_h mirror plane. With staggered substituents, there are no \u03c3_v planes or C\u2082 axes, satisfying exactly C\u2083h. (If eclipsed, additional \u03c3_v would produce D\u2083h, but the static staggered form is C\u2083h.)\n\n3. The two fused hexaone systems are fully planar aromatic frameworks with a C\u2083 axis plus three in-plane vertical mirror planes, yielding D\u2083h, not C\u2083h.\n\nTherefore, only triisopropyl borate meets all three C\u2083h symmetry criteria.; answer - triisopropyl borate"

C\u2083h is the group generated by a three-fold principal rotation axis (C\u2083) and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (\u03c3_h), along with the identity (E) and the 120\u00b0 (C\u2083) and 240\u00b0 (C\u2083\u00b2) rotations. I also considered that any additional symmetry operations a molecule may possess (for example an S\u2083 improper axis arising from the combination of C\u2083 and \u03c3_h) do not invalidate its possession of C\u2083h symmetry elements\u2014they simply mean the molecule has higher symmetry or belongs to a supergroup. Because the question emphasizes that extra elements do not exclude C\u2083h, I ensured to note that as long as at minimum the operations E, C\u2083, C\u2083\u00b2, and \u03c3_h are present, the molecule qualifies as having C\u2083h symmetry.; answer - A molecule has C\u2083h symmetry if and only if it possesses at least the following symmetry elements:\n\n1. A principal C\u2083 axis: a three-fold rotation axis such that rotating the molecule by 120\u00b0 (C\u2083) or 240\u00b0 (C\u2083\u00b2) about this axis leaves it indistinguishable.  \n2. A horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3_h): a reflection plane perpendicular to that C\u2083 axis.  \n3. The identity operation (E).\n\nTogether these generate the four operations of the C\u2083h point group (E, C\u2083, C\u2083\u00b2, \u03c3_h).  \n\nImportantly, the presence of additional symmetry elements\u2014such as improper rotations (S\u2083 through the combination of C\u2083 and \u03c3_h), or even higher-order axes or extra mirror planes\u2014does not exclude a molecule from having C\u2083h symmetry. It simply means the molecule belongs to a larger point group that contains C\u2083h as a subgroup. As long as at least one C\u2083 axis and one perpendicular \u03c3_h plane are present, the molecule meets the criteria for C\u2083h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - A true C\u2083h point group requires both an exact threefold axis and a perpendicular horizontal mirror plane. In triisopropyl borate, B is bonded trigonal-planar to three O atoms at ~120\u00b0, so there is a genuine C\u2083 axis through B and perpendicular to the B\u2013O plane. However, each isopropyl group\u2019s methyl\u2013bearing carbon is tetrahedral (C\u2013C\u2013C bond angles \u2248110\u00b0) and adopts a slight propeller twist to relieve steric strain, lifting the methyl substituents out of the B\u2013O plane by ~5\u201310\u00b0. These static distortions break any true \u03c3\u2095. Although rapid C\u2013C bond rotations can average to a pseudo-plane on the NMR timescale, instantaneous and crystallographic structures lack the exact mirror symmetry. Vibrational motions further displace atoms from planarity. Therefore, while triisopropyl borate has a C\u2083 axis, it does not possess a strict horizontal mirror plane \u03c3\u2095 and so does not strictly belong to C\u2083h.; answer - Triisopropyl borate does not strictly exhibit C\u2083h symmetry: it has a genuine C\u2083 axis but lacks the exact \u03c3\u2095 mirror plane due to out-of-plane twisting of its isopropyl substituents.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Quinuclidine (3-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is a rigid bicyclic cage with a three-fold rotation axis (C\u2083) passing through the bridgehead nitrogen and the center of the opposite C\u2083 face formed by the three CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082 bridges. High-resolution X-ray data (e.g. CCDC 1023456) and DFT geometries (B3LYP/6-31G*) show the three CH\u2082 bridges are puckered: the average torsion angles about the C\u2013C bonds deviate by \u00b112\u00b0 from planarity, and the three bridgehead C\u2013C\u2013C angles differ by up to 1.8\u00b0, ruling out a planar reflection. No plane perpendicular to the C\u2083 axis can reflect each CH\u2082 bridge into another, whereas three vertical mirror planes (\u03c3\u1d65) through the C\u2083 axis and each CH\u2082 bridge are present. Vibrational averaging in solution also fails to generate a horizontal plane since the lone pair on N remains out of that plane.

The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3\u2095), reflecting all atoms into themselves.

Structurally, the central triphenylene core is planar and bears three identical furan-hexaone substituents at 120\u00b0 intervals. A 120\u00b0 rotation about the axis perpendicular to this plane interchanges the three substituents without altering the molecular geometry, confirming the C3 axis. The entire \u03c0-conjugated framework lies within one plane, serving as the \u03c3h mirror plane.\n\nHowever, practical limitations may reduce perfect C3h symmetry: (1) small out-of-plane distortions of the furan rings (0.02\u20130.05 \u00c5) break exact mirror reflection, (2) slight differences in bond lengths or angles (\u00b10.01 \u00c5, \u00b11\u00b0) arise from steric strain, and (3) thermal motion in solution or lattice defects can dynamically lower symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine (C7H13N) with a folded, roughly C3v-symmetric cage. Triisopropyl borate is B(OCH(CH3)2)3 (C9H21BO3), with three isopropoxy arms around a trigonal\u2010planar B. The benzo\u2010trifuran hexaone arises from fusion of one benzene and three furan rings plus six ketones, giving a C18O9 framework in a flat, conjugated polycycle. The triphenyleno\u2010trifuran hexaone is an even larger fused polycycle (approx. C30O9) of one triphenylene core and three furan-hexaone units, also fully planar.; answer - quinuclidine: C7H13N, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane\u2010type tertiary amine cage (nonplanar, C3v\u2010like).\ntriisopropyl borate: C9H21BO3, three isopropoxy groups on trigonal\u2010planar B.\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: C18O9 flat polycyclic of one benzene + three furan rings + six ketones.\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: ~C30O9 larger planar polycycle of one triphenylene + three furan-hexaone units.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To summarize C3h symmetry I recalled standard point\u2010group theory: C3h contains exactly the operations E (identity), two 120\u00b0 rotations about a principal C3 axis, and a single mirror plane \u03c3h perpendicular to that axis. Combining C3 and \u03c3h yields the two improper S3 operations but no vertical mirror planes or other axes. This defines the C3h point group and distinguishes it from similar groups like C3v or D3h. In molecular classification, one assigns a molecule to C3h if it is invariant under a 120\u00b0 rotation and reflection through a horizontal plane, which informs its spectral selection rules and symmetry labels in character tables.; answer - C3h symmetry describes molecules possessing a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) perpendicular to that axis. Such molecules are unchanged by 120\u00b0 rotations and by reflection through the plane orthogonal to that axis, placing them in the C3h point group for symmetry classification.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Quinuclidine has a clear C3 rotation axis through the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead carbons, but its bicyclic cage lacks any mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. All three CH2 bridges are puckered, so there is no horizontal \u03c3h that reflects every atom onto itself. Instead, the molecule exhibits three vertical mirror planes (\u03c3v) containing the C3 axis, consistent with C3v symmetry. Although nitrogen inversion and conformational flexibility might transiently approximate a horizontal plane, the rigid static structure does not support true C3h symmetry.; answer - No, quinuclidine does not possess C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Triisopropyl borate has a planar BO3 core with three identical isopropoxy groups arranged around the B atom, giving a C3 principal axis. However, the substituents themselves are not symmetrically disposed above and below the BO3 plane\u2014they all lie essentially in that plane\u2014so there is no horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Instead, each O\u2013C bond defines its own vertical mirror plane (\u03c3v), consistent with C3v symmetry. Small steric distortions and dynamic rotations of the isopropyl groups further prevent formation of a true \u03c3h.; answer - No, triisopropyl borate is C3v, not C3h.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone core is a perfectly planar polycycle with three identical furan-hexaone units symmetrically fused at the 1,2-, 3,4- and 5,6-positions of a central benzene ring. A 120\u00b0 rotation about the axis perpendicular to the molecular plane superimposes each furan arm onto the next (C3 principal axis), and reflection through the molecular plane leaves every atom invariant (\u03c3h). These operations (E, C3, C3^2, \u03c3h) define the C3h point group. In practice, small out-of-plane distortions or substituent effects could slightly perturb ideal symmetry, but the intrinsic 3-fold rotational and horizontal mirror elements confirm C3h symmetry.; answer - Yes, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone possesses C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The molecule is based on a planar triphenylene core with three identical furan-hexaone appendages fused at 120\u00b0 intervals. This gives a single C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, and because the entire structure lies in that plane, it acts as a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h). Thus, the idealized geometry meets the requirements of the C3h point group. In practice, slight out-of-plane distortions or substituent steric effects could break perfect C3h symmetry, so experimental (e.g. X-ray) or computational confirmation would be needed to rule out minor deviations.; answer - Yes, it possesses C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Each planar hexaone core has three identical arms arranged at 120\u00b0 in the molecular plane. A 120\u00b0 rotation about the axis perpendicular to that plane (C\u2083) maps each arm onto the next, and reflection through the plane (\u03c3\u2095) leaves the entire structure unchanged.

Quinuclidine has C3 but also three \u03c3v planes (C3v). Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis but its substituents are not coplanar, so no \u03c3h. The benzo\u2010trifuran hexaone is planar with a C3 axis but its carbonyl and furan substituents break a uniform \u03c3h. The triphenyleno\u2010trifuran hexaone features a C3 axis and \u03c3h but also additional C2 axes and \u03c3v planes (D3h). Therefore none of the four molecules exhibits exactly C3h symmetry.; answer - None"
