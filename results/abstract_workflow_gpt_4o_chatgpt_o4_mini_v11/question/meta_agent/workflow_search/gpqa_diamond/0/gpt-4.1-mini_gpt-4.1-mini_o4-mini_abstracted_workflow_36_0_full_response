Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a rigid structure but does not have C3h symmetry; it is more likely to have C1 or Cs symmetry. Triisopropyl borate, with three isopropyl groups attached to boron, is a good candidate for C3h symmetry because the three substituents can be arranged symmetrically around the boron atom, and the molecule can have a horizontal mirror plane.

To confirm C3h symmetry, the molecule must be invariant under a 120-degree rotation about the C3 axis and reflection through the horizontal mirror plane. From the 3D structural data obtained in Sub-task 1, triisopropyl borate has three isopropyl groups symmetrically arranged around the central boron atom. This arrangement allows a 120-degree rotation about the axis passing through boron and the center of the three substituents, mapping each isopropyl group onto the next. Additionally, the molecule possesses a horizontal mirror plane that bisects the boron atom and is perpendicular to the C3 axis, reflecting the isopropyl groups onto themselves.
