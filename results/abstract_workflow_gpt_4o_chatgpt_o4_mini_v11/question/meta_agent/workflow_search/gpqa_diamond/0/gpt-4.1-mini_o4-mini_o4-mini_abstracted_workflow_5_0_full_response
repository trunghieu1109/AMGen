The benzo-trifuran hexaone core is planar with a C₃ axis and one horizontal mirror plane, but lacks the three σᵥ planes required for D₃h and has no S₃ improper axes, giving only C₃ (no σᵥ), not C₃h.

Benzo-trifuran hexaone: planar tricyclic core has a C3 axis, but the arrangement of furan rings and carbonyl oxygens does not give a uniform σh plane → not C3h. Triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone: planar macrocycle has C3 and a horizontal mirror plane, but also possesses additional C2 axes and vertical σv planes (point group D3h), so it exceeds the symmetry of C3h → not C3h.

Minor out-of-plane distortions can also break an ideal σh.
