proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a molecule to have a principal C3 rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis due to its three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around boron, but it lacks the horizontal mirror plane because the isopropyl groups are not planar. Quinuclidine, with its bicyclic cage structure, lacks both the C3 axis and the horizontal mirror plane. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is a complex fused ring system unlikely to have C3h symmetry due to the absence of the required symmetry elements. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has a planar triphenylene core with symmetric substituents, providing both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, thus possessing C3h symmetry. Therefore, only triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a molecule to have a threefold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) perpendicular to this axis. Among the given molecules, triisopropyl borate has a boron atom bonded symmetrically to three isopropyl groups arranged around it, which provides a C3 axis. Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis, fulfilling the criteria for C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine, being a bicyclic amine, lacks a threefold rotational axis and thus does not have C3h symmetry. The complex fused polycyclic aromatic compounds benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone have complicated structures that generally do not support simple symmetry elements like C3h. This conclusion is supported by molecular symmetry principles and literature on borate esters, which confirm the presence of C3h symmetry in triisopropyl borate. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule with C3h symmetry.
