This gives a single C3 axis through B perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, each isopropyl substituent is an sp3 carbon bearing two CH3 groups and one H, so there is no overall mirror plane (σh) through the BO3 plane: reflecting would swap nonidentical substituents.

There is no mirror plane perpendicular to this axis (because it would swap N with C), but there are three vertical planes (σv) each containing the N–C axis and bisecting one bridge while interchanging the other two equivalent bridges.

It has a C₃ principal axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane itself).

However, the analysis overlooks thermal and conformational flexibility of isopropyl substituents (which may break perfect C3 symmetry), potential minor deviations from planarity, and limitations of the computational model (e.g. basis set, optimization tolerances) that can slightly distort symmetry elements.; correct: Assignments are sound but subject to conformational and computational limitations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent cXsv, refined thinking: Analysis of the optimized 3D geometries against the C3h criteria (a single C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane σh perpendicular to it, and no perpendicular C2 axes) confirms the following: 1.
