Sources like the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), PubChem, or computational tools like Gaussian or Avogadro can be utilized to obtain these geometries. The geometries should be in standardized file formats such as .mol, .pdb, or .sdf for compatibility with various molecular visualization and simulation software.; answer - Acquire or generate high-quality 3D geometries for triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c:5,6-c]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c:9,10-c]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone from authoritative sources and output standardized file formats.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To reorient each molecule so that the principal C3 axis candidates align with the laboratory z-axis, one would typically apply a rotation transformation to the molecular coordinates. This involves identifying the C3 axis of symmetry for each molecule and determining the necessary rotation angles to align this axis with the z-axis of the laboratory coordinate system. The transformation matrices that result from these rotations can then be recorded. Software such as molecular modeling programs can assist in performing these rotations and obtaining the new coordinates.; answer - Reorient each molecule so that principal C3 axis candidates align with laboratory z-axis; output rotated coordinates and record transformation matrices.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To apply an automated symmetry-detection algorithm on the reoriented coordinates, one would typically use computational tools that analyze the molecular geometry to identify symmetry elements such as axes of rotation, mirror planes, and inversion centers. The algorithm would process the coordinates of the reoriented molecules and generate a table that lists these symmetry elements along with their geometric definitions, which describe the nature and orientation of each symmetry element in relation to the molecular structure.

This involves calculating the new coordinates after rotation and comparing them to the original coordinates. If the atoms align closely enough (within the defined tolerance), the test passes; otherwise, it fails. The deviation metrics would quantify how closely the atoms align after rotation. This process is crucial for confirming the presence of C3 symmetry in the molecular structure.; answer - Test for C3 rotation about the z-axis by rotating structures by \u00b1120\u00b0 and verifying atomic overlay within tolerance; record pass/fail and deviation metrics.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To test for the presence of a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the z-axis, one would reflect the molecular coordinates across the xy-plane. After performing this reflection, the new coordinates should be compared to the original coordinates to check for positional equivalence within a specified tolerance. If the reflected coordinates match the original coordinates within this tolerance, it indicates the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. The results would be recorded as pass or fail, along with any deviation metrics that quantify how closely the reflected coordinates match the original ones. This process is essential for confirming symmetry properties of the molecule.; answer - Test for presence of a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to z-axis by reflecting across xy-plane and checking positional equivalence within tolerance; record pass/fail and deviation metrics.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To compile results from subtask 4 and 5 into a summary table, we need to create a JSON object that lists each molecule along with boolean flags indicating whether they possess C3 symmetry (from subtask 4) and a horizontal mirror plane (from subtask 5).
