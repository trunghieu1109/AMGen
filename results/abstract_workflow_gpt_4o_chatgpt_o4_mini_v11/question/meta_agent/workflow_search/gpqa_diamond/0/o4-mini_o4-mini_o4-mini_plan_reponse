There is no mirror plane perpendicular to this axis (because it would swap N with C), but there are three vertical planes (\u03c3v) each containing the N\u2013C axis and bisecting one bridge while interchanging the other two equivalent bridges.

It has a C\u2083 principal axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane itself). In addition, because each pair of furan units can be interchanged by a 180\u00b0 rotation about axes lying in the plane (three C\u2082 axes), the full symmetry is D\u2083h rather than C\u2083h.; answer - D3h\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The molecule triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c:9,10-c]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is a planar macrocyclic system composed of three identical phenylene\u2013furan\u2013hexaone segments arranged symmetrically around a central axis.
