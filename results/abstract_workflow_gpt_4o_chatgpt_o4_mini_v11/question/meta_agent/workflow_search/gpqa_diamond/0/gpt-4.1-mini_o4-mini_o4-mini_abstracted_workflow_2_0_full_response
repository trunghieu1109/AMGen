From Sub-task 2 point groups: quinuclidine and triisopropyl borate are C3v (they have three σv but no σh). The two hexaone-fused aromatics are D3h (they have σh but also three C2 axes and three σv). None of these is the pure C3h point group.

Quinuclidine is C₃v (it has three vertical mirror planes but no σₕ), triisopropyl borate is actually D₃h (it has a C₃ axis, a horizontal mirror plane, plus three C₂ axes and three σᵥ), and the two hexaone-fused aromatics are D₃h (they also have extra C₂ axes and vertical planes). Since C₃h requires only a C₃ axis and a single horizontal plane with no additional symmetry, none of the molecules qualifies.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Analyze the point group symmetries from Sub-task 2 to identify molecules exhibiting C3 symmetry elements and select which molecule(s) have C3h symmetry.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks="Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To identify symmetry elements, we must know each molecule’s shape and atom connectivity.
