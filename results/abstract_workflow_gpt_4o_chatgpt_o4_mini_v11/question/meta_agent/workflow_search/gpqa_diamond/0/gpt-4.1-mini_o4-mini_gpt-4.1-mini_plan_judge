Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_0
proposed answer: From the point‐group assignments in Sub‐task 2: 
- Triisopropyl borate has only a C₃ axis (point group C₃). 
- Quinuclidine has a C₃ axis, perpendicular C₂ axes and σₕ planes (point group D₃h). 
- The benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is planar with a threefold rotation axis and only the molecular plane as a mirror (E, C₃ and σₕ), matching C₃h. 
- The triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has additional C₂ axes and σᵥ planes (point group D₃h). 
Thus the only molecule exhibiting C₃h symmetry is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (choice C).

proposed answer: Among the four candidates, only triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone possesses both a proper C₃ rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) coincident with that plane. The C₃ axis gives threefold symmetry at 120° increments, while the planar nature of the fused rings provides a σₕ that reflects the molecule onto itself. Triisopropyl borate, though having C₃ symmetry, lacks σₕ (it is C₃v). Quinuclidine and the benzo-trifuran hexaone lack any C₃ axis (C₁ point group). Therefore, the only molecule exhibiting C₃h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

proposed answer: To exhibit C₃h symmetry a molecule must have a principal three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to that axis. From the symmetry analysis:

• Triisopropyl borate has only a C₃ axis (no σₕ) → C₃, not C₃h.
• Quinuclidine lacks both C₃ and σₕ → C₁.
• Both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone are perfectly planar with three identical arms at 120°, giving a C₃ axis perpendicular to the plane and the molecular plane itself acting as σₕ. Their full point group is D₃h, which inherently includes the C₃h subgroup.

Answer:The molecules that exhibit C₃h symmetry are:

• benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
• triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

Each is planar with a C₃ axis through the center and a horizontal mirror plane in the molecular plane, satisfying the criteria for C₃h symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a principal C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. Triisopropyl borate has an sp2‐hybridized boron center with three identical isopropoxy groups arranged in a planar trigonal geometry. A 120° rotation about the B–O axis leaves the molecule unchanged (C3), and the plane of the substituent oxygens serves as the σh mirror plane. Quinuclidine lacks any C3 axis due to its bicyclic, non‐planar structure. The benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones, although roughly planar, do not possess three identical substituents nor a horizontal mirror plane because their fused-ring substituents break the required symmetry. Hence, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule exhibiting C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a principal C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. Among the four candidates, only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is a flat, threefold symmetric molecule whose molecular plane serves as σh while the perpendicular C3 axis rotates the three furanyl arms into each other. The others either lack an exact σh (triisopropyl borate’s isopropyl groups are twisted; triphenyleno-trifuran's peripheral rings are out of plane) or a C3 axis (quinuclidine). Therefore, choice C exhibits C3h symmetry.
