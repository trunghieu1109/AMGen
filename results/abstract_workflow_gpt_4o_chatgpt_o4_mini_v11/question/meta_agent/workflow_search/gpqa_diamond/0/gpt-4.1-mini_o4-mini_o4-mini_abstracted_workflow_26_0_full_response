From Sub-task 2: quinuclidine is C3v (has σv’s, not σh), both benzo-trifuran and triphenyleno-trifuran systems are D3h (they have C2’s and σv’s in addition to σh), while triisopropyl borate has precisely E, C3/C3^2, and σh (and improper S3 axes but no σv or C2), matching C3h exactly.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Vr9h:\nWe need molecules that have exactly C3h symmetry: a principal C3 axis plus a horizontal mirror plane, but no vertical mirror planes or perpendicular C2 axes. From sub‐task 2: Quinuclidine is C3v (it has three σv planes), so not C3h. The two fused polycycles are D3h (they have three C2⊥ axes and σv’s), so not C3h.

Quinuclidine is a rigid bicyclic cage with identical ethylene bridges to N and an N–H along the axis, giving a C3 axis plus three vertical mirror planes but no horizontal plane or perpendicular C2s.  Tri-isopropyl borate is trigonal around B, but the bulky iPr groups twist freely, retaining only the principal C3 rotations; no planes or improper axes survive.  The benzo-trifuran hexaone is perfectly planar with three identical furan-dione wings on a benzene core, yielding D3h (E, C3, 3 C2⊥, σh, 3 σv).  The triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone is also three-fold branched but steric repulsion forces the furan diones slightly out of plane in a propeller fashion, destroying any σv while preserving E, C3, and σh (the plane of the triphenylene core), i.e. C3h.; answer: Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):\n  • Structure: Rigid bicyclic cage with N at one apex, three identical –(CH2)2– bridges to a basal C3 triangle, N bears H along the axis.\n  • Symmetry elements: E; C3 axis through N–H to triangle center; three vertical mirror planes through C3 and each bridge.  Point group C3v.\n\nTriisopropyl borate (B(O^iPr)_3):\n  • Structure: Trigonal planar BO3 core, each O–iPr substituent can freely rotate and is asymmetric.\n  • Symmetry elements: E; C3 axis through B and the centroid of the three O atoms.

Each isopropyl has an internal mirror plane (bisecting its two methyls) that can be aligned through B–O–C. All three such planes coincide at the B center and contain the threefold axis. There is a single C3 axis through B and perpendicular to that plane of the oxygens, and three vertical σv planes; no horizontal σh exists because the substituents extend both above and below the B–O plane without full reflection symmetry. This is point group C3v. 2) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane): features a threefold axis through the bridgehead N and opposite C3 face, and three equivalent planes each slicing through that C3 axis and bisecting opposite C–C bridges (σv’s). No σh, no perpendicular C2’s. Thus C3v. 3) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: the entire polycyclic π system is planar with threefold symmetry.
