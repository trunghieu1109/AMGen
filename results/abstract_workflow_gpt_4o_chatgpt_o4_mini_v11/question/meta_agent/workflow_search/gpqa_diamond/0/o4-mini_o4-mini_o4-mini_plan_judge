proposed answer: Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar BO₃ core substituted by three identical isopropyl groups. The only symmetry elements present are a single C₃ rotation axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and a mirror plane (σ_h) coincident with the molecular plane. There are no additional C₂ axes or vertical mirror planes that would elevate its symmetry to D₃h. Quinuclidine lacks any C₃ axis, and the fused hexaone aromatics possess additional C₂ axes and σ_v planes, resulting in D₃h rather than C₃h symmetry. Therefore the only molecule exhibiting pure C₃h symmetry is triisopropyl borate.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a single C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, without vertical mirrors or perpendicular C2 axes. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is planar, has exactly a threefold rotational axis, and a horizontal mirror plane but no perpendicular C2 axes or σv planes, matching C3h.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_0
proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a principal threefold axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) with no vertical mirror planes (σv). Quinuclidine is C3v (σv planes present), triisopropyl borate is C3 (no σh), and the triphenyleno–trifuran hexaone is D3h (σv present). Only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is planar with a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane (serving as σh) and lacks σv, giving it C3h symmetry.
