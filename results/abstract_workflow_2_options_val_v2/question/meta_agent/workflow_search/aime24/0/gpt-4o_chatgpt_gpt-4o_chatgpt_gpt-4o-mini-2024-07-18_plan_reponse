        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",
        "correct_answer": "204",
        "n": "abstract_workflow_1_0",
        "response": "In sub-task 4, the time calculated was 154 minutes, which was intended to include both the walking time and the coffee shop time. The confusion arose from whether this time was meant to be the total time or just the walking time. However, the original calculation in sub-task 4 was meant to include the coffee shop time, as it was stated that the total time was 154 minutes, including the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop. Therefore, the total time is already 154 minutes, and there is no need to add the coffee shop time again. The feedback suggesting that the walking time was 154 minutes and that the coffee shop time should be added was based on a misunderstanding of the original intent of sub-task 4. The 154 minutes is the total time, including the coffee shop time.\n\nAnswer:154",

        "response": "In Sub-task 5, the total time for Aya's walk, including the time spent in the coffee shop, was calculated as 214 minutes. This value represents the total time in minutes, which is the format requested in Sub-task 6. Therefore, no further conversion is necessary since the answer is already in the desired format of just minutes. The task was simply to ensure the time was expressed only in minutes, which it already was.\n\nAnswer:214",
