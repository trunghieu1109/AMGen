Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Analyze the expression n^4 + 1 and its divisibility by p^2. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9LXe:
To analyze the expression n^4 + 1 and its divisibility by p^2, we need to consider the conditions under which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. For a prime p, if n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, then n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). This implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For this congruence to hold, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We start by considering the congruence modulo p. If n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), then n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p), meaning the order of n modulo p must divide 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, or 8. If the order is 8, then n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is possible. However, for divisibility by p^2, we need a stronger condition. We use Hensel&#39;s lemma to lift solutions from modulo p to modulo p^2. If n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), we need to check if this can be lifted to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This requires that the derivative 4n^3 is not congruent to 0 modulo p, ensuring that the solution can be lifted. Therefore, we need to find the smallest prime p such that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2, which involves checking small primes and their properties regarding fourth power residues.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9LXe:
To analyze n^4 + 1 and its divisibility by p^2, we consider n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This requires -1 to be a fourth power residue modulo p^2, and we use Hensel&#39;s lemma to lift solutions from modulo p to modulo p^2.

### Sub-task 2: Determine the conditions under which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 for a prime p. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KQdH:
For n^4 + 1 to be divisible by p^2, we need n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means that -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We start by checking modulo p. If n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), then n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p), and the order of n modulo p must divide 8. The possible orders that allow n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) are 4 or 8. If the order is 4, then n^2 ≡ 1 (mod p), which doesn&#39;t help. If the order is 8, then n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is possible. We then need to check if this solution can be lifted to modulo p^2 using Hensel&#39;s lemma. Hensel&#39;s lemma states that if f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p) has a solution and the derivative f&#39;(x) is not 0 modulo p, then the solution can be lifted to modulo p^2. Here, f(x) = x^4 + 1, so f&#39;(x) = 4x^3. For n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), we need n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) and 4n^3 ≢ 0 (mod p), meaning p does not divide n, ensuring the solution can be lifted. Therefore, the conditions are: n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p), and 4n^3 ≢ 0 (mod p).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent KQdH:
For n^4 + 1 to be divisible by p^2, n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) must hold. This requires: 1) n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), 2) n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p), and 3) 4n^3 ≢ 0 (mod p) to ensure the solution can be lifted from modulo p to modulo p^2 using Hensel&#39;s lemma.

### Sub-task 3: Identify the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent H4ZC:
To identify the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we need to find the smallest prime p such that there exists an n with n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We start by considering small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 is 0 or 1 modulo 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing n = 1, 2, ..., 8, we find no solution. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Testing n = 1, 2, ..., 24, we find that n = 3 works since 3^4 = 81 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Therefore, the least prime p is 5.

### Sub-task 4: Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by the identified p^2. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent AEx1:
The least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 5. Therefore, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 (since p^2 = 25). This means we need m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). From the previous analysis, we found that for p = 5, n = 3 works because 3^4 = 81 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Therefore, m = 3 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. This is confirmed by checking that 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent AEx1:

### Sub-task 5: Integrate outputs from all previous subtasks to generate the final answer for the least positive integer m. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9WQA (yourself):
From the previous sub-tasks, we determined that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 5. This was found by checking small primes and verifying that for p = 5, n = 3 satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Therefore, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. Since we already found that n = 3 works for p = 5, we have m = 3 as the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. This is confirmed by the calculation 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25. Thus, the least positive integer m is 3.
