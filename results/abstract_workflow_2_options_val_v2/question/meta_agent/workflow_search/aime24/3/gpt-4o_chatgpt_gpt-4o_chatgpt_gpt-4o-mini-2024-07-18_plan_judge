Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To find the number of intersections of the graphs, we need to determine when the expressions 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are equal. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1/2, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| maps this to a value between 0 and 1/4. Therefore, g(f(x)) maps any input to a value between 0 and 1/4, and multiplying by 4 scales this to between 0 and 1. The key is to find when g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively, we consider the interval [0, 1] for x and y. The function f(x) is symmetric around 1/2, and g(x) is symmetric around 1/4. The values of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) that result in the same output after applying f and g are those that are symmetric around these points. By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry, we find that there are 8 such pairs (x, y) within the interval [0, 1] that satisfy the condition. The periodicity of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) ensures that there are multiple such points within the range [0, 1]. Therefore, there are 8 intersections. The reasoning is based on the symmetry and periodicity of the functions involved, which lead to multiple points of intersection within the given interval.

proposed answer: To calculate the number of intersection points, we analyze the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) with the constraint y = x. Both functions g and f have a period of 1, and since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with period 1, the compositions g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are also periodic with period 1. The symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, combined with the periodicity of f and g, implies that the graphs intersect at symmetric points within one period. The constraint y = x means the intersections are restricted to the line y = x. In one period [0, 1], the functions intersect at distinct symmetric points. Given the structure of f and g, intersections occur when the expressions inside the absolute values equate. The periodicity and symmetry typically lead to double the expected intersections due to symmetry across both the x and y axes. Hence, within the unit interval [0, 1], there are 8 intersection points, considering the doubling effect due to symmetry.
