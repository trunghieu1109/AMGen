Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_155
proposed answer: Based on the analyses from the sub-tasks, the standard (achiral) HPLC resolves the mixture into 2 peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomers. The chiral HPLC resolves the mixture into 3 peaks: one for each enantiomer and one for the meso compound. Comparing these results to the multiple-choice options, '2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC' corresponds to choice 3. Therefore, choice 3 accurately describes the chromatographic behavior of the mixture on both columns.
