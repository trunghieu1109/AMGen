These contributions are generally proportional to the fourth power of the masses of the particles in the loops, as these are the terms that appear in the effective potential after integrating out the heavy fields. Each contribution typically has a specific sign depending on the nature of the particle: bosonic loops (including scalar and gauge bosons) generally contribute positively to the mass squared, while fermionic loops contribute negatively due to their statistics. In this model, the contributions come from the scalar bosons (H_1, H^±, H^0, A^0), gauge bosons (W, Z), the top quark (t), and singlet fermions (N_i). The general formula for the one-loop correction can be written as a sum of these contributions, each scaled by their respective coupling constants (typically denoted as \\alpha_i).

Each particle contributes a term proportional to its mass to the fourth power, reflecting the loop corrections. The contributions from scalar bosons (H_1, H^±, H^0, A^0), gauge bosons (W, Z), the top quark (t), and singlet fermions (N_i) are considered. The sign of each contribution depends on the nature of the particle: scalar contributions are generally positive, while fermionic contributions are negative due to the statistics of particles. The denominator (x^2 + v^2) arises from the VEVs of the scalar fields, reflecting the scale of symmetry breaking. The formula is generally expressed as M_{h_2}^2 = (1/8π^2(x^2 + v^2)) * {Σ α_i M_i^4}, where α_i are coefficients reflecting the strength of each contribution.

These corrections are typically derived using the Coleman-Weinberg potential or similar methods, which take into account loop diagrams involving other fields. The general formula for the one-loop correction to the mass squared, M_{h_2}^2, of the pseudo-Goldstone boson is given by summing the contributions from all relevant particles. Each contribution is proportional to the fourth power of the mass of the particle running in the loop and inversely proportional to the square of the combined VEV factor (x^2 + v^2). The sign of each contribution depends on the nature of the particle: typically, contributions from bosons (scalar and gauge) are positive, while contributions from fermions are negative due to their statistics. Specifically, the relevant particles are the scalar bosons (H_1, H^±, H^0, A^0), gauge bosons (W, Z), the top quark (t), and singlet fermions (N_i). The formula is structured as a sum of terms, each involving a coupling constant (α_i) and the fourth power of the mass of the particle (M_i^4), divided by the combined VEV squared. The role of the combined VEV factor is to ensure the correct dimensionality and to reflect the scale of symmetry breaking. The contributions from the scalar bosons and gauge bosons are positive, while the contributions from the top quark and singlet fermions are negative. This is consistent with the general behavior of radiative corrections in quantum field theory, where fermionic loops tend to lower the mass while bosonic loops increase it. The validation step involves checking that all relevant particles are included and that their contributions have the correct sign and dependence on the VEV factor.; answer: M_{h_2}^2=\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2(x^2+v^2)}\\left\\{\\alpha_1M_{h_1}^4+\\alpha_2M_W^4+\\alpha_3M_Z^4-\\alpha_4M_t^4+\\alpha_5M_{H^\\pm}^4+\\alpha_6M_{H^0}^4+\\alpha_7M_{A^0}^4-\\alpha_8\\sum M_{N_i}^4\\right\\}\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, validating formula completeness, thinking: The derived formula for the radiative correction to the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 is consistent across the responses from the debate agents.
