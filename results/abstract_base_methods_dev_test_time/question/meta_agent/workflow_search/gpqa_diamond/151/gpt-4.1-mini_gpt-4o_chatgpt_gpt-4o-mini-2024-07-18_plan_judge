Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: The pre-replication complex is primarily involved in the initiation of DNA replication, not in transcriptional activation. During the formation of the shmoo in yeast, which is a response to mating signals, transcriptional activation is the key process. This involves the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex, which are directly associated with transcription. The nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin and can be present in both active and inactive chromatin, but it is not specifically linked to transcriptional activation. Since the pre-replication complex is not involved in transcription and is instead related to DNA replication, it is the least likely to be observed in a chromatin immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assay focused on active chromatin during transcriptional activation in the shmoo.
