Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the scenario described, λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules in a vacuum, determined by collisions between gas molecules. When an electron beam is introduced, electrons scatter off the gas molecules. The cross-section for electron-gas molecule interactions is typically larger than that for gas-gas interactions, leading to more frequent scattering events for electrons. This results in a shorter mean free path for electrons, λ2, compared to the mean free path for gas molecules, λ1. Therefore, based on the physical principles of electron scattering, λ2 is less than λ1. This conclusion is consistent with the reasoning provided by all debate agents, who agree that λ2 < λ1. Thus, the correct multiple-choice answer is C) λ2 < λ1.
