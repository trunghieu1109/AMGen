The apothem of a polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides, and in this case, all apothems are of equal length a. As N becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches the shape of a circle.

The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Since the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, when the polygon becomes a circle, this distance is the radius of the circle. Therefore, the diameter of the circular aperture is twice the radius, which means D = 2a.; answer - The relationship is that the polygon's apothem becomes the radius of the circular aperture, so the diameter D = 2a.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In the far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, the angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first zero of J1 is approximately 1.22, and the second zero is approximately 7.016. The formula for the angular position of the minima is θ = zero × λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. From Sub-task 2, we know that the diameter D = 2a.

The first zero is approximately 1.22, and the second zero is approximately 7.016. The formula for the angular position of the minima is θ = zero × λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. For a circular aperture with apothem a, the diameter D can be approximated as 2a. Therefore, the angular positions of the first two minima are θ1 = 1.22 × λ / (2a) and θ2 = 7.016 × λ / (2a). The angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ2 - θ1 = (7.016 - 1.22) × λ / (2a) = 5.796 × λ / (2a). Simplifying this gives Δθ = 2.898 × λ / a.

From Sub-task 3, the angular positions are θ1 = 1.22 × λ / (2a) and θ2 = 7.016 × λ / (2a). The angular distance Δθ is calculated as θ2 - θ1 = (7.016 × λ / (2a)) - (1.22 × λ / (2a)). This simplifies to Δθ = (7.016 - 1.22) × λ / (2a) = 5.796 × λ / (2a). Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is correctly calculated as 5.796 × λ / (2a). However, the problem context implies considering N as infinitely large, which means the aperture behaves like a circular one. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 × λ / (2a), which is 0.610 λ / a.
