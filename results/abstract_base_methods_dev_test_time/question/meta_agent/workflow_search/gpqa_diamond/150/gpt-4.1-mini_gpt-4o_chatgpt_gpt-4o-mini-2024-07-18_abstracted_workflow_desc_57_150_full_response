The matrix P is given as [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. We need to subtract λ times the identity matrix from P and find the determinant of the resulting matrix.

The matrix P is given by [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. We subtract λ from the diagonal elements to form P - λI, which is [[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]]. The determinant of this matrix is calculated as follows: det(P - λI) = -λ(-λ^2 + 1/2) - 1/2(1/2) = λ^3 - λ/2 - 1/4. Solving λ^3 - λ/2 - 1/4 = 0 gives us the eigenvalues. Upon solving, we find that the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = sqrt(2)/2, and λ = -sqrt(2)/2. For λ = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which simplifies to Pv = 0. Substituting P, we get the system of equations: 1/sqrt(2)v2 = 0, 1/sqrt(2)v1 + 1/sqrt(2)v3 = 0, 1/sqrt(2)v2 = 0. From these, we find v2 = 0, v1 + v3 = 0, giving eigenvectors of the form v = [1, 0, -1] and any scalar multiple.
