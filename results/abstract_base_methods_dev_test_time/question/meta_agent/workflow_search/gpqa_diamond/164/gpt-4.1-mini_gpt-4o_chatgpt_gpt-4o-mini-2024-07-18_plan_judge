Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The question asks for the correct statement regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene and a dual catalyst system. The sub-tasks confirm that all four statements are valid in their own right. However, the focus of the question is on the formation of the polymer with regular branches, which involves the specific catalyst system used. Statement 3 directly addresses the use of a group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators, which is relevant to the formation process itself. While statement 1 discusses the industrial implementation, statement 3 is more directly related to the chemical process of forming the polymer with regular branches. Therefore, statement 3 is the most relevant to the question's focus on the formation process.
