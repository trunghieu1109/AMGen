Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_157
proposed answer: The question involves understanding the effects of a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor. A dominant-negative mutation typically results in a loss-of-function phenotype because the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In this case, the mutation Y in the dimerization domain likely leads to the formation of non-functional dimers, which prevents the transcription factor from properly activating gene transcription. This interference can cause protein aggregation, as the mutant protein may form improper interactions with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. All debate agents agree that the most consistent outcome with a dominant-negative mutation is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype, as described in choice B. The other options do not align with the expected effects of a dominant-negative mutation, which typically results in a loss of function rather than a gain. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
