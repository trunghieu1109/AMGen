Quasars often show strong emission lines such as Lyman-alpha (rest wavelength 121.6 nm), C IV (rest wavelength 154.9 nm), Mg II (rest wavelength 279.8 nm), and H-alpha (rest wavelength 656.3 nm). Since the redshift of the quasar was determined to be approximately 5.5, we can use the redshift formula: observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). For the observed wavelength of 790 nm, we need to find which rest-frame wavelength corresponds to this when redshifted by a factor of 5.5. Calculating for the Lyman-alpha line: 121.6 nm * (1 + 5.5) = 790.4 nm, which matches closely with the observed 790 nm.
