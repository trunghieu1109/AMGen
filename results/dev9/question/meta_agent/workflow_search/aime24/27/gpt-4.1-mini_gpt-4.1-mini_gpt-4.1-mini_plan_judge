Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_7_27
proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the greatest four-digit number N satisfying the conditions is N = 5694, with digits a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. We compute Q and R where Q = floor(N/1000) and R = N mod 1000. For N=5694, Q = 5 and R = 694. Then Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.

Verification of divisibility conditions:
- Changing the thousands digit to 1: 1694. Check 1694 mod 7 = 0.
- Changing the hundreds digit to 1: 5194. Check 5194 mod 7 = 0.
- Changing the tens digit to 1: 5614. Check 5614 mod 7 = 0.
- Changing the units digit to 1: 5691. Check 5691 mod 7 = 0.

All these numbers are divisible by 7, confirming the correctness of N.

Therefore, the final answer Q + R = 699.

proposed answer: To confirm the sum Q + R for the number N = 5694, we proceed as follows: First, we find Q by dividing N by 1000 using integer division: Q = 5694 // 1000 = 5. Next, we find R by taking the remainder when N is divided by 1000: R = 5694 % 1000 = 694. Then, we sum Q and R: Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699. To verify correctness, we reconstruct N from Q and R: N = 1000 * Q + R = 1000 * 5 + 694 = 5694, which matches the original number. This confirms the decomposition and the sum Q + R is correct. Therefore, the final confirmed sum Q + R is 699.

proposed answer: We have found the greatest four-digit number N = 5694 such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. To verify, we check each digit replacement:
- Replace the thousands digit (5) with 1: 1694 is divisible by 7.
- Replace the hundreds digit (6) with 1: 5194 is divisible by 7.
- Replace the tens digit (9) with 1: 5614 is divisible by 7.
- Replace the units digit (4) with 1: 5691 is divisible by 7.

Next, compute Q and R:
Q = floor(5694 / 1000) = 5
R = 5694 mod 1000 = 694

Finally, Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.

All conditions are satisfied, and the answer is 699.

proposed answer: We are given a four-digit number N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We want to find the greatest such N. From the problem analysis and prior solutions, the greatest such number is N = 7562. We then decompose N into Q and R where Q is the quotient and R the remainder when dividing N by 1000. That is, Q = floor(7562 / 1000) = 7 and R = 7562 % 1000 = 562. The problem asks for Q + R, so we compute 7 + 562 = 569. This sum is consistent with the problem conditions and the decomposition of N. Therefore, the final answer is 569.

proposed answer: We are given a four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We want the greatest such N and then find Q and R where N = 1000Q + R, and compute Q + R.

Step 1: Define the four numbers formed by changing each digit to 1:
- Change thousands digit: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d
- Change hundreds digit: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d
- Change tens digit: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d
- Change units digit: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each must be divisible by 7.

Step 2: Use modular arithmetic mod 7. Note 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

Set up equations:
(6*1 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
(6a + 2*1 + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
(6a + 2b + 3*1 + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
(6a + 2b + 3c + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Subtract the last from the others to eliminate common terms:
1) d - 2b + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
2) d - 3c + 2 ≡ 0 mod 7
3) d - 6a + 5 ≡ 0 mod 7

Rewrite:
d ≡ 2b - 1 mod 7
d ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7
d ≡ 6a - 5 mod 7

Set right sides equal pairwise:
2b - 1 ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7 => 2b - 3c ≡ -1 mod 7
2b - 1 ≡ 6a - 5 mod 7 => 2b - 6a ≡ -4 mod 7
3c - 2 ≡ 6a - 5 mod 7 => 3c - 6a ≡ -3 mod 7

Step 3: Solve these modular equations for digits a,b,c (a in 1..9, b,c in 0..9).

Try a=5:
2b - 30 ≡ -4 mod 7 => 2b ≡ 26 mod 7 => 2b ≡ 5 mod 7
Try b=6 (2*6=12 ≡ 5 mod 7)

Check 2b - 3c ≡ -1 mod 7:
12 - 3c ≡ 6 mod 7 => -3c ≡ -6 mod 7 => 3c ≡ 6 mod 7
Try c=2 (3*2=6)

Check 3c - 6a ≡ -3 mod 7:
6 - 30 ≡ -3 mod 7 => -24 ≡ -3 mod 7
-24 mod 7 = 4, -3 mod 7 = 4, so correct.

Step 4: Find d:
d ≡ 2b - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 ≡ 4 mod 7
Try d=4 (digit)

Step 5: N=5624

Step 6: Verify divisibility:
Change thousands digit: 1624/7=232 (integer)
Change hundreds digit: 5124/7=732 (integer)
Change tens digit: 5614/7=802 (integer)
Change units digit: 5621/7=803 (integer)

All conditions hold.

Step 7: Check if greater N exists satisfying conditions. Attempts with higher a fail.

Step 8: Compute Q and R:
Q = 5 (thousands digit)
R = 624 (last three digits)
Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629

Final answer: 629
