Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).\n- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.\n- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q being the thousands digit and R the last three digits.\n- The task is to find Q + R.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- Changing one digit of N to 1 creates a new number divisible by 7. Since N has four digits, there are four such modified numbers, each differing from N in exactly one digit replaced by 1.\n- This implies a set of divisibility conditions modulo 7 for these four numbers.\n- The digits of N are interconnected through these modular constraints.\n- The problem requires identifying the greatest such N, so an ordering or maximization condition is involved.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.\n- Digit manipulation and properties of integers.\n- Possibly combinatorics related to digit choices.\n- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem does not explicitly state whether the digits of N can be zero except for the leading digit (which must be nonzero for a four-digit number).\n- It is assumed that changing a digit to 1 means replacing the digit at that position with 1 regardless of its original value.\n- The problem implicitly assumes standard base-10 representation.\n- Potential complexity arises from multiple divisibility conditions and the search for the greatest N satisfying them.\n- Assumptions: digits are from 0 to 9, leading digit ≥ 1, and the replacement digit is always 1.. \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 3: Using digit constraints and relationships from Sub-task 2, systematically find the greatest four-digit number N satisfying all divisibility conditions.

simultaneously.\n\nStep 1: Subtract (1) from (2):\n(2) - (1): (6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a + 2 - 6 - 2b ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a - 2b - 4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a - 2b ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nStep 2: Subtract (1) from (3):\n(3) - (1): (6a + 2b + 3 + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a + 3 - 6 - 3c ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a - 3c - 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a - 3c ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nStep 3: Subtract (1) from (4):\n(4) - (1): (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a + 1 - 6 - d ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a - d - 5 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n=> 6a - d ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nNow we have three simpler

3c - 2 (mod 7)\n\nSet equal:\n2b - 1 ≡ 3c - 2 (mod 7)\n=> 2b - 3c ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n\nThis matches (8), so consistent.\n\nNow try values of b and c in 0..9 to satisfy (8) 2b - 3c ≡ 6 (mod 7).\nTry c=0..9, for each find b:\nFor c=0: 2b ≡ 6 (mod 7) => b ≡ 3 (mod 7) => b=3 or 10(not digit)\nCheck b=3:\nThen d ≡ 2b -1 = 2*3 -1=5 (mod7), so d=5 or 12(not digit)\nAlso d ≡ 3c -2 = -2 ≡ 5 (mod7),

equations derived from the problem:\n\n(1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(2) 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(3) 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(4) 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nSubtracting (1) from (2), (3), and (4) respectively, we get:\n\n(5) 6a - 2b ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n(6) 6a - 3c ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n(7) 6a - d ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nRewrite these as:\n6a ≡ 4 + 2b (mod 7)\n6a ≡ 3 + 3c (mod 7)\n6a ≡ 5 + d (mod 7)\n\nSince all equal 6a mod 7, set equal:\n4 + 2b ≡ 3 + 3c ≡ 5 + d (mod 7)\n\nFrom these, derive three congruences:\n2b - 3c ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n2b - d ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n3c - d ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nExpress d from the second and third:\nd ≡ 2b - 1 (mod 7)\nd ≡ 3c - 2 (mod 7)\n\nEquate these to get:\n2b - 1 ≡ 3c - 2 (mod 7) => 2b - 3c ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n\nThis confirms consistency.\n\nWe enumerate digits b,c,d (0 to 9)

Replace a with 1: 1111 mod 7 = 1111 % 7 = 5 (not 0)\nFails.\n\nFor 8881:\n- Replace a with 1: 1881 % 7 = 1881 % 7 = 6 (not 0)\nFails.\n\nFor 7562:\n- Replace a with 1: 1562 % 7 = 1562 % 7 = 3 (not 0)\nFails.\n\nFor 6943:\n- Replace a with 1: 1943 % 7 = 1943 % 7 = 1 (not 0)\nFails.\n\nFor 5694:\n- Replace a with 1: 1694 % 7 = 0\n- Replace b with 1: 5194 % 7 = 0\n- Replace c with 1: 5614 % 7 = 0\n- Replace d with 1: 5691 % 7 = 0\n\nAll conditions hold for 5694.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such number N is 5694.\n\nFinally, Q = floor(5694/1000) = 5, R = 5694 mod 1000 = 694.\nQ + R = 5 + 694 =
