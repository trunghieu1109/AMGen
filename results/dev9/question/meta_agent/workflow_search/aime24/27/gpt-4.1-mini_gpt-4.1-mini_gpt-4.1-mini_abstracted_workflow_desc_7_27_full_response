Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\n\nDetailed Analysis: \n1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).\n- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.\n- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and 0 ≤ R < 1000.\n- The task is to find Q + R.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- Changing any single digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies a set of divisibility conditions for each digit position.\n- Since N has four digits, there are four such modified numbers, each differing from N in exactly one digit replaced by 1.\n- The divisibility by 7 condition imposes modular arithmetic constraints on N and its digits.\n- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying the property, the maximum is sought.\n- Q and R come from dividing N by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit and R is the last three digits.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- Number theory, specifically modular arithmetic and divisibility rules.\n- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and modular congruences.\n- Problem-solving typical in mathematical competitions.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem does not explicitly state whether digits can be changed to 1 even if they are already 1; presumably, changing a digit to 1 means replacing it regardless of its current value.\n- It is assumed that only one digit is changed at a time, not multiple digits simultaneously.\n- The problem does not specify if leading digit can be changed to 1 (which would still produce a four-digit number since 1xxx is four-digit).\n- The problem assumes standard decimal representation without leading zeros.\n- Potential complexity arises from multiple modular conditions and ensuring the greatest such number is found.\n- Reasonable assumptions include that the digit positions are thousands, hundreds, tens, and units from left to right, and that changing a digit to 1 always results in a valid four-digit number.. \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 1: Derive a formal representation of the problem. Define N as a four-digit number with digits a,b,c,d (thousands to units). Express the condition that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Formulate modular arithmetic equations for each digit change, considering place values and digit replacement effects. Validate assumptions about digit positions, digit ranges, and the divisibility constraints. Provide explicit modular congruences capturing all constraints needed for subsequent reasoning. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent CR5N:\nLet N be a four-digit number with digits a, b, c, d, where a is the thousands digit (1 ≤ a ≤ 9), and b, c, d are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively (0 ≤ b,c,d ≤ 9).
