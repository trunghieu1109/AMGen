Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_14
proposed answer: The supremum of BD^2 from subtask 6 is +∞. The set of integers strictly less than +∞ is all integers, which has no maximum element. Hence there is no greatest integer strictly less than the supremum.

Answer:No greatest integer exists
Extracted answer: No greatest integer exists
Correct answer: 480
Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_14
proposed answer: From Sub-task 8 we determined that the function f(t) describing BD^2 over all valid rhombi has an infimum of 480. In Sub-task 10 we are asked to return that infimum as an integer. Therefore, the required integer value is 480.
