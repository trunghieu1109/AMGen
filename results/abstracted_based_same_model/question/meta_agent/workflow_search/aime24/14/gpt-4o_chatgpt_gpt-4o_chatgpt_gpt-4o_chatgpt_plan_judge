Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: Both agents have calculated BD^2 using the coordinates of points B and D on the hyperbola. They used the distance formula to find BD^2, which is the sum of the squares of the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates of B and D. The calculations show that BD^2 = 176. Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, and given that 176 is the maximum value of BD^2 for the configuration described, the greatest real number less than 176 is 175. Both agents agree on this conclusion, and the reasoning is consistent with the problem's requirements.

proposed answer: To find the expression for BD^2, we use the parameterization from subtask 3. The points B and D are given by B=(\(\sqrt{20} \cosh(s), \sqrt{24} \sinh(s)\)) and D=(-\(\sqrt{20} \cosh(s), -\sqrt{24} \sinh(s)\)). The distance BD is the Euclidean distance between these two points. We have:

BD^2 = ((-\(\sqrt{20} \cosh(s)\) - \(\sqrt{20} \cosh(s)\))^2 + (-\(\sqrt{24} \sinh(s)\) - \(\sqrt{24} \sinh(s)\))^2)

= (2\(\sqrt{20} \cosh(s)\))^2 + (2\(\sqrt{24} \sinh(s)\))^2

= 4(20 \cosh^2(s) + 24 \sinh^2(s))

= 4(20(\cosh^2(s) - \sinh^2(s)) + 24 \sinh^2(s))

= 4(20 \cdot 1 + 24 \sinh^2(s))

= 80 + 96 \sinh^2(s)

To find the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, we need to consider the condition \(t+s = \text{arctanh}(-\frac{1}{5})\). Since \(\cosh(t+s) = -\frac{1}{5} \sinh(t+s)\), we use the identity \(\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1\) and the fact that \(\sinh(t+s) = -5 \cosh(t+s)\) to find that \(\sinh^2(t+s) = 25 \cosh^2(t+s)\). Therefore, \(\cosh^2(t+s) - 25 \cosh^2(t+s) = 1\) gives \(\cosh^2(t+s) = -\frac{1}{24}\), which is not possible. Thus, we need to find the maximum \(\sinh^2(s)\) under valid conditions.

The maximum value of \(\sinh^2(s)\) occurs when \(\cosh(s)\) is minimized, and since \(\cosh^2(s) - \sinh^2(s) = 1\), the greatest value of \(\sinh^2(s)\) corresponds to the smallest possible \(\cosh^2(s)\). Given the constraint, the maximum \(\sinh^2(s)\) is when \(\sinh^2(s)\) approaches infinity, but practically, we find that the maximum finite value of \(\sinh^2(s)\) that satisfies the conditions is when \(t = s = 0\), giving the greatest possible BD^2 as 80. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 79.
