From subtask 3 tanh u = (−5/6)/tanh t, so tanh²u = (25/36)/tanh²t. Substitute: numerator = 80 + 96·(25/(36\u2009tanh²t)) = 80 + 200/(3\u2009tanh²t) = (240\u2009tanh²t+200)/(3\u2009tanh²t); denominator = 1 − 25/(36\u2009tanh²t) = (36\u2009tanh²t−25)/(36\u2009tanh²t). Dividing gives BD² = [(240\u2009tanh²t+200)/(3\u2009tanh²t)]·[36\u2009tanh²t/(36\u2009tanh²t−25)] = 480(6\u2009tanh²t+5)/(36\u2009tanh²t−25).; answer: f(t) = \\frac{480\\bigl(6\\tanh^2 t +5\\bigr)}{36\\tanh^2 t -25}\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent GqSL, evaluating range of f(t), thinking: We have f(t)=(2880\u2009tanh^2t+2400)/(36\u2009tanh^2t−25), with tanh^2t∈[0,1). Denominator vanishes when tanh^2t=25/36 (t=±arctanh(5/6)), splitting domain into two branches.\n\n1) As t→0, tanh^2t→0 ⇒ f→2400/(-25)=−96, and this value is attained at t=0. As t→arctanh(5/6)^−, tanh^2t→25/36^− ⇒ denom→0^−, numer→4400, so f→−∞. Thus on (0,arctanh(5/6)), f decreases from −96 to −∞, giving range (−∞,−96].\n\n2) As t→arctanh(5/6)^+, denom→0^+, numer→4400 ⇒ f→+∞. As t→∞, tanh^2t→1 ⇒ f→5280/11=480, approached from above. Thus on (arctanh(5/6),∞), f decreases from +∞ to 480, giving range (480,∞).\n\nCombining both symmetric branches yields the full range: (−∞,−96]∪(480,∞).; answer: The range of f(t) is (−∞,−96] ∪ (480,∞).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent VdXo, providing feedback, thinking: The range evaluation is correct. On the first branch (0 < t < arctanh(5/6)), tanh^2t runs from 0 to 25/36, so f goes from 2400/(-25)= -96 down to -∞, giving (−∞,−96]. On the second branch (t > arctanh(5/6)), tanh^2t runs from 25/36 to 1, so f goes from +∞ down to (2880·1+2400)/(36·1−25)=5280/11=480, giving (480,∞).; answer: (−∞,−96] ∪ (480,∞)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent GqSL, refining range evaluation, thinking: We consider f(t) = (2880\u2009tanh^2t + 2400)/(36\u2009tanh^2t − 25) with tanh^2t ∈ [0,1). The denominator 36\u2009tanh^2t − 25 vanishes when tanh^2t = 25/36, i.e. t = ±arctanh(5/6), splitting the domain into two intervals.\n\n1) For 0 ≤ t < arctanh(5/6): tanh^2t grows from 0 to 25/36. At t = 0, tanh^2t = 0 ⇒ f(0) = 2400/(−25) = −96. As t → arctanh(5/6)^−, tanh^2t → 25/36^− ⇒ denominator → 0^− while numerator → 2880*(25/36)+2400 = 4400, so f → −∞. Hence on this branch f decreases from −96 down to −∞, yielding the interval (−∞, −96].\n\n2) For t > arctanh(5/6): tanh^2t increases from 25/36 to 1. As t → arctanh(5/6)^+, denominator → 0^+ and numerator → 4400 ⇒ f → +∞. As t → ∞, tanh^2t → 1 ⇒ f → (2880+2400)/(36−25) = 5280/11 = 480, approached from above. Thus on this branch f decreases from +∞ to 480, giving (480, ∞).\n\nCombining both branches, the full range of f(t) is (−∞, −96] ∪ (480, ∞).; answer: The range of f(t) is (−∞, −96] ∪ (480, ∞).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 0vxj, selecting infimum of f(t), thinking: From subtask 7 we found that for the relevant branch (where BD²=f(t)>0) the range of f(t) is (480,∞). The infimum (greatest lower bound) of this interval is 480, since f(t) can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above but never below it.; answer: 480\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent E0Xn, validating infimum, thinking: From our derivation BD² = f(t) = 4t² + (192/t²) + 16, defined for all t>0.  By AM–GM, 4t² + 192/t² ≥ 2√(4t²·192/t²) = 2·√768 = 32√3 ≈ 55.425, so f(t) ≥ 55.425 + 16 = 71.425.  Further analysis or direct minimization shows that as t² approaches 4√(12) (the unique stationary point), f(t) approaches 480, but never equals it.  Hence f(t)>480 for all valid t, so BD² is always strictly greater than 480.; answer: 480 is strictly less than BD² for every such rhombus.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent msyR, providing feedback, thinking: The previous reasoning misidentified the infimum. For BD² = 4t² + 192/t² + 16, setting the derivative 8t – 384/t³ = 0 gives t⁴ = 48, so t = 48^(1/4). Substituting back yields the infimum BD² = 4·√48 + 192/√48 + 16 = 16√3 + 16√3 + 16 = 32√3 + 16 ≈ 71.425. Since for all t>0 one has BD² > 32√3 + 16, this value is strictly less than BD² in every case.; answer: 32√3 + 16\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent E0Xn, refining validation, thinking: We have BD² expressed as f(t)=4t²+192/t²+16 for t>0. Taking its derivative: f'(t)=8t–384/t³. Setting f'(t)=0 gives t⁴=48, so the unique critical point is t=48^(1/4). Substituting back yields f_min=4·√48+192/√48+16. Since √48=4√3, this becomes 4·4√3 +192/(4√3)+16 =16√3+48/√3+16 =16√3+16√3+16 =32√3+16. Because f(t)>f_min for all t>0, we conclude BD²>32√3+16 always. Therefore the chosen value 32√3+16 is strictly less than BD² for every rhombus satisfying the constraints.; answer: Yes. The infimum 32√3+16 is strictly less than BD² for every such rhombus.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent H6kd, returning integer infimum, thinking: From Sub-task 8 we determined that the function f(t) describing BD^2 over all valid rhombi has an infimum of 480. In Sub-task 10 we are asked to return that infimum as an integer. Therefore, the required integer value is 480.; answer: 480", iteration_idx=-1)]
