Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions originally red is 17/32, where 17 and 32 are relatively prime. Here, m = 17 and n = 32. The problem asks for m + n, which is 17 + 32 = 49.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions originally red is given as the fraction 29/128 in lowest terms. Here, m=29 and n=128 are coprime. The problem asks for m+n, which is 29+128=157.
