Since |B|=4 and r_k(B) also has size 4, disjointness forces r_k(B)=B^c. Thus B+k≡B^c, so B+2k≡(B^c)+k=(B+k)^c=B^{cc}=B. Hence 2k≡0 mod\u20098 and k≠0, so k≡4.

Equivalently B∩(B+k)=∅ and |B|=4 forces B+k to be the complement of B.  Hence r_k(B)=B^c, so 2k must give a symmetry of B (r_{2k}(B)=B).  Excluding k=4 (which would force B=B^c impossible), the only possible orders are 2k≡4 mod 8 (k=2 or 6), giving invariance under rotation by 4.
