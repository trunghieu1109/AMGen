Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: Both Debate Agent xTB6 and Debate Agent 1Svd independently concluded that there are no ordered triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying the given sum and polynomial conditions simultaneously. Their reasoning involved expressing the polynomial in terms of symmetric sums and verifying the feasibility of the conditions, ultimately finding no valid solutions. Since both agents agree and their analyses are consistent and thorough, the final count of such ordered triples is zero.

proposed answer: Based on the final decision in Sub-task 5, the only practical way to find all triples (a,b,c) satisfying the given conditions is to enumerate all triples with a+b+c=300 and check the polynomial condition 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Without computational tools here, I cannot explicitly enumerate and count the solutions. However, the problem is symmetric in a,b,c, and the polynomial condition is quite restrictive, so the number of solutions is expected to be small. Since the problem statement and previous analysis do not provide explicit solutions or counts, and enumeration is required, the exact count cannot be determined here. Therefore, the answer is that the number of such triples is unknown without computational enumeration, but the method to verify them is to check both the sum and polynomial conditions exactly for each candidate triple found by enumeration.

Answer:The exact number of triples (a,b,c) satisfying a+b+c=300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 cannot be determined without computational enumeration. Verification requires checking both conditions exactly for each candidate triple found by enumeration.

Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, the only triple (a, b, c) found that satisfies the conditions a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 is (100, 100, 100). This triple satisfies the sum condition since 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. It also satisfies the polynomial condition as verified by the symmetric sums S2 = 30,000 and S3 = 1,000,000, which correspond to the polynomial with roots a, b, c. The polynomial has a triple root at 100, confirming the uniqueness of the solution. Therefore, the count of distinct nonnegative integer triples satisfying both conditions is exactly 1.
