Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: From the previous analysis, we determined that there are 45,451 possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation a + b + c = 300. However, when considering the additional condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000, we found that only the triple (100, 100, 100) satisfies both conditions. This is because the expression a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) simplifies to 3 * 100^2 * 200 = 6,000,000 when a = b = c = 100. The problem is highly constrained, and the specific form of the second condition makes it unlikely for other combinations to satisfy it given the first condition. Therefore, there is only one valid triple that satisfies both conditions.

proposed answer: From the previous subtasks, we have determined that the only valid solution to the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000, given a + b + c = 300, is the triple (150, 75, 75) and its permutations. The permutations of (150, 75, 75) are (150, 75, 75), (75, 150, 75), and (75, 75, 150). Each of these permutations represents a distinct ordering of the values a, b, and c. Therefore, there are 3 valid triples that satisfy both conditions.
