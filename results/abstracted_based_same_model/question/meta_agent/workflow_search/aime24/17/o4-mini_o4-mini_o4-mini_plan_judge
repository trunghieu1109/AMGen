Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: We observed the identity E=300(ab+bc+ca)−3abc equals 6 000 000 precisely for all triples of the form (x,100,200−x) with x∈ℤ, 0≤x≤200, since
  ab+bc+ca = x·100 + x·(200−x) + 100·(200−x)
               = 200x − x² + 20 000
⇒ 300S = 6 000 000 + (300x(200−x)),
and abc=100x(200−x) makes 3abc=300x(200−x), so E=6 000 000 for any x.  
Counting unordered triples amounts to x from 0 to 100 (beyond that we repeat), giving 101 distinct sorted triples.  Among these only x=100 yields (100,100,100) with 1 permutation; all other 100 values give three distinct entries and each yields 6 permutations.  Thus total =100·6 + 1 = 601.
