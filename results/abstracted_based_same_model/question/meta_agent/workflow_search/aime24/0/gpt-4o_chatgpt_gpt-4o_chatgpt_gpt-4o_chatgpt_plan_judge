Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_0
proposed answer: In sub-task 5, we calculated the walking time for Aya when she walks at 3.5 km/h. The walking time was found to be approximately 154.2857 minutes. We also determined that the time spent in the coffee shop, t, is 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time, including the coffee shop time, is 154.2857 + 60 = 214.2857 minutes. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 214 minutes. This calculation is consistent with the problem's conditions and the previous sub-task's findings.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_0
proposed answer: In sub-task 5, it was determined that Aya walks 9 kilometers at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, which is 3 km/h, taking 3 hours or 180 minutes. The time spent in the coffee shop, t, was found to be 24 minutes from the problem constraints. Therefore, the total time including the coffee shop time is 180 minutes + 24 minutes = 204 minutes. This aligns with the problem constraints and previous findings.
