Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 8 we have the simplified form r = (20âˆš21)/63, so m = 20, n = 21, and p = 63. These satisfy gcd(20,63)=1 and 21 is squarefree. Therefore, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.
