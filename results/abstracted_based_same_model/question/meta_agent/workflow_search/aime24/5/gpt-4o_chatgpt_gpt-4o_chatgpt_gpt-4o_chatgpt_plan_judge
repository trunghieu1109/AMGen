Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The expression for the distance from the incenter to the faces of the tetrahedron is given as \( \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{5} \). This is already in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 5 \). We check that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime: \( \gcd(6, 5) = 1 \), so they are relatively prime. The number \( n = 2 \) is not divisible by the square of any prime, as 2 is a prime number itself. Therefore, the expression is already in the desired form. We have \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 5 \), so \( m + n + p = 6 + 2 + 5 = 13 \).

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) as \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{6} \). This corresponds to \( m = 1 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 6 \). The problem asks for the sum \( m + n + p \). Therefore, we calculate \( 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 \). This matches the conditions given: \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Thus, the sum \( m + n + p = 9 \) is correct.
