Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the inradius is expressed as (18âˆš861) / 4469, where m = 18, n = 861, and p = 4469. These satisfy the conditions: m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. The problem asks for the sum m + n + p. Calculating this sum: 18 + 861 + 4469 = 5350. Therefore, the final answer is 5350.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the inradius was expressed in the form m * sqrt(n) / p as 24 * sqrt(1) / 49. Here, m = 24, n = 1, and p = 49. These satisfy the conditions: m and p are coprime (24 and 49 share no common factors), and n = 1 is square-free. The problem asks for the sum m + n + p. Calculating this sum: 24 + 1 + 49 = 74.
