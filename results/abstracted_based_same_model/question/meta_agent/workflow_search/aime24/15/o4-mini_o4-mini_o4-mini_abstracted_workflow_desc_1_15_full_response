Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Since every resident owns candy hearts, the union of all four sets is all 900 residents. By inclusion–exclusion: |A∪B∪C∪D| = sum of singles – sum of pairwise intersections + sum of triple intersections – |all four|. We know sum of singles = 195+367+562+900 = 2024. From Sub-task 3, sum of all pairwise intersections = 1139 + 6E4. From the problem, E3=234 and sum of triple intersections = E3·1 + E4·4 = 234 + 4E4. Let E4 be the number owning all four. Then \n900 = 2024 – (1139 + 6E4) + (234 + 4E4) – E4\nSimplify: 900 = 2024 – 1139 – 6E4 + 234 + 4E4 – E4 = (2024 – 1139 + 234) + (–6+4–1)E4 = 1119 – 3E4\nSo –3E4 = 900 – 1119 = –219, hence E4 = 73.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4BIz:\n73\n\n### Sub-task 5: Verify E4 is nonnegative integer and consistent by substituting back into pairwise and triple sum formulas and checking the inclusion–exclusion equation. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9AIf (yourself):\nFirst, we check that E4=73 is a nonnegative integer (it is). Next, compute the sums with E4=73:\n• Sum of pairwise intersections =1139+6·73=1139+438=1577\n• Sum of triple intersections =234+4·73=234+292=526\n• Sum of singles =195+367+562+900=2024\nNow apply inclusion–exclusion:\n|A∪B∪C∪D|=2024–1577+526–73= (2024–1577)=447; 447+526=973; 973–73=900, which matches the total 900 residents. This confirms E4=73 is consistent.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9AIf (yourself):\nYes. E4=73 is a nonnegative integer, and substituting back yields 2024–(1139+6·73)+(234+4·73)–73=900, so the inclusion–exclusion equation holds.\n\n### Please review the verification and indicate if the checks are valid. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent sRE8:\nThe verification appropriately confirms that E4=73 is a nonnegative integer, correctly recalculates the total pairwise intersection sum (1139+6·73=1577) and the total triple intersection sum (234+4·73=526), and then applies the inclusion–exclusion formula 2024−1577+526−73=900 to match the total population.
