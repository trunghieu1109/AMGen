Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: We start with the inclusion–exclusion equation as given: 900 = (195 + 367 + 562 + 900) – 437 + 234 – x. First compute the sum of single‐item owners: 195 + 367 = 562, 562 + 562 = 1124, 1124 + 900 = 2024. Then subtract the two‐item owners: 2024 – 437 = 1587. Add the three‐item owners: 1587 + 234 = 1821. So the equation becomes 900 = 1821 – x, which rearranges to x = 1821 – 900 = 921. This value is clearly a nonnegative integer, satisfying the requirement.

proposed answer: We verify that E4=73 is a nonnegative integer. Sum of singles: 195+367+562+900=2024. Sum of pairwise intersections: 1139+6×73=1577. Sum of triple intersections: 234+4×73=526. Applying inclusion–exclusion: 2024−1577+526−73=(2024−1577)=447; 447+526=973; 973−73=900, which matches the total population of 900. Thus E4=73 satisfies all requirements.

Answer:Yes, the verification checks are valid: E4=73 is nonnegative, and substituting back yields 2024−(1139+6·73)+(234+4·73)−73=900, so the inclusion–exclusion equation holds.
