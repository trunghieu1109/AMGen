Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Both Debate Agent xbJB and Debate Agent KCde independently solved the system of equations derived from the problem's conditions and arrived at the same result: 73 residents own all four items. The equations used were x1 + x4 = 229 and x1 + 4*x4 = 448, where x1 is the number of residents owning exactly one item and x4 is the number owning all four items. By subtracting the first equation from the second, they found 3*x4 = 219, leading to x4 = 73. This solution is consistent with the inclusion-exclusion principle and aligns with the given data about residents owning exactly two and exactly three items. Therefore, the final decision is that 73 residents own all four items.
