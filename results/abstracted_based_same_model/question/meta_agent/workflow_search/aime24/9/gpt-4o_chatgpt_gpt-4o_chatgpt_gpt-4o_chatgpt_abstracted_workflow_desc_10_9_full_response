Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

The number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). Here, n = 10 and k = 4, so we calculate C(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * 6!). This simplifies to (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210.

There are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to do this. \n- Choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 numbers that Jen did not pick (since 4 numbers are chosen from the set of 10, and 4 are Jen's, 10 - 4 = 6 numbers are not picked by Jen). There are C(6, 2) = 15 ways to do this. \n- Total for this case = 6 * 15 = 90 ways.\n\nCase 2: Exactly 3 of Jen's numbers match the chosen numbers. \n- Choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4 numbers to match the chosen numbers. There are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to do this. \n- The remaining 1 number must be chosen from the 6 numbers Jen did not pick. There are C(6, 1) = 6 ways to do this. \n- Total for this case = 4 * 6 = 24 ways.\n\nCase 3: All 4 of Jen's numbers match the chosen numbers. \n- This means all of Jen's numbers are the chosen numbers, which is only 1 way (since she must have picked the exact 4 numbers that are chosen).\n\nAdding these up gives the total number of ways Jen can win a prize: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 ways.; answer - 115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To win the grand prize, Jen's 4 chosen numbers must exactly match the 4 numbers randomly chosen from the set S.
