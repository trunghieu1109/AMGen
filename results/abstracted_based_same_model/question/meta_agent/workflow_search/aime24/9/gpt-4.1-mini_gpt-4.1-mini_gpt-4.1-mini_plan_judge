Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize is the ratio of the number of winning outcomes for the grand prize to the total number of winning outcomes for the prize. From the previous sub-task, the total winning outcomes for the prize (at least 2 matches) is 115, and the winning outcomes for the grand prize (all 4 matches) is 1. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. This fraction is already in lowest terms since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1. Hence, m = 1 and n = 115, and m + n = 116.
