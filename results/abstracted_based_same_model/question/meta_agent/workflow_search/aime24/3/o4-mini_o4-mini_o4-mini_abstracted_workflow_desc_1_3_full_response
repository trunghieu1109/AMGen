Solving f(u)=¼ yields u=¼ or ¾, so we partition u∈[0,1] into four intervals: [0,¼], [¼,½], [½,¾], [¾,1].\n3. On each interval we substitute f(u) and evaluate g(f)=±(f(u)−¼), then multiply by 4 to get h=4·g(f).  This yields four linear formulas in u.\n4. Since u=|sin(2πx)| has fundamental period ½, h(x) also has period ½.  Its maximum value is 1 (at u=0,½,1) and minimum 0 (at u=¼,¾), so range [0,1].\n5. To describe subintervals in x for one period x∈[0,½], we solve |sin(2πx)|=¼,½,¾ giving x₁=arcsin(¼)/(2π), x₂=arcsin(½)/(2π)=1/12, x₃=arcsin(¾)/(2π), x₄=arcsin(1)/(2π)=1/4.\nThus on [0,½] we have four subintervals [0,x₁], [x₁,x₂], [x₂,x₃], [x₃,x₄] over which h takes the four linear forms in u.; answer: h(x)=4·g(f(sin(2πx))) depends only on u=|sin(2πx)| and is given by the following piecewise linear formulas in one period [0,½] (extended periodically with period ½):\n\nLet u=|sin(2πx)|.

If ¾≤u≤1, f(u)=u−½≥¼,  g(f)=f−¼=u−¾,  so h(x)=4(u−¾)=4u−3.\n\nRange: [0,1].\nFundamental period: ½.\n\nCritical x‐values in [0,½] are\nx₁=arcsin(¼)/(2π),  x₂=arcsin(½)/(2π)=1/12,  x₃=arcsin(¾)/(2π),  x₄=arcsin(1)/(2π)=1/4.\nHence the subintervals of x in [0,½] are\n[0,x₁], [x₁,x₂], [x₂,x₃], [x₃,x₄],\non which h(x) follows the four formulas above in place of u=|sin(2πx)|.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent LYlE, deriving k(y), thinking: We need k(y)=4g(f(cos(3πy))).  From Sub‐tasks 1–2 we have f(x)=||x|−½| piecewise on x∈[−1,1], and g(x)=||x|−¼| piecewise on x∈[0,½].  Since u=cos(3πy)∈[−1,1], substitute u into f’s four linear pieces to get v=f(u)∈[0,½], then into g’s two linear pieces separated at v=¼.  This yields eight linear formulas in u=cos(3πy).  Multiplying by 4 gives k(y) piecewise in cos(3πy).  The breakpoints in y are exactly the solutions of cos(3πy)=±¾,±½,±¼,±1 on one period of cos, i.e. y∈[0,2/3].  k(y) oscillates between 0 and 1 and repeats every T=2/3.  The eight u‐intervals I₁=[−1,−¾],I₂=[−¾,−½],I₃=[−½,−¼],I₄=[−¼,0],I₅=[0,¼],I₆=[¼,½],I₇=[½,¾],I₈=[¾,1] pull back under y↦cos(3πy) to eight y‐subintervals in [0,2/3] where k has a single linear‐in‐cos(3πy) formula.  On each I_j one checks whether f(u)≶¼ to determine whether g(v)=v−¼ or ¼−v, giving k(y)=4(f(u)−¼) or 4(¼−f(u)).  One finds explicitly:  for u∈I₁: k=−4u−3; I₂: 4u+3; I₃: −4u−1; I₄: 4u+1; I₅: 1−4u; I₆: 4u−1; I₇: 3−4u; I₈: 4u−3, with u=cos(3πy).  Hence Range[k]=[0,1], Period=2/3, and subintervals of y are the preimages of the eight I_j under y↦cos(3πy) in [0,2/3].; answer: Let u=cos(3πy).

The breakpoints u∈{−1,−¾,−½,−¼,0,¼,½,¾,1} are rightly pulled back through cos(3πy) over one period [0,2/3], yielding eight subintervals. One limitation is that the explicit y‐interval endpoints require solving cos(3πy)=constant on each monotone arc of cos, so the subintervals are described implicitly rather than in closed form. Also, the linear formulas are given in u, not directly in y, so one must remember to compose with u=cos(3πy). Overall, the derivation is sound.; correct: Yes\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent LYlE, refining k(y), thinking: We compose k(y)=4g(f(cos(3πy))).  From Sub‐tasks 1 and 2 we have f and g piecewise linear on the nodal intervals where |x|=½ and |x|=¼.  Write u=cos(3πy)∈[−1,1].  Then f(u) splits at u=±½ into four linear pieces, and g(v) with v=f(u) splits at v=±¼ into two.  Chaining these and multiplying by 4 gives eight explicit formulas in u, each valid on successive u‐intervals determined by the breakpoints u=−1,−¾,−½,−¼,0,¼,½,¾,1.  The fundamental period of cos(3πy) is T=2/3 so k(y) repeats every 2/3.  Its range is the image of these linear pieces over u∈[−1,1], namely [0,1].  The corresponding y‐subintervals in one period [0,2/3] are exactly the preimages of these eight u‐intervals under y↦cos(3πy), taken on the two monotone halves [0,1/3] (cos decreasing) and [1/3,2/3] (cos increasing).; answer: Let u=cos(3πy).

The fundamental period is T=2/3, the range of k is [0,1], and the eight subintervals of y in [0,2/3] are the preimages under y↦cos(3πy) of the above u‐intervals on each monotone arc of cos (decreasing on [0,1/3], increasing on [1/3,2/3]).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent wvMa, listing branches of h, thinking: Subtask 3 showed that letting u=|sin(2πx)| reduces h(x)=4·g(f(u)) to four linear pieces in the variable u on [0,1], namely\n 1) h=1−4u on [0,¼]\n 2) h=4u−1 on [¼,½]\n 3) h=3−4u on [½,¾]\n 4) h=4u−3 on [¾,1].\nThese are the four “branches” of h as a function of its input u (which runs from 0 to 1 in one half‐period of x).
