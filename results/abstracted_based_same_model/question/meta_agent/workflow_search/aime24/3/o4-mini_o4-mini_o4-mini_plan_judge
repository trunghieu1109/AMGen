Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: From Sub-task 7 we found that within the fundamental period [0,1]^2 the only solution to the system is the single point (1,1). Since both equations are periodic in x with period 1 and in y with period 2/3 (but their intersection aligns only at integer grid points), no additional intersections arise outside the fundamental cell beyond integer shifts. Thus the total count of intersection points is 1.

proposed answer: The graphs repeat with period 1 in x and period 2/3 in y. In each fundamental cell [0,1)Ã—[0,2/3) there are 16 intersection points. Applying all integer shifts in x and all integer multiples of 2/3 in y produces infinitely many cells, each contributing the same 16 points. Hence the total number of intersection points in the plane is infinite.
