        "To reconcile discrepancies between analytic and numerical intersection counts, carefully review and refine both approaches. Increase numerical grid resolution and verify sign change detection to avoid missing intersections. Re-examine analytic derivations for completeness and correctness. Use alternative numerical methods if needed to cross-validate results. Acknowledge limitations such as computational cost of high-resolution grids, potential numerical instability in root-finding algorithms, and assumptions in analytic methods that might overlook some solutions. After these steps, the counts should align, ensuring the final intersection number is consistent and correct.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
