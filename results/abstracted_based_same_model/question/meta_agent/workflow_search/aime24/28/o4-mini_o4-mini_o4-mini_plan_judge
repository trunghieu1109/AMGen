Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We set up the cross‐section through the torus axis: the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius a=3 whose center is at distance R=6 from the axis. Place the torus fixed around the vertical z‐axis and let the sphere of radius S=11 have center on that axis at height h, so that it is tangent to the torus along a horizontal circle of radius r.  In the vertical cross‐section, the tangent point (r,z) must lie on both the sphere and the generating circle, and the normal to the torus there (the line from the generating‐circle center (R,0) to (r,z)) must pass through the sphere center (0,h).  Writing these conditions and eliminating z and h yields the quartic which collapses to the simple relation

    a^2 r^2 = S^2 (r - R)^2  .

 Hence 

    ar = ±S(r - R)

giving the two real solutions

    r = S R/(S - a) = (11·6)/(11–3) = 66/8 = 33/4, 
and
    r = S R/(S + a) = 66/14 = 33/7.

These are the two possible contact‐circle radii r_i=33/4 and r_o=33/7.  Therefore

    Δr = r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 33·(7-4)/28 = 99/28,

so m=99, n=28, and m+n = 127.

Answer:Δr = 99/28 and m+n = 127
Extracted answer: Δr = 99/28 and m+n = 127
Correct answer: 127
