Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o to be expressed as a fraction with positive integers m and n, where m and n are relatively prime. The calculated difference is -6, which can be expressed as the fraction -6/1. However, to meet the problem's requirement for positive integers, we take the absolute value, resulting in 6/1. Here, m = 6 and n = 1, which are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the sum m + n = 6 + 1 = 7. This approach aligns with the problem's requirement to express the difference as a fraction with positive integers.

proposed answer: In sub-task 5, the difference r_i - r_o was determined to be 6, which is expressed as the fraction 6/1. Here, the numerator m is 6 and the denominator n is 1. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator, which is m + n = 6 + 1. Therefore, the sum is 7. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the values obtained in sub-task 5.
