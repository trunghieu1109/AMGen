Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, the difference r_i - r_o was found to be -1, which can be expressed as the fraction -1/1. Since m and n must be positive integers and relatively prime, we take m = 1 and n = 1. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 1 + 1 = 2. This is consistent with the previous calculations and interpretations, confirming that the final answer is 2.

proposed answer: Both agents agree that the difference r_i - r_o is 36/35 in simplest form, with numerator 36 and denominator 35 being relatively prime positive integers. The problem asks for the sum m + n where r_i - r_o = m/n. Adding these gives 36 + 35 = 71. There is no contradiction or error in the reasoning, and the fraction is already simplified. Therefore, the final answer is 71.
