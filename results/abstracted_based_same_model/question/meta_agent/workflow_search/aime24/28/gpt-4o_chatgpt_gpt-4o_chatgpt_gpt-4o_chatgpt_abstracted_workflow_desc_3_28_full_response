Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

This means the center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution. The equation for a torus in 3D space, when the circle is in the xy-plane and the axis of revolution is the z-axis, is given by (√(x²+y²) − R)² + z² = r², where R is the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution (6 in this case), and r is the radius of the circle being revolved (3 in this case). Therefore, the equation for the torus T is (√(x²+y²) − 6)² + z² = 3². The sphere S has a radius of 11, and its center is at the origin. The equation for a sphere with center at the origin and radius R is x² + y² + z² = R². Therefore, the equation for the sphere S is x² + y² + z² = 11².; answer - The torus is defined by the equation (√(x²+y²) − 6)² + z² = 3², and the sphere is defined by the equation x² + y² + z² = 11².\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the intersection of the torus and the sphere, we need to solve the system of equations given by the torus and the sphere. The torus is described by the equation (√(x²+y²) − 6)² + z² = 3², and the sphere is described by the equation x² + y² + z² = 11². We are particularly interested in the set of points (x, y, 0) that are common to both surfaces. For the torus, when z = 0, the equation simplifies to (√(x²+y²) − 6)² = 3², which implies √(x²+y²) = 6 ± 3, giving us √(x²+y²) = 9 or √(x²+y²) = 3. This means that the possible radii of the circles of intersection in the xy-plane are 9 and 3. For the sphere, setting z = 0 gives x² + y² = 11² = 121. The intersection of these circles with the sphere's projection in the xy-plane will give us the circles of tangency. Solving for the intersection of x² + y² = 81 (from √(x²+y²) = 9) and x² + y² = 121, we find that these do not intersect, so the larger circle of radius 9 does not intersect the sphere. Solving for the intersection of x² + y² = 9 (from √(x²+y²) = 3) and x² + y² = 121, these also do not intersect. Thus, the circle of tangency occurs at the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere, which correspond to the circles of radius 9 and 3, but the tangency occurs at the maximum and minimum radii of the torus's cross-section, which are 9 and 3 respectively.

The torus has the equation (√(x²+y²) − 6)² + z² = 3², and the sphere has the equation x² + y² + z² = 11². We are looking for the set of points (x, y, z) that lie on both surfaces. Since we are interested in the circle of tangency, we can assume without loss of generality that the circle lies in the plane z = 0, as the torus is symmetric around the z-axis. Substituting z = 0 into the sphere's equation gives x² + y² = 11². Substituting z = 0 into the torus's equation gives (√(x²+y²) − 6)² = 3². Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the circle of intersection. For the torus equation, (√(x²+y²) − 6)² = 9 implies √(x²+y²) = 9 or √(x²+y²) = 3. Therefore, x² + y² = 81 or x² + y² = 9. However, x² + y² = 81 cannot be satisfied simultaneously with x² + y² = 11², as it would imply 81 = 121, which is false. Thus, x² + y² = 9 is the only possible solution. Therefore, the intersection is a circle in the plane z = 0 with radius √9 = 3.

The sphere S has radius 11, described by x² + y² + z² = 11². When the torus T is externally tangent to the sphere S on the inside, it means the torus is positioned such that its inner circle of revolution (at radius 3 from the center of the torus) is tangent to the sphere. This occurs when the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8, because the sphere's radius is 11 and the torus's inner circle has radius 3.

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere on the inside, it is touching the sphere at this inner radius.
