Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: Both Debate Agent ls08 and Debate Agent z92Y independently concluded that the number of distinct valid maximal placements is 900. This result comes from summing over all pairs (b_r, b_c) where b_r and b_c range from 1 to 4, the product of binomial coefficients C(5, b_r) * C(5, b_c). The sum of C(5, k) for k=1 to 4 is 30, so the total count is 30 * 30 = 900. This count respects the conditions of the problem: each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and column have the same color, and the placement is maximal (no additional chips can be added without violating the conditions). The chips of the same color are indistinguishable, so only the choice of which rows and columns are black matters, and placements differing by color assignments to rows and columns are distinct. Therefore, the final count of distinct valid maximal placements is 900.

proposed answer: The count of distinct valid maximal placements corresponds to the number of pairs (b_r, b_c) where b_r and b_c range from 0 to 5 inclusive. Each pair uniquely determines a maximal placement: black chips occupy the intersections of the b_r black rows and b_c black columns, and white chips occupy the intersections of the remaining rows and columns. This ensures maximality because all possible positions for black and white chips under the uniform color constraints are filled, so no additional chip can be added without violating the conditions. Placements differing only by color assignments to rows and columns are considered distinct, so no further symmetry reductions apply. Edge cases such as the fully black grid (b_r=5, b_c=5) and fully white grid (b_r=0, b_c=0) are included and valid. Therefore, the total number of distinct valid maximal placements is 6 Ã— 6 = 36.
