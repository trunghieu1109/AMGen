Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We need to compute 2 * Σ_{k=0}^5 [C(5,k)·C(5,5−k)]. Note that C(5,5−k)=C(5,k). So the sum Σ_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)^2. A known identity is Σ_{k=0}^n C(n,k)^2 = C(2n,n). Here n=5, so Σ_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)^2 = C(10,5) = 252. Multiplying by 2 (for the two choices of main chip colour) gives 2·252 = 504.

proposed answer: We need to compute S = 2 * \sum_{k=0}^5 \Bigl( C(5,k) * C(5,5-k) \Bigr). But C(5,5-k)=C(5,k), so inside the sum is C(5,k)^2. Hence

Sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)^2 = C(5,0)^2 + C(5,1)^2 + C(5,2)^2 + C(5,3)^2 + C(5,4)^2 + C(5,5)^2
= 1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2
= 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252.

Therefore the final result is 2 * 252 = 504.
