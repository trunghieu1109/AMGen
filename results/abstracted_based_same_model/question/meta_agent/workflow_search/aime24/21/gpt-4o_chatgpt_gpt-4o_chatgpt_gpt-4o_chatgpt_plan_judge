Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To count the number of valid rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the conditions for forming rectangles. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, and we can form rectangles by choosing 4 vertices such that opposite sides are equal and adjacent sides are perpendicular. In a regular dodecagon, the vertices are evenly spaced around a circle, and the diagonals and sides can be used to form rectangles. The symmetry of the dodecagon allows us to systematically count the rectangles. We can choose any vertex as a starting point and then select the opposite vertex to form one pair of opposite sides. The remaining two vertices must be chosen such that they form the other pair of opposite sides, ensuring perpendicularity. By considering all possible combinations and using the symmetry of the dodecagon, we can determine the total number of rectangles. After verifying the conditions for rectangles and considering the symmetry, the total number of valid rectangles is 27.

proposed answer: To count the number of unique rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices and 12 sides. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 diameters (lines connecting opposite vertices) that can serve as diagonals of rectangles. For each pair of diameters, a rectangle can be formed. The number of ways to choose 2 diameters from 6 is given by the combination formula C(6, 2). Therefore, the number of unique rectangles is C(6, 2) = 15.
