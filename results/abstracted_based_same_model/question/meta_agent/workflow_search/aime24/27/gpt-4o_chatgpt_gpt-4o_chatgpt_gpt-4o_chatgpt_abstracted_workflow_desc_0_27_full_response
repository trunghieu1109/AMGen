A four-digit number N can be expressed as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, and d are its digits. When we change one of its digits to 1, we get a new number. For each digit position, we need to check the divisibility by 7 when that digit is replaced by 1. For the thousands digit, the new number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. For the hundreds digit, the new number is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. For the tens digit, the new number is 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. For the units digit, the new number is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Therefore, N + (1 - a) * 1000, N + (1 - b) * 100, N + (1 - c) * 10, and N + (1 - d) must be divisible by 7.
