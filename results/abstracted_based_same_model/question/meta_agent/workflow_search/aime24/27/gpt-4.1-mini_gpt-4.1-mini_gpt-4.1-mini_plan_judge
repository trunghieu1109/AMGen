Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_7_27
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have the quotient Q = 5 and the remainder R = 694 when the number N = 5694 is divided by 1000. The problem asks for the sum Q + R. Adding these values, we get 5 + 694 = 699. This sum is the final answer required by the problem.

Answer:699
