Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_27
proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we have determined that the quotient Q when N is divided by 1000 is 9, and the remainder R is 961. To find the sum Q + R, we simply add these two values together: Q + R = 9 + 961 = 970. Therefore, the sum Q + R is 970.
