Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_26
proposed answer: The set A from Sub-task 5 is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. Summing these: 4+6=10, 10+7=17, 17+8=25, 25+9=34, 34+10=44, 44+11=55. Thus the sum of the elements of A is 55.

Answer:55
Extracted answer: 55
Correct answer: 055
