Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: From subtask_2, we determined that the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 7. Therefore, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 7^2 = 49. In subtask_2, it was found that n = 5 satisfies this condition because 5^4 = 625 and 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 49. Thus, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 49 is m = 5.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we determined that the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 5. In sub-task 3, it was verified that the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 is m = 7. This was confirmed by checking that 7^4 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25 (since 2402 mod 25 = 0). Therefore, the least positive integer m is 7.
