proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we found that the least prime p for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 17. We then looked for solutions of m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17^2 (289). First we solved m^4 ≡ −1 ≡ 16 mod 17, yielding two initial roots m ≡ 2 and m ≡ 15 mod 17. Since f'(m) = 4m^3 is not divisible by 17 at these roots, each lifts uniquely via Hensel’s lemma to a solution mod 289: for m₀ = 2 the lift is 155, and for m₀ = 15 the lift is 134. Among these, the smallest positive integer solution is m = 134.

proposed answer: We identified that p=17 is the smallest prime dividing n^4+1 with p^2 dividing for some n, and found the initial root r=2 modulo 17 since 2^4+1=17≡0 mod17. Using Hensel’s lemma to lift to mod17^2=289, we set m=r+17k and solved f(r)+17k·f'(r)≡0 mod289. Here f(r)=17=1·17 and f'(r)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod17, so we need 1+15k≡0 mod17 giving k≡9. Thus m=2+9·17=155, the least positive lift with 155^4+1 divisible by289.
