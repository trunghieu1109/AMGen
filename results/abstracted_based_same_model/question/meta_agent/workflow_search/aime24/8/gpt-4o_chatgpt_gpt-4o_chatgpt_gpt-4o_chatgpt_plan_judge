Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The losing positions for Bob are those where Alice can guarantee a win. From the analysis provided, these positions are of the form 5k + 1. To find the number of such positions for n less than or equal to 2024, we solve the inequality 5k + 1 <= 2024. This simplifies to k <= 404. Since k is an integer, it can take values from 0 to 404 inclusive. This results in 405 possible values for k, each corresponding to a losing position for Bob. Therefore, the count of losing positions for Bob is 405.

proposed answer: Both agents have correctly identified that the losing positions for Bob are those where n is of the form 4k + 1. This is because in these positions, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a winning position. To count the number of such positions up to n = 2024, we consider the arithmetic sequence 1, 5, 9, ..., 2021. The first term is 1, the common difference is 4, and the last term is 2021. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, a_n = a + (n-1)d, we set a_n = 2021 and solve for n: 2021 = 1 + (n-1)4, which simplifies to 2020 = 4(n-1), giving n-1 = 505, thus n = 506. Therefore, there are 506 numbers of the form 4k + 1 up to 2024, which are the losing positions for Bob. Both agents agree on this count, and the reasoning is consistent and correct.
