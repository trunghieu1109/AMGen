Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid with exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 5 segments alternating between horizontal and vertical moves. The total horizontal steps sum to 8, and the total vertical steps sum to 8. There are two cases: starting with a horizontal segment or starting with a vertical segment. For the first case, there are 3 horizontal segments and 2 vertical segments. The number of positive integer solutions for the horizontal segments is C(7,2) = 21, and for the vertical segments is C(7,1) = 7, giving 21*7=147 solutions. For the second case, starting with a vertical segment, the counts are symmetric, also yielding 147 solutions. Adding both cases gives 147 + 147 = 294. This matches the previously obtained result and is consistent with the problem constraints and example paths. Therefore, the total number of such paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
