Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 3 we counted paths of length 16 on the 8×8 grid that start with E and have exactly 4 turns: they consist of 5 runs (3 E-runs summing to 8 and 2 N-runs summing to 8), giving 21⋅7 = 147 such paths. But in fact a path with 4 turns may start either East or North. By symmetry, the number of such paths starting North is the same 147. Hence the total number of paths with exactly 4 turns is 2⋅147 = 294.
