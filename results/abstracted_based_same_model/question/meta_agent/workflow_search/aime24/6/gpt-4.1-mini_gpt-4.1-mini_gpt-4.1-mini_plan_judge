Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the maximum squared diagonal length of the rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23 is found to be 329/8. The radius r of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the diagonal length, so r^2 is one quarter of the squared diagonal length. Therefore, r^2 = (1/4) * (329/8) = 329/32. The fraction 329/32 is already in lowest terms since 329 and 32 share no common factors other than 1. Hence, p = 329 and q = 32, and p + q = 329 + 32 = 361.

proposed answer: The radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is half the length of the box's space diagonal. The squared diagonal length D_max is given as 13. Therefore, r^2 = (D_max) / 4 = 13 / 4. The fraction 13/4 is already in lowest terms since 13 and 4 share no common factors other than 1. Hence, p = 13 and q = 4, and p + q = 17.
