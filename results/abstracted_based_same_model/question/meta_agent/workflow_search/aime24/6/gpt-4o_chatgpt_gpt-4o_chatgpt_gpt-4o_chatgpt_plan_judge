Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_6
proposed answer: Both agents agree that the expression for r^2 is \( \frac{2709}{64} \), and they have verified that 2709 and 64 are relatively prime, meaning the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, p = 2709 and q = 64. The task is to compute the sum p + q, which is 2709 + 64. Both agents have calculated this sum to be 2773. Since their reasoning is consistent and correct, the final decision on the sum p + q is 2773.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_6
proposed answer: Both agents agree that the expression for r^2 is \( \frac{47}{4} \), where p = 47 and q = 4. These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of p and q, which is 47 + 4. Both agents calculated this sum to be 51. Therefore, the final decision on the sum p + q is 51.
