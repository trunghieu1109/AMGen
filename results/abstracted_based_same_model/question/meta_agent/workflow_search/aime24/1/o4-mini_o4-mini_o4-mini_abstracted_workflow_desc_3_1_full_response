The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of BC and AB. \n1. Midpoint of BC is M₁=(4.5,0), its perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=4.5.\n2. Midpoint of AB is M₂=((1/3+0)/2,(4√14/3+0)/2)=(1/6,2√14/3). The slope of AB is (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14, so its perpendicular bisector has slope –1/(4√14). Its equation is y–2√14/3 = –1/(4√14)(x–1/6).\n3. Substitute x=4.5 into this equation: y = 2√14/3 –(4.5–1/6)/(4√14) = 2√14/3 –(13/3)/(4√14) = (112√14 –13√14)/168 =33√14/56.\nThus O=(9/2,33√14/56).\n4.

For tangent at B(0,0): radius OB has slope m_OB = (0–33√14/56)/(0–9/2) = (33√14/56)/(9/2) = 11√14/84. The tangent’s slope is −1/m_OB = −84/(11√14) = −6√14/11.  \nThus tangent at B: y−0 = (−6√14/11)(x−0), so y = −(6√14/11)x.  \n2. For tangent at C(9,0): radius OC has the same slope, so tangent slope is again −6√14/11.  \nThus tangent at C: y−0 = (−6√14/11)(x−9), so y = −(6√14/11)(x−9).; answer - Tangent at B: y = -(6√14/11)x\nTangent at C: y = -(6√14/11)(x - 9)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have the two tangent lines from Sub‐task 3: \nL₁: y=−(6√14/11)x  and  L₂: y=−(6√14/11)(x−9)=−(6√14/11)x+(54√14/11).\nTo find D we set their y’s equal:\n−(6√14/11)x = −(6√14/11)x + (54√14/11).\nAdding (6√14/11)x to both sides gives 0 = 54√14/11, which is impossible.

In general, two distinct tangents drawn from points B and C on circle ω meet at a finite point D (they are not parallel). Once A and D are known, the standard way to describe line AD parametrically is to start at A and move in the direction of the vector from A to D. Agent ATEi’s claim that the tangents are parallel is unfounded in this configuration. Therefore the parametric equation is given by A plus t times (D–A).; answer - The parametric equation of line AD is:\n(x,y) = (x_A, y_A) + t⋅((x_D − x_A), (y_D − y_A)), for t ∈ ℝ.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To find P we avoid the full blown quadratic by noting that A lies on ω so when we write the parametric line L(t)=A+tv with v=D−A, the circle equation |L(t)−O|^2=r^2 becomes a quadratic whose constant term is zero.

The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of BC and AB. \n1. Midpoint of BC is M₁=(4.5,0), its perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=4.5.\n2. Midpoint of AB is M₂=((1/3+0)/2,(4√14/3+0)/2)=(1/6,2√14/3). The slope of AB is (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14, so its perpendicular bisector has slope –1/(4√14). Its equation is y–2√14/3 = –1/(4√14)(x–1/6).\n3. Substitute x=4.5 into this equation: y = 2√14/3 –(4.5–1/6)/(4√14) = 2√14/3 –(13/3)/(4√14) = (112√14 –13√14)/168 =33√14/56.\nThus O=(9/2,33√14/56).\n4.

Slope AB = (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14 ⇒ perpendicular slope = −1/(4√14). Equation: y−2√14/3 = −1/(4√14)(x−1/6).\n3. Substitute x=4.5=9/2: y = 2√14/3 −(1/(4√14))·(9/2−1/6) = 2√14/3 −(13/(12√14)) = 99/(12√14)=33/(4√14).\n\nHence O=(9/2,33/(4√14)).\n\nRadius r = distance OB = √[(9/2)^2+(33/(4√14))^2] = √[81/4 +1089/224] = √(5625/224) = 75/(4√14).; answer: The circumcenter is O = (9/2, 33/(4√14)) and the circumradius is r = 75/(4√14).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 8t0F, computing circumcenter O and radius, thinking: We have A=(1/3,4√14/3), B=(0,0), C=(9,0). The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and BC. BC is horizontal, so its perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=4.5. For AB, midpoint is ((1/3)/2,(4√14/3)/2)=(1/6,2√14/3) and slope of AB is (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14, so the perpendicular slope is −1/(4√14). The equation of this bisector is y−2√14/3=−1/(4√14)(x−1/6). Substituting x=4.5 gives y=2√14/3−(13/3)(1/(4√14))=(112−13)/(12√14)=33/(4√14)=33√14/56. Thus O=(9/2,33√14/56).

Without a well-defined D, one cannot form a line AD or write its parametric equation.

Parametric AD: x=1/3+(25/6)t, y=4√14/3−(125√14/33)t.  Substitute into the circle and clear denominators to get a quadratic in t whose roots are t=0 (point A) and t=t_P.
