Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: Both agents have determined that the length of segment AP is 9/2, where 9 and 2 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, m = 9 and n = 2. The sum m + n is calculated as 9 + 2 = 11. Both agents agree on this calculation, and there is no conflicting information. Thus, the final decision on the sum m + n is 11.

proposed answer: The sub-task question asks for the sum m + n, where AP is expressed as a fraction m/n with m and n being relatively prime integers. From the related sub-task answers, AP was calculated to be 25/3, which means m = 25 and n = 3. Since 25 and 3 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum m + n is 25 + 3 = 28. Both agents agree on this result, confirming its correctness.
