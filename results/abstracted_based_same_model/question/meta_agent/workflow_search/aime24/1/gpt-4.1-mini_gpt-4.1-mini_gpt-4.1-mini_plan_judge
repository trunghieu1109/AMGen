Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: Given the triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, we place B at (0,0) and C at (9,0) on the coordinate plane. Using the distance formulas, point A is found at (4,3). The circumcircle ω passes through A, B, and C. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at D, and the line AD intersects ω again at P. By calculating the coordinates of D and the equation of line AD, and then finding the second intersection point P of line AD with the circle, the length AP is computed. The length AP simplifies to 36/7, which is in lowest terms. Therefore, m=36 and n=7, and the sum m+n=43.

proposed answer: The length AP can be found using the tangent-secant theorem or power of point theorem. Given triangle ABC inscribed in circle ω, with tangents at B and C intersecting at D, and AD intersecting ω again at P, the length AP satisfies AP = (AB * AC) / BC. Substituting the given lengths AB=5, AC=10, and BC=9, we get AP = (5 * 10) / 9 = 50/9. This fraction is in lowest terms since 50 and 9 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m=50 and n=9, and the sum m+n=59. This result is consistent with the geometric configuration and the power of point theorem, confirming its correctness.
