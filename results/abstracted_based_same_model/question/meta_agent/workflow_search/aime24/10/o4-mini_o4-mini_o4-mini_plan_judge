Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_10
proposed answer: From Sub-task 6 we have E_x = 15 and C_x = 16. The distance CE is the absolute difference of their x-coordinates: |16 – 15| = 1.

Answer:1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_10
proposed answer: Sub-task 7 found no valid real root for E_x in [0,16], so E_x is undefined. Sub-task 9 concluded CE1=|C_x–E_x| cannot be evaluated and remains undefined. Sub-task 11 confirmed CE1 and CE2 both undefined and consistent. Therefore there is no integer value for CE1 to return.

Answer:CE1 is undefined
Extracted answer: CE1 is undefined
Correct answer: 104
