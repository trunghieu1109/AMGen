proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we have derived that the product xy equals 25. This result comes from manipulating the given logarithmic equations and using the properties of logarithms. Both x and y are greater than 1, and the equations log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 lead to the conclusion that xy = 25. This value satisfies the original equations and the constraints on x and y. Therefore, the integer value of xy as the final answer is 25.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, the approximate values of x and y are x ≈ 1.536 and y ≈ 16.27. Multiplying these gives xy ≈ 1.536 * 16.27 ≈ 25. The verification showed that these values satisfy the original logarithmic equations closely and meet the domain conditions x > 1 and y > 1. Since the problem asks for the integer value of the product xy, the closest integer to the product is 25. Therefore, the final answer is 25.
