proposed answer: We have determined that x = 25/2 and y = (25/2)^{4/5}. To find the product xy, we multiply these two expressions: xy = (25/2) * (25/2)^{4/5}. We can simplify this by using the property of exponents: a^m * a^n = a^(m+n). Here, we have (25/2)^(1) * (25/2)^(4/5) = (25/2)^(1 + 4/5) = (25/2)^(9/5).

Answer:The product xy is (25/2)^(9/5).
Extracted answer: The product xy is (25/2)^(9/5).
Correct answer: 025

proposed answer: We have determined the values of x and y as x = \frac{5}{2} and y = \frac{625}{16}. To find the product xy, we simply multiply these two values together. The calculation is as follows: xy = \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{625}{16}. To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators: xy = \frac{5 \times 625}{2 \times 16} = \frac{3125}{32}. Therefore, the product xy is \frac{3125}{32}.

Answer:xy = \frac{3125}{32}
Extracted answer: xy = \frac{3125}{32}
Correct answer: 025
