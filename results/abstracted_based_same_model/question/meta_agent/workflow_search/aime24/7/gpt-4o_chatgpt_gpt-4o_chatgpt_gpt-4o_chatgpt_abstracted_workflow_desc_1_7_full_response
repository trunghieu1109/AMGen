The exponent simplifies to \\frac{5}{2x}, so we have x = x^{\\frac{5}{2x}}. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get \\log(x) = \\frac{5}{2x} \\log(x). If \\log(x) is not zero, we can divide both sides by \\log(x) to get 1 = \\frac{5}{2x}, which implies x = \\frac{5}{2}. Therefore, the relationship between x and y is that x = \\frac{5}{2}.
