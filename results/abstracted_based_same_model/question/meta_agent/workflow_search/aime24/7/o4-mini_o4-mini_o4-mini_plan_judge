Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: From the system derived in Sub-task 3 we have two expressions for ln y: (10 ln x)/x and (2y ln x)/5. Equating them gives 10/x = 2y/5 â‡’ xy = 25. Hence regardless of the individual values of x and y satisfying the logs, their product is always 25.

proposed answer: Starting from the relation 10/x = 2y/5, multiply both sides by x to get 10 = (2xy)/5. Then multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2xy. Finally, divide by 2 to find xy = 25.
