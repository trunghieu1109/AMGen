Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9, and an even-length list so that the median is the average of two middle terms and is an integer not in the list. 9 must appear at least twice and more often than any other number.  Trying length 4: let the list be [a,b,c,d], with two entries equal to 9.  Then a + b + 9 + 9 = 30 ⇒ a + b = 12.  To make (b+c)/2 an integer not in the list, set b = 7, c = 9, so a = 5.  This yields [5,7,9,9], median = (7+9)/2 = 8 (not in list), unique mode = 9, sum = 30.  No longer list can meet all conditions without tying frequencies or including the median value.  Thus the only valid list is [5,7,9,9], and its sum of squares is 5² + 7² + 9² + 9² = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
