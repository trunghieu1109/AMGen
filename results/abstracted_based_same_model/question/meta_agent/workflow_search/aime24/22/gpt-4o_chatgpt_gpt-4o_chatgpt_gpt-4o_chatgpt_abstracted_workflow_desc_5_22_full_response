The sum of the list is 30, and the unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. The median is a positive integer not in the list. Let's consider the constraints: 1. The sum of the list is 30. 2. The mode is 9, so 9 appears at least twice. 3. The median is not in the list, so n must be odd (since if n is even, the median would be the average of two numbers in the list). 4. The median is a positive integer, so it must be at least 1.

For k = 2, the sum of the other elements must be 30 - 18 = 12. If n = 5, the list could be [9, 9, a, b, c] with a + b + c = 12. The median is the third element, which cannot be 9 or any of a, b, c.

For (k, n) = (2, 5), we have two 9s and three other numbers summing to 12. The list is [9, 9, a, b, c] with a + b + c = 12. The median is the third element, which cannot be 9 or any of a, b, c. For (k, n) = (3, 7), we have three 9s and four other numbers summing to 3. The list is [9, 9, 9, a, b, c, d] with a + b + c + d = 3. The median is the fourth element, which cannot be 9 or any of a, b, c, d. Let's analyze each case:\n\nFor (k, n) = (2, 5):\n- The list is [9, 9, a, b, c] with a + b + c = 12. The median is the third element, which cannot be 9 or any of a, b, c.

The median must be a number not in the list, so we need to check each partition.\n\nFor (k, n) = (3, 7):\n- The list is [9, 9, 9, a, b, c, d] with a + b + c + d = 3. The median is the fourth element, which cannot be 9 or any of a, b, c, d. Possible partitions of 3 into 4 positive integers are limited. The only partition is (1, 1, 1, 0), but 0 is not allowed, so this case is impossible.\n\nThus, we focus on (k, n) = (2, 5) and check each partition for a valid median. For example, with (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 10), the list is [9, 9, 1, 1, 10]. The median is 1, which is in the list, so this partition is invalid. Continuing this process, we find that the partition (3, 4, 5) gives the list [9, 9, 3, 4, 5] with a median of 4, which is not in the list, making it valid.
