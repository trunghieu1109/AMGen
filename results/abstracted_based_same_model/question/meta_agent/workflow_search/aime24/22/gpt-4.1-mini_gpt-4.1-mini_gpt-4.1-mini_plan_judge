Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: Sub-task 5 concluded that no valid list satisfies all the given conditions simultaneously: sum of 30, unique mode 9, and median a positive integer not in the list. Since no valid list exists, there are no items to square and sum. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the valid list(s) is undefined or zero by default as no such list exists.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the valid list identified is [5,7,9,9]. To find the sum of the squares of all items in this list, we calculate 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This list satisfies all the given conditions, so the sum of squares for this valid list is 236.
