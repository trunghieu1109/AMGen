proposed answer: We have r=6 and semiperimeter s=4√30+2√39 from Sub-task 7, so the area Δ=r·s=6(4√30+2√39)=24√30+12√39.  By the law of sines area formula Δ=½·(BC·CA)·sinA, and since sinA=2√30/13, we get BC·CA=2Δ/sinA.  Substituting gives BC·CA=2(24√30+12√39)/(2√30/13) which simplifies to 312+156√(13/10), identical to 156(2√30+√39)/√30.  Hence the final product is 312+156√(13/10).

proposed answer: We know Δ = rs = 6·( (a+b+c)/2 ) and from earlier work Δ = 36√30, and sin A = 2√30/13. By the area formula Δ = ½·b·c·sin A, we solve for b·c: b·c = 2Δ/sin A = 2·(36√30)/(2√30/13) = 72√30·(13/(2√30)) = 36·13 = 468.
