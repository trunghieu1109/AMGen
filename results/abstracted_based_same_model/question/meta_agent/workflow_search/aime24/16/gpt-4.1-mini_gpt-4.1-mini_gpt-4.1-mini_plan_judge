Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_16
proposed answer: Both detailed reasonings from the debate agents agree on the final numeric value of AB * AC as 156. They use the relation AB * AC = 4R^2 sin B sin C, and from the given conditions and Euler's formula, they derive sin B sin C = r/(2R) = 3/13. Substituting R=13 and r=6, the product AB * AC calculates to 156. The consistency and correctness of the geometric relations and substitutions confirm that 156 is the correct and final answer.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_16
proposed answer: Both Debate Agent fGTJ and Debate Agent Lqjr independently derived the value of AB * AC as 240 using consistent geometric relations and the given parameters: circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6, and s - a = 10. They used the Law of Sines, area formulas, and the perpendicularity condition IA âŸ‚ OI to verify the correctness of this value. Since both agents agree and the value satisfies all the given conditions and constraints, the numeric value of AB * AC is confidently 240.
