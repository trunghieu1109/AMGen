Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We showed that every b-beautiful integer corresponds to an odd m whose square is 0 mod (b–1) and whose digits in base b sum to m.  In fact one proves the count of solutions is 2^{k–1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of b–1.  To exceed ten we need 2^{k-1}>10 ⇒ 2^k>20 ⇒ k≥5.  The smallest integer with 5 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7·11=2310, so b–1=2310 ⇒ b=2311.  Any smaller b–1 has at most 4 prime factors, yielding at most 2^3=8 beautiful numbers (≤10).  Hence the least base is 2311.

proposed answer: We have count_b = b – ⌈√b⌉, and we seek the smallest integer b ≥ 2 for which count_b > 10, i.e.
b – ⌈√b⌉ ≥ 11 ⇒ b ≥ 11 + ⌈√b⌉. Let k = ⌈√b⌉, so (k–1)² < b ≤ k². We need b ≥ k+11 and b ≤ k². Thus k+11 ≤ k² ⇒ k² – k – 11 ≥ 0.
Solve k² – k – 11 = 0 ⇒ k = [1 + √(1+44)]/2 = [1+√45]/2 ≈ (1+6.708)/2 ≈ 3.854 ⇒ k ≥ 4.
For k = 4: b ≥ 4+11 = 15 and b ≤ 16. The smallest such b in ( (k–1)², k² ] = (9,16] is b = 15. Check: ⌈√15⌉ = 4 ⇒ count_15 = 15 – 4 = 11 > 10. No smaller b works. Hence the answer is 15.

proposed answer: We need the smallest base b≥2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers.  A b-beautiful integer n=s² must be two‐digit in base b, so b≤s²<b², and its digits x,y satisfy x+y=s where n=xb+y.  This forces s(s−1)≡0 mod(b−1).  Writing m=b−1, the number of solutions s mod m to s(s−1)≡0 is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct primes dividing m, since for each prime power factor p^e of m we have two residue classes (0 or 1).  In the interval s=⌈√b⌉…b−1 these solutions drop only s=1 if below ⌈√b⌉, so the count is still essentially 2^{ω(m)}−1.  To exceed 10 we need 2^{ω(m)}>10, so ω(m)≥4.  The smallest m with four distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, giving b=m+1=211.  No smaller b−1 has four distinct primes, so the least base is 211.
