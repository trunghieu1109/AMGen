Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent OaDC', content='We need the smallest base b≥2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers.  A b-beautiful integer n=s² must be two‐digit in base b, so b≤s²<b², and its digits x,y satisfy x+y=s where n=xb+y.  This forces s(s−1)≡0 mod(b−1).  Writing m=b−1, the number of solutions s mod m to s(s−1)≡0 is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct primes dividing m, since for each prime power factor p^e of m we have two residue classes (0 or 1).  In the interval s=⌈√b⌉…b−1 these solutions drop only s=1 if below ⌈√b⌉, so the count is still essentially 2^{ω(m)}−1.  To exceed 10 we need 2^{ω(m)}>10, so ω(m)≥4.  The smallest m with four distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, giving b=m+1=211.  No smaller b−1 has four distinct primes, so the least base is 211.\n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

From Sub-task 3 the count equals the number of integers s with ⌈√b⌉≤s≤b−1 satisfying (b−1)∣s(s−1).  Writing m=b−1 and factoring m, for each prime factor p the congruence p^e∣s(s−1) has exactly two solutions mod p^e, so altogether there are 2^{ω(m)} solutions mod m, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime divisors of m.  As s ranges through nearly one full residue system mod m, the count ≈2^{ω(m)}.  To exceed 10 one needs 2^{ω(m)}>10, i.e. ω(m)≥4.  The smallest m with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, giving b=m+1=211.  Hence b=211 is the least base with more than ten b–beautiful integers.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent bsUb:\nWe want the smallest base b≥2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful n must be a two‐digit square in base b: n=s² with b≤n<b², and digits x,y satisfy x+y=s. Writing n=x·b+y gives x(b−1)=s(s−1), so s(s−1)≡0 mod(b−1) and s ranges from ⌈√b⌉ to b−1. The number of solutions s in [1,b−1] of s(s−1)≡0 mod m (where m=b−1) equals 2^r, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of m (because s≡0 or 1 mod each prime-power divisor). In the interval [⌈√b⌉,b−1], exactly one of the 2^r solutions (namely s=1) is excluded and the class s≡0 gives s=b−1 which is ≥⌈√b⌉; any other small residues below ⌈√b⌉ can also be excluded, but for m=2·3·5·7=210 the only residue <⌈√211⌉=15 is s=1. Thus for b−1=210 (b=211), the count is 2^4−1=16−1=15, which exceeds 10. No smaller m has four distinct prime factors, so 211 is minimal.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent qbe9:\n211\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent bsUb:\n211\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Decide the smallest base b from proposed candidates.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

Since n< b^2, we have s< b, and n≥b (two digits) gives s^2 ≥ b so s ≥ ⌈√b⌉.  Hence s ranges over all integers from ⌈√b⌉ to b−1.  For each such s we test every possible leading digit x (1≤x≤b−1) by setting y = s−x and checking that 0≤y≤b−1 and that s^2 = x·b + y.  Whenever these conditions hold, n = s^2 is a valid b-beautiful integer with base-b digits x and y summing to s.  This brute-force enumeration finds exactly all b-beautiful n, and each n so produced clearly meets the definition (two digits in base b and digit sum = √n).; answer: To enumerate all b-beautiful integers for a fixed base b≥2:\n1.
