Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_18
proposed answer: From prior work we determined that OC^2=7/16. The numerator p=7 and denominator q=16 are relatively prime. Therefore p+q=7+16=23.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_18
proposed answer: From the prior result we have OCÂ² = 7/16, which is in lowest terms with p = 7 and q = 16. Therefore p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.
