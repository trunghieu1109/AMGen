Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the point C is the midpoint of segment AB with coordinates (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). The squared distance from O=(0,0) to C is OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This fraction is already in lowest terms with p=1 and q=4. Therefore, the sum p+q = 1+4 = 5.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the point C on segment AB corresponds to the parameter t = 3/4. Using this, the coordinates of C are C_x = 1/8 and C_y = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Calculating OC^2 = C_x^2 + C_y^2 = (1/8)^2 + ((3 sqrt(3))/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. The fraction 7/16 is already in lowest terms since 7 and 16 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, p = 7 and q = 16, and the sum p + q = 23. This matches the previously computed result, confirming the correctness.
