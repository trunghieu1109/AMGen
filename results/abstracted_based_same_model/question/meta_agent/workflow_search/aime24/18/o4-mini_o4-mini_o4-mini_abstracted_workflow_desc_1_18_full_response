Any such P and Q satisfy P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x>0,y>0 and distance PQ=√(x²+y²)=1. Thus (x,y) lies on the quarter–circle x²+y²=1 in the first quadrant.

The envelope must satisfy both f=0 and ∂f/∂θ=0.  First, compute ∂f/∂θ:  ∂/∂θ[x/(cos θ)] = x·sin θ/(cos^2 θ) = x·sec θ·tan θ, and ∂/∂θ[y/(sin θ)] = –y·cos θ/(sin^2 θ) = –y·csc θ·cot θ.  Thus ∂f/∂θ = x·sin θ/(cos^2 θ) – y·cos θ/(sin^2 θ) = 0, implying x·sin^3 θ = y·cos^3 θ, or y = x·(sin^3 θ/ cos^3 θ).  Substitute this into f=0:  x/(cos θ) + [x·(sin^3 θ/ cos^3 θ)]/(sin θ) – 1 = 0  ⇒  x/(cos θ) + x·(sin^2 θ/ cos^3 θ) = 1  ⇒  x·(cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ)/cos^3 θ = 1  ⇒  x = cos^3 θ.  Then y = (cos^3 θ)·(sin^3 θ/cos^3 θ) = sin^3 θ.  Hence the envelope curve is parameterized by θ as E(θ) = (cos^3 θ, sin^3 θ), for θ in (0, π/2).; answer - E(θ) = (cos^3 θ, sin^3 θ) for θ in (0, π/2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To parameterize AB from A=(1/2,0) to B=(0,√3/2), use a linear interpolation: C(s)=A + s(B−A).

Compute f′(s)=−(1/3)((1−s)/2)^{−1/3}+(√3/3)((√3\u2009s)/2)^{−1/3}. Setting f′(s)=0 gives (1−s)^{-1/3}=√3·(√3\u2009s)^{-1/3}, which simplifies to 6/(s)=2/(1−s) ⇒ s=3/4.

A line intercepting the x‐axis at (a,0) and the y‐axis at (0,b) has equation x/a + y/b = 1. Here P and Q themselves give the intercepts: a = cosθ and b = sinθ. Substituting these into the intercept form yields x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1. One can also verify by deriving the slope: slope m = (sinθ−0)/(0−cosθ) = −tanθ, so the point–slope form y − 0 = (−tanθ)(x − cosθ) rearranges directly to the same intercept equation.; answer: x/(cos θ) + y/(sin θ) = 1\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yOtZ, deriving line equation, thinking: To find the line through P=(cosθ,0) and Q=(0,sinθ), compute its slope: m=(sinθ−0)/(0−cosθ)=−tanθ.

In particular it misses any corner or cusp that might arise at the endpoints of the family, and it does not address what happens when cosθ or sinθ vanishes. These hidden regularity and domain restrictions limit the applicability of the formula E(θ)=(cos³θ,sin³θ).; correct: The envelope derivation is limited to the open interval θ∈(0,π/2) and smooth portions of the envelope; it fails at the boundary values θ=0 or π/2, ignores potential non-uniqueness of θ for a given point, and assumes differentiability (so it does not capture corners or cusp points).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 7Iy3, refining envelope, thinking: We seek the envelope of the one‐parameter family of lines f(x,y,θ)= x/(cos θ) + y/(sin θ) – 1 = 0.  The envelope must satisfy both f=0 and ∂f/∂θ=0.  First, compute ∂f/∂θ:  ∂/∂θ[x/(cos θ)] = x·sin θ/(cos^2 θ) = x·sec θ·tan θ, and ∂/∂θ[y/(sin θ)] = –y·cos θ/(sin^2 θ) = –y·csc θ·cot θ.  Thus ∂f/∂θ = x·sin θ/(cos^2 θ) – y·cos θ/(sin^2 θ) = 0, implying x·sin^3 θ = y·cos^3 θ, or y = x·(sin^3 θ/ cos^3 θ).  Substitute this into f=0:  x/(cos θ) + [x·(sin^3 θ/ cos^3 θ)]/(sin θ) – 1 = 0  ⇒  x/(cos θ) + x·(sin^2 θ/ cos^3 θ) = 1  ⇒  x·(cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ)/cos^3 θ = 1  ⇒  x = cos^3 θ.
