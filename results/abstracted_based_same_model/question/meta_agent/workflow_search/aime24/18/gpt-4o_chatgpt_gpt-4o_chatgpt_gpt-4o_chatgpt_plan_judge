Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: From sub-task 7, we have determined that OC^2 is expressed as the fraction 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of p and q, which is simply 1 + 4.

proposed answer: From sub-task 9, we found that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. These are relatively prime positive integers. To find the sum p + q, we simply add these two integers together: 1 + 4 = 5.
