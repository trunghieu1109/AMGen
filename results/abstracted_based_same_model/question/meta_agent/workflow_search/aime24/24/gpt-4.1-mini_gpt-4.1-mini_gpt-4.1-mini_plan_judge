Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the simplified fraction for |log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the fraction is in simplest form. The problem asks for the sum m + n, where m = 25 and n = 8. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

proposed answer: The recomputation correctly transforms the logarithmic equations into a linear system by setting a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). The system is solved step-by-step: summing all three equations to find a + b + c, then substituting back to find individual values of a, b, and c. The final expression 4a + 3b + 2c is computed accurately, and its absolute value is found to be 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the sum m + n = 33 is correct. This matches the previous solution, confirming the accuracy of the entire calculation.
