Thus, A + C = -17/24. Substitute back into B = A + C + 1/3 to get B = -17/24 + 1/3 = -17/24 + 8/24 = -9/24 = -3/8. Therefore, log_2(y) = B = -3/8.; answer: log_2(y) = -\\frac{3}{8}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent OmrG, solving for log_2(z), thinking: From the verified linear system: A - B - C = 1/2, B - A - C = 1/3, C - A - B = 1/4 and the derived relation A + B + C = -13/12, we want to isolate and solve for C = log_2(z). Using the derived relation, we can express C = -13/12 - A - B. Substitute C into the first equation: A - B - (-13/12 - A - B) = 1/2, which simplifies to 2A = 1/2 - 13/12 = -7/12, so A = -7/24. Similarly, substitute C into the second equation: B - A - (-13/12 - A - B) = 1/3, which simplifies to 2B = 1/3 - 13/12 = -7/12, so B = -7/24. Now, C = -13/12 - A - B = -13/12 + 7/24 + 7/24 = -13/12 + 14/24 = -13/12 + 7/12 = -6/12 = -1/2. Therefore, log_2(z) = C = -1/2.; answer: log_2(z) = -1/2\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent kgiE, solving for log_2(x), thinking: From the verified linear system: A - B - C = 1/2, B - A - C = 1/3, C - A - B = 1/4, where A = log_2(x), B = log_2(y), C = log_2(z), we want to solve for A. Adding all three equations gives A + B + C = -13/12. Using this, we can substitute B and C in terms of A or solve the system simultaneously. Adding the first two equations: (A - B - C) + (B - A - C) = 1/2 + 1/3 => -2C = 5/6 => C = -5/12. Using C = -5/12 in the third equation: C - A - B = 1/4 => -5/12 - A - B = 1/4 => -A - B = 1/4 + 5/12 = 8/12 + 5/12 = 13/12 => A + B = -13/12. From the sum A + B + C = -13/12 and C = -5/12, A + B = -13/12 - C = -13/12 + 5/12 = -8/12 = -2/3, which contradicts the previous result A + B = -13/12. Re-examining the calculation, the sum A + B + C = -13/12 is correct. From the third equation, C - A - B = 1/4 => C = 1/4 + A + B. Substituting into the sum: A + B + (1/4 + A + B) = -13/12 => 2A + 2B + 1/4 = -13/12 => 2A + 2B = -13/12 - 1/4 = -13/12 - 3/12 = -16/12 = -4/3 => A + B = -2/3. Now from the first equation: A - B - C = 1/2. Using C = 1/4 + A + B, substitute: A - B - (1/4 + A + B) = 1/2 => A - B - 1/4 - A - B = 1/2 => -2B - 1/4 = 1/2 => -2B = 3/4 => B = -3/8. Since A + B = -2/3, A = -2/3 - B = -2/3 + 3/8 = (-16/24 + 9/24) = -7/24. Therefore, log_2(x) = A = -7/24.; answer: log_2(x) = -\\frac{7}{24}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent mChX, solving for log_2(y), thinking: From the verified linear system: \nA - B - C = 1/2  (1)\nB - A - C = 1/3  (2)\nC - A - B = 1/4  (3)\nwhere A = log_2(x), B = log_2(y), C = log_2(z).\n\nFrom (1): A - B - C = 1/2\nFrom (2): B - A - C = 1/3\nAdd (1) and (2): (A - B - C) + (B - A - C) = 1/2 + 1/3\nSimplifies to: -2C = 5/6\nSo, C = -5/12.\n\nUsing (1): A - B - (-5/12) = 1/2 => A - B + 5/12 = 1/2 => A - B = 1/2 - 5/12 = (6/12 - 5/12) = 1/12.\n\nUsing (3): C - A - B = 1/4 => -5/12 - A - B = 1/4 => - A - B = 1/4 + 5/12 = (3/12 + 5/12) = 8/12 = 2/3 => A + B = -2/3.\n\nNow we have two equations:\nA - B = 1/12\nA + B = -2/3\nAdding: 2A = 1/12 - 2/3 = 1/12 - 8/12 = -7/12 => A = -7/24.\nSubstituting back: -7/24 + B = -2/3 => B = -2/3 + 7/24 = (-16/24 + 7/24) = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nTherefore, log_2(y) = B = -3/8.; answer: log_2(y) = -\\frac{3}{8}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent tOwj, solving for log_2(z), thinking: From the verified linear system: A - B - C = 1/2, B - A - C = 1/3, C - A - B = 1/4, and the derived relation A + B + C = -13/12, we want to solve for C = log_2(z).
