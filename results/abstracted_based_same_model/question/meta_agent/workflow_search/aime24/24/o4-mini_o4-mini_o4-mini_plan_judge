Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From previous sub-task we computed log₂(x⁴y³z²)=−25/8. Taking the absolute value gives |−25/8|=25/8. In lowest terms m=25, n=8, which are relatively prime, so m+n=25+8=33.

proposed answer: From subtask 5 we found 4a+3b+2c = 7/2. This fraction is already in lowest terms with m=7 and n=2. Therefore m+n = 7+2 = 9.
