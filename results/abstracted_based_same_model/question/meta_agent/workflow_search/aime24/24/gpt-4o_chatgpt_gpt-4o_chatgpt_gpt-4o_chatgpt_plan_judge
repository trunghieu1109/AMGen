Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_24
proposed answer: Both agents have determined that the value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| is 61/8, where m = 61 and n = 8. Since m and n are relatively prime, we can calculate m+n as 61 + 8. Both agents agree on this calculation, and there is no discrepancy in their reasoning. Therefore, the final decision on m+n is 69.

proposed answer: Both agents have determined that the value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| is 25/8, where m = 25 and n = 8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, this is the simplest form of the fraction. To find m+n, we add these two numbers together, resulting in 33. The calculations and simplifications performed in the previous steps are consistent with the original system of equations, verifying that the answer is correct.
