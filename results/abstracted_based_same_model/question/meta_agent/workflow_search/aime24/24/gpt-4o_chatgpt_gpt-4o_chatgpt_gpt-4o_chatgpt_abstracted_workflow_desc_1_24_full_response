Let's solve this system step by step. First, add all three equations together: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Simplifying the left side, we get -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Calculate the right side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12. Therefore, -a - b - c = 13/12. Now, let's solve for individual variables. From the first equation, a = b + c + 1/2. Substitute a in the second equation: b - (b + c + 1/2) - c = 1/3, which simplifies to -2c - 1/2 = 1/3. Solving for c, we get: -2c = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6, so c = -5/12. Substitute c = -5/12 into a = b + c + 1/2: a = b - 5/12 + 1/2 = b + 1/12. Substitute a = b + 1/12 and c = -5/12 into the third equation: -5/12 - a - b = 1/4, which simplifies to -5/12 - (b + 1/12) - b = 1/4. Solving for b, we get: -5/12 - b - 1/12 - b = 1/4, -2b - 6/12 = 1/4, -2b = 1/4 + 6/12 = 9/12 = 3/4, so b = -3/8. Substitute b = -3/8 into a = b + 1/12: a = -3/8 + 1/12. Find a common denominator: a = -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24. Now we have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.
