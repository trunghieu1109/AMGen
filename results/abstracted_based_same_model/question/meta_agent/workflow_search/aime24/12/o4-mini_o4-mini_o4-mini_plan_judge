Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: We write z=4e^{iθ}. Then (75+117i)z gives real part 300 cosθ−468 sinθ, and (96+144i)/z gives real part 24 cosθ+36 sinθ. Summing gives f(θ)=324 cosθ−432 sinθ, which can be written as 540 cos(θ+φ). The maximum of cos is 1, so the largest possible real part is 540.
