Since r = 4, the polar form of z is z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ). This is a standard representation of a complex number in polar form, where θ is the argument (angle) of the complex number.; answer - z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Given z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), we can find 1/z by taking the reciprocal. Since |z| = 4, the magnitude of 1/z is 1/4, and the argument is -θ. Hence, 1/z = (1/4)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). Now, substitute these into the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. This gives (75 + 117i) * 4(cos θ + i sin θ) + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). Simplify the constants: 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ). So the expression in terms of θ is 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ).; answer - (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The separation of the real and imaginary parts is done by expanding each product and grouping terms accordingly. For the first term, (75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ), expanding and using i^2 = -1 gives a real part of 75 cos θ - 117 sin θ. Multiplying by 4 yields 300 cos θ - 468 sin θ. For the second term, (96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ), expanding and simplifying gives a real part of 96 cos θ + 144 sin θ. Multiplying by 1/4 yields 24 cos θ + 36 sin θ. Adding these real parts results in 324 cos θ - 432 sin θ.

Since r = 4, the polar form of z is z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ).

The reciprocal 1/z can be expressed as 1/z = 1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) = (1/4)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ), using the property that cos(-θ) = cos θ and sin(-θ) = -sin θ.

Second, (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ) = (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ). Therefore, the whole expression becomes 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ). This is the expression rewritten in terms of θ.; answer: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 4P4B, rewrite expression in terms of θ, thinking: Given z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), we have 1/z = 1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) = (1/4)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ) since cos is even and sin is odd. We substitute these into the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. This gives (75 + 117i) * 4(cos θ + i sin θ) + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). Simplifying, the expression becomes 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ). This is the expression rewritten in terms of θ using polar forms of z and 1/z.; answer: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = 4(75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ngzO, rewrite expression in terms of θ, thinking: Given z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), we can find 1/z by taking the reciprocal.

We first expand each product using the distributive property and Euler's formula. For the first term: (75 + 117i)(cos θ + i sin θ) = 75 cos θ + 75 i sin θ + 117 i cos θ + 117 i^2 sin θ. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 75 cos θ + 75 i sin θ + 117 i cos θ - 117 sin θ. Grouping real and imaginary parts: Real part: 75 cos θ - 117 sin θ; Imaginary part: 75 sin θ + 117 cos θ. Multiply by 4: Real part: 4(75 cos θ - 117 sin θ) = 300 cos θ - 468 sin θ; Imaginary part: 4(75 sin θ + 117 cos θ) = 300 sin θ + 468 cos θ. For the second term: (96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ) = 96 cos θ - 96 i sin θ + 144 i cos θ - 144 i^2 sin θ. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 96 cos θ - 96 i sin θ + 144 i cos θ + 144 sin θ. Grouping real and imaginary parts: Real part: 96 cos θ + 144 sin θ; Imaginary part: -96 sin θ + 144 cos θ. Multiply by 1/4: Real part: (1/4)(96 cos θ + 144 sin θ) = 24 cos θ + 36 sin θ; Imaginary part: (1/4)(-96 sin θ + 144 cos θ) = -24 sin θ + 36 cos θ. Now, sum the real parts: (300 cos θ - 468 sin θ) + (24 cos θ + 36 sin θ) = (300 + 24) cos θ + (-468 + 36) sin θ = 324 cos θ - 432 sin θ.
