For the first term, (75+117i)z becomes (75+117i)(4e^(iθ)). For the second term, (96+144i)/z becomes (96+144i)/(4e^(iθ)) = (96+144i) * (1/(4e^(iθ))) = (96+144i) * (1/4) * e^(-iθ). Now, we simplify each term. The first term becomes (300+468i)e^(iθ). The second term becomes (24+36i)e^(-iθ). The expression is now (300+468i)e^(iθ) + (24+36i)e^(-iθ). To separate the real and imaginary parts, we use Euler's formula: e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) and e^(-iθ) = cos(θ) - i sin(θ). Now, (300+468i)e^(iθ) = (300+468i)(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) and (24+36i)e^(-iθ) = (24+36i)(cos(θ) - i sin(θ)). Expanding these, we get: (300 cos(θ) - 468 sin(θ)) + i(300 sin(θ) + 468 cos(θ)) for the first term, and (24 cos(θ) + 36 sin(θ)) + i(24 sin(θ) - 36 cos(θ)) for the second term.

The original method used was to express the real part as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions: 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ). The maximum value of such an expression is given by the amplitude R = √(A² + B²), where A = 324 and B = -432. Calculating R gives √(324² + 432²) = 540. Another method is to consider the expression in terms of the complex number z = re^{iθ}, where |z| = 4.
