Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: The original expression can be rewritten in terms of trigonometric functions as A cos θ + B sin θ, where A and B are constants derived from the coefficients of z and 1/z. The maximum value of such an expression over θ in [0, 2π] is the magnitude of the vector (A, B), which is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Given A = 324 and B = -432, we calculate sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. This confirms that the largest possible real part of the original expression is 540.
