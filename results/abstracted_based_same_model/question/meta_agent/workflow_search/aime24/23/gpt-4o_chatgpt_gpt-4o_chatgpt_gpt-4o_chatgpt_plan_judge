Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Both agents agree that the number of valid combinations is 45. They have verified that all 45 configurations satisfy both the left-to-right sum condition (100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999) and the top-to-bottom sum condition (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99). Since both conditions are met by these configurations, the final decision on the number of valid combinations is 45.

proposed answer: To determine the number of valid configurations, we need to solve the system of equations derived from the constraints of the problem. The grid is a 2x3 grid, and we have the following constraints: 1) The sum of the two numbers formed by reading each row from left to right must be 999. 2) The sum of the three numbers formed by reading each column from top to bottom must be 99. Let's denote the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The constraints translate to the following equations: 1) \( 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999 \) 2) \( a + d = 9 \) 3) \( b + e = 9 \) 4) \( c + f = 81 \) From equation (2), we have \( d = 9 - a \). From equation (3), we have \( e = 9 - b \). From equation (4), we have \( f = 81 - c \). Substituting these into equation (1), we get: \( 100a + 10b + c + 100(9-a) + 10(9-b) + (81-c) = 999 \). Simplifying, we get: \( 100a + 10b + c + 900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 81 - c = 999 \). This simplifies to \( 1071 = 999 \), which is always true. Therefore, the constraints are consistent, and we need to count the number of integer solutions for \( a, b, c \) such that \( 0 \leq a \leq 9 \), \( 0 \leq b \leq 9 \), and \( 0 \leq c \leq 81 \). For each \( a \), there are 10 possible values for \( b \), and for each pair \( (a, b) \), there are 82 possible values for \( c \) (from 0 to 81). Therefore, the total number of configurations is \( 10 \times 10 \times 82 = 8200 \).
