Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Each valid grid assignment corresponds uniquely to nonnegative integers a,b,c summing to 8 (the excess to reach 999 horizontally), with each ≤9. The vertical sums then force the bottom row digits. The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1, 3−1) = C(10,2) = 45, so there are 45 such grids.

proposed answer: We need the number of 2×3 digit grids where the sum of the two 3-digit rows is 999 and the sum of the three 2-digit columns is 99. Label the top row digits a,b,c; then the bottom row must be 9−a,9−b,9−c so that each column sums to 9. The row sum condition a+b+c + (9−a)+(9−b)+(9−c) = 999 implies 18 = 999−999 so simplifies to a+b+c = 8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.
