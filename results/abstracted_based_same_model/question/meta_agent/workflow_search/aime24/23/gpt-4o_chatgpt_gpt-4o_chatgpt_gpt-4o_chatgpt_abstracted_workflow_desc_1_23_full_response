Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent sWlX', content="To determine the number of valid configurations, we need to solve the system of equations derived from the constraints of the problem. The grid is a 2x3 grid, and we have the following constraints: 1) The sum of the two numbers formed by reading each row from left to right must be 999. 2) The sum of the three numbers formed by reading each column from top to bottom must be 99.
