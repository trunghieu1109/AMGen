Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: The product is given by \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, \( \omega \neq 1 \). This can be rewritten as \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) \) with \( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). The product over all 13th roots of unity is the resultant of \( P(x) \) and \( x^{13} - 1 \). The roots of \( P(x) \) are \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \). Evaluating \( (1+i)^{13} - 1 \) and \( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \) using polar form and De Moivre's theorem gives \( -65 - 64i \) and \( -65 + 64i \) respectively. Their product is \( (-65)^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \). Therefore, the product is 8321. Taking modulo 1000, the remainder is \( 8321 \mod 1000 = 321 \). Hence, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.
