Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: From sub-task 8 we have P=8321. To find P mod 1000, subtract 8×1000=8000: 8321−8000=321. Thus the remainder is 321.

Answer:321
Extracted answer: 321
Correct answer: 321
