To express this in terms of a polynomial f(x), we set x = ω^k and rewrite: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hence the quadratic polynomial f(x) whose value at x=ω^k gives each factor is f(x)=x^2 - 2x + 2.

Here P(x)=x^13−1 has leading coefficient 1 and roots ω^k (k=0..12), and Q(x)=f(x)=x^2−2x+2. Since the leading coefficient of P is 1, we get Res(x^13−1, f(x)) = ∏_{k=0..12} f(ω^k). But ∏_{k=0..12} f(ω^k) is exactly the product we started with.

Concretely, if g(x)=a_n∏_{i=1}^n(x−α_i) then Res(g,f)=a_n^{deg(f)}∏_{i=1}^n f(α_i).  Here g(x)=x^13−1 has leading coefficient 1 and roots ω^k for k=0,…,12, and f(x)=x^2−2x+2 has leading coefficient 1.

Here f(x)=x^2−2x+2 has leading coefficient a_2=1 and g(x)=x^13−1 has degree n=13. Hence Res(g,f) = 1^13 · ∏_{β: f(β)=0} (β^13−1) = ∏_{β: f(β)=0} (β^13−1). Since we already saw ∏_{k=0}^{12}f(ω^k)=Res(x^13−1,f(x)), this reduces the original product to ∏_{β roots of f}(β^13−1).; answer: Res(x^13−1,f(x)) = ∏_{β: f(β)=0} (β^13 − 1)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent vqd4, feedback round 0, thinking: The step correctly invokes the resultant formula Res(g,f)=a_m^n ∏_{β:f(β)=0}g(β) with g(x)=x^13−1 and f(x)=x^2−2x+2. However it overlooks three points: (1) the product you want, ∏_{k=0}^{12}f(ω^k), is actually Res(f,g), not Res(g,f); one must use Res(g,f)=(-1)^{mn}Res(f,g) to swap g and f; (2) you must assume gcd(f,g)=1 so there are no common roots; (3) you must include the factor a_m^n (here 1^13=1) and the sign (here (-1)^{2·13}=1) when applying the formula. Without checking these, the identification of the original product with ∏_{β:f(β)=0}(β^13−1) is incomplete.; answer: The reduction holds only if f and g share no roots (gcd(f,g)=1), and one keeps track of the leading‐coefficient factor a_m^n and the sign (−1)^{mn} when swapping Res(f,g)↔Res(g,f). In this case a_2^13=1 and (−1)^{2·13}=1, so indeed ∏_{k=0}^{12}f(ω^k)=Res(f,x^13−1)=Res(x^13−1,f)=∏_{β:f(β)=0}(β^13−1).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent hlah, revised reduction, thinking: We want to express ∏_{k=0}^{12}f(ω^k) as a resultant Res(g,f) and then apply the formula Res(g,f)=a_m^n∏_{β:f(β)=0}g(β).

We compute β1^13 via polar form: 1 + i = √2·e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (√2)^13·e^{i·13π/4} = 2^{6.5}·e^{i(2π + 5π/4)} = 2^{6.5}·e^{i5π/4} = 2^{6.5}·(−√2/2 − i√2/2) = −2^{6.5}·(√2/2)·(1 + i) = −2^6·(1 + i) = −64(1 + i).

First compute (1+i)^13. Write 1+i in polar form: r = |1+i| = √2, arg = π/4. Then (1+i)^13 = (√2)^13 · cis(13·π/4) = 2^(6.5)·cis(13π/4) = 64√2·cis(13π/4). Reduce the angle: 13π/4 = 2π + 5π/4, so cis(13π/4) = cis(5π/4) = cos(5π/4)+i\u2009sin(5π/4) = -√2/2 - i\u2009√2/2. Multiply: 64√2·(-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64·(-1 - i) = -64 -64i.

Hence B=−64+64i−1=−65+64i.; answer: -65 + 64i\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent fttQ, compute B, thinking: We have β2 = 1 − i. We need B = (1 − i)^13 − 1. Compute (1 − i)^13 via polar form: |1 − i| = √2, arg = −π/4. Then (1 − i)^13 = (√2)^13 · e^(−13πi/4) = 2^(13/2)·e^(−13πi/4) = 2^6·√2·e^(−13πi/4) = 64√2·e^(−3.25πi).
