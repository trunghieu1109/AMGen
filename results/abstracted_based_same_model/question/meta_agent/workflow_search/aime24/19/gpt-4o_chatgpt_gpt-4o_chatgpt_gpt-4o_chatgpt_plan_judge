Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: In sub-task 3, the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) was simplified to 169. The task in sub-task 4 is to compute the remainder of this value when divided by 1000. Since 169 is less than 1000, the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000 is simply 169 itself. This is because when a number is less than the divisor, the remainder is the number itself. Both agents agree on this reasoning, and it is mathematically sound.

Answer:169

is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: Both agents agree that the numerical value obtained in sub-task 3 is 8065. To find the remainder when 8065 is divided by 1000, we perform the division 8065 รท 1000. The quotient is 8, and the remainder is the part of 8065 that is not completely divisible by 1000, which is 65. Therefore, the remainder of 8065 when divided by 1000 is 65. Both agents have correctly calculated this remainder.
