Another key identity involving roots of unity is that for any complex number a, the product ∏_{k=0}^{n−1}(a−ω^k) is equal to a^n−1, where n is the order of the roots of unity.

The resultant of two polynomials is a scalar that is zero if and only if the polynomials have a common root. In this case, the roots of g(x) are the 13th roots of unity, ω^k for k = 0, 1, ..., 12. The expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} is equivalent to evaluating f(x) at x = ω^k, since f(ω^k) = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Therefore, the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) is the product of the evaluations of f(x) at all the roots of g(x). This is precisely the definition of the resultant of f(x) and g(x), which is the product of f(x) evaluated at the roots of g(x).

The roots of a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c are given by the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. For f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, we have a = 1, b = -2, and c = 2. The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex. The roots are x = (2 ± √(-4)) / 2 = (2 ± 2i) / 2 = 1 ± i. Therefore, f(x) can be factored as (x - (1 - i))(x - (1 + i)).; answer - The polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 factors into linear factors as (x - (1 - i))(x - (1 + i)).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2c output: thinking - We are given the product \\( P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\).

We start by expressing 1-i and 1+i in polar form. The modulus of both 1-i and 1+i is sqrt(2). The argument of 1-i is -pi/4 and the argument of 1+i is pi/4. Using De Moivre's theorem, (1-i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13}(cos(-13pi/4) + i sin(-13pi/4)) and (1+i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13}(cos(13pi/4) + i sin(13pi/4)). Simplifying, (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{6.5} = 64sqrt(2). The angles -13pi/4 and 13pi/4 are equivalent to -pi/4 and pi/4 respectively, since 13 is 1 more than a multiple of 4. Therefore, (1-i)^{13} = 64sqrt(2)(cos(-pi/4) + i sin(-pi/4)) = 64(1-i) and (1+i)^{13} = 64(1+i). Thus, (1-i)^{13} - 1 = 64(1-i) - 1 = 63 - 64i and (1+i)^{13} - 1 = 64(1+i) - 1 = 63 + 64i.
