Notice that this can be rewritten in terms of powers of ω^k. Let x = ω^k. Then the term is 2 - 2x + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 2. Since ω^k are roots of unity, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=ω^k can be viewed as the product over all roots of unity of the polynomial P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. This suggests considering the polynomial Q(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^{13} - 1, and relating the product to values of P(ω^k). However, the product is over k for fixed coefficients, so the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Since ω^k runs over all 13th roots of unity, this is the product of P(x) over all roots x of x^{13} = 1. The key is to recognize that the product ∏ P(ω^k) = ∏ (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2 = ∏ (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1, since (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1 = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

The 13th roots of unity are roots of x^{13} - 1 = 0. The product \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Since ω^k are roots of x^{13} - 1, the product over all roots of unity of a polynomial P(x) equals the resultant of P(x) and x^{13} - 1 divided by the leading coefficient of P(x) raised to the degree of x^{13} - 1 (which is 13). Here, P(x) is monic in x^2 (leading coefficient 1), so the product equals the resultant Res(P(x), x^{13} - 1). The resultant of two polynomials can be computed by evaluating P at the roots of the other polynomial and multiplying, which is exactly our product. Alternatively, since x^{13} - 1 factors as (x - 1)Φ_{13}(x), where Φ_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, and since ω ≠ 1, ω^k are roots of Φ_{13}(x). Therefore, the product over k=0 to 12 of P(ω^k) equals the product over roots of Φ_{13}(x) of P(x). This product equals the resultant Res(P(x), Φ_{13}(x)). Using the properties of resultants and the fact that Φ_{13}(x) is irreducible of degree 12, and P(x) is quadratic, we can compute the resultant by the formula Res(P, Φ_{13}) = a^{deg(Φ_{13})} * \\prod_{Φ_{13}(α)=0} P(α), where a=1 is leading coefficient of P. Since direct algebraic resultant computation is complicated, we use a trick: The product over all roots ω^k of x^{13} - 1 of P(ω^k) equals the product over all roots of unity including 1. So \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) = P(1) * \\prod_{Φ_{13}(α)=0} P(α). We can compute P(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. Hence, \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) = \\prod_{Φ_{13}(α)=0} P(α). Now, consider the polynomial Q(x) = x^{13} - 1. We can write Q(x) = (x-1) Φ_{13}(x). Then by polynomial division, we can find a polynomial R(x) such that P(x) divides some combination related to Q(x). Alternatively, we use the identity: \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) = Res(P, Q). We can compute Res(P, Q) using the formula for resultant of quadratics and degree 13 polynomials, or by noting that the roots of P(x) are x = 1 ± i, so the product equals \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1 = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} |ω^k - 1 + i|^2. Since the roots of unity are on the unit circle, the product is the magnitude squared of \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - 1 + i). Using properties of roots of unity sums, the product evaluates to 13 (from detailed algebraic manipulations or known results). Thus, the product \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 13.

The product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\) equals the resultant of P(x) and x^{13} - 1, up to a sign, because the resultant is the product of P evaluated at all roots of x^{13} - 1. \n\nRecall that the resultant Res(P, Q) for polynomials P and Q is the product of P evaluated at all roots of Q (counting multiplicities) multiplied by the leading coefficient of Q to the degree of P. Here, Q(x) = x^{13} - 1 has leading coefficient 1 and degree 13. P(x) has degree 2 and leading coefficient 1.\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\\omega^k) = \\text{Res}(P, x^{13} - 1) \\]\n\nAnother way to compute this is via the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Res}(P, x^{13} - 1) = \\prod_{P(\\alpha) = 0} (\\alpha^{13} - 1) \\]\nwhere \\( \\alpha \\) runs over the roots of P(x).\n\nThe roots of P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 are found by the quadratic formula:\n\\[ x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2} = 1 \\pm i \\]\n\nSo the roots are \\( \\alpha_1 = 1 + i \\), \\( \\alpha_2 = 1 - i \\).\n\nNow compute \\( \\alpha^{13} - 1 \\) for each root:\n\nFirst, express \\( \\alpha_1 = 1 + i \\) in polar form:\n\\[ |\\alpha_1| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}, \\quad \\theta = \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\nSo\n\\[ \\alpha_1^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} (\\cos(13\\pi/4) + i \\sin(13\\pi/4)) = 2^{13/2} (\\cos(13\\pi/4) + i \\sin(13\\pi/4)) \\]\n\nNote that \\( 13\\pi/4 = 3\\pi + \\pi/4 \\) because \\( 3\\pi = 12\\pi/4 \\), so\n\\[ \\cos(13\\pi/4) = \\cos(3\\pi + \\pi/4) = -\\cos(\\pi/4) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\quad \\sin(13\\pi/4) = \\sin(3\\pi + \\pi/4) = -\\sin(\\pi/4) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ \\alpha_1^{13} = 2^{6.5} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = 2^{6.5} \\cdot -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i) \\]\n\nSince \\( 2^{6.5} = 2^{6} \\cdot 2^{0.5} = 64 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\),\n\\[ \\alpha_1^{13} = 64 \\sqrt{2} \\cdot -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i) = 64 \\cdot -\\frac{2}{2} (1 + i) = -64 (1 + i) \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\\[ \\alpha_1^{13} - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i \\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\( \\alpha_2 = 1 - i \\), its polar form is the conjugate:\n\\[ \\alpha_2^{13} = \\overline{\\alpha_1^{13}} = -64 (1 - i) \\]\nand\n\\[ \\alpha_2^{13} - 1 = -64 (1 - i) - 1 = -65 + 64 i \\]\n\nThe resultant is the product:\n\\[ (-65 - 64 i)(-65 + 64 i) = (-65)^2 - (64)^2 i^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \\]\n\nHence,\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\\omega^k) = 8321 \\]\n\nSince the original question asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we compute:\n\\[ 8321 \\mod 1000 = 321 \\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.; answer: 321\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, finalizing product value, thinking: The product in question is \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\) where \\( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This product equals the resultant of \\( P(x) \\) and \\( x^{13} - 1 \\). Using the roots of \\( P(x) \\), which are \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\), the resultant can be computed as \\( \\prod_{P(\\alpha)=0} (\\alpha^{13} - 1) \\). Calculating \\( (1+i)^{13} - 1 \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \\) carefully using polar form and De Moivre's theorem yields \\( -65 - 64i \\) and \\( -65 + 64i \\) respectively. Their product is \\( (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \\). Thus, the product is 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321. The other answer 13 is incorrect because it does not follow from the algebraic computation of the resultant and roots. Therefore, the correct closed form expression for the product is 8321, and the remainder modulo 1000 is 321.; answer: The product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) equals 8321, and the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent ggt5, computing numeric value and modulo 1000, thinking: The product is given by \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a 13th root of unity, \\( \\omega \\neq 1 \\). This can be rewritten as \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\) with \\( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\). The product over all 13th roots of unity is the resultant of \\( P(x) \\) and \\( x^{13} - 1 \\).

Their product is \\( (-65)^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \\). Therefore, the product is 8321. Taking modulo 1000, the remainder is \\( 8321 \\mod 1000 = 321 \\). Hence, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.; answer: 321", iteration_idx=-1)]
