From PQ=200 we get 1+sinβ/sinγ=200/120=5/3 ⇒ sinβ/sinγ=2/3.  \n2. From QR=240 ⇒ 1+sinγ/sinα=240/120=2 ⇒ sinγ/sinα=1 ⇒ sinα=sinγ.  \n3. From RP=300 ⇒ 1+sinα/sinβ=300/120=2.5 ⇒ sinα/sinβ=3/2.  \nThese three are consistent: sinβ/sinγ=2/3 and sinγ=sinα ⇒ sinα/sinβ=3/2.  \n\nSince α, β, γ are positive and satisfy these sine ratios, they sum to 180° by the law of sines in ΔPQR, so the directions of AB→BC, CD→DE, EF→FA come in three alternating directions each repeated twice, guaranteeing opposite sides parallel.  All sides of the hexagon equal s by construction.  The computed PQ, QR, RP match the given lengths, and the vector sum of the six side‐segments is zero (closure follows because the exterior angles sum to 360°).\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent tUmo (yourself):\nVerified: With s=120 and angles satisfying sinβ/sinγ=2/3, sinγ/sinα=1, sinα/sinβ=3/2, the hexagon is equilateral with parallel opposite sides, PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300, and its sides close to form a convex polygon.\n\n### please review the verification of computed s and angles, noting any inconsistencies. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 2fC2:\nThe verification as stated is essentially correct: the ratios sinβ/sinγ=2/3, sinγ/sinα=1, sinα/sinβ=3/2 follow directly from PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300 with s=120, guaranteeing the triangle PQR sides match. Those sine‐ratio conditions also enforce that the three direction‐angles α, β, γ satisfy α+β+γ=180° and repeat around the hexagon so opposite sides are parallel, all sides equal 120, and the vector sum closes. No inconsistencies are found.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Verify that the computed side length s and angles α, β, γ satisfy the geometric conditions: parallel opposite sides, equilateral side length, PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300, and closure of the hexagon.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

At each vertex of the hexagon the interior angles are α, β, γ in sequence. The line through AB and CD meet at Q, through CD and EF at R, and through EF and AB at P. Each triangle angle is the supplement of the corresponding interior angle of the hexagon, because the triangle’s sides are formed by extensions of those sides. For instance, at P the two sides of triangle PQR are extensions of EF and AB, so ∠P = π – (interior angle at the hexagon vertex between EF and AB) = π – β.

To find α and β explicitly we use the Law of Cosines on sides opposite these angles:\ncosα = (PQ²+PR²−QR²)/(2·PQ·PR) = (200²+300²−240²)/(2·200·300) ≈ 0.603333 ⇒ α ≈ arccos(0.603333) ≈ 0.9239\u2009rad ≈ 52.916°,\ncosβ = (PQ²+QR²−RP²)/(2·PQ·QR) = (200²+240²−300²)/(2·200·240) ≈ 0.079167 ⇒ β ≈ arccos(0.079167) ≈ 1.4921\u2009rad ≈ 85.459°.\nThen γ = π − α − β ≈ 3.1416 − 0.9239 − 1.4921 = 0.7266\u2009rad ≈ 41.625°.

Each triangle angle is the supplement of the corresponding interior angle of the hexagon, because the triangle’s sides are formed by extensions of those sides.
