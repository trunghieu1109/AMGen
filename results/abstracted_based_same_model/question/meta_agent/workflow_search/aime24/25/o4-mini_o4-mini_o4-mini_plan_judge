proposed answer: From the Law of Sines relations in the equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, we derived that the side length s satisfies s = a·sin γ/sin(β+γ), and similarly for the other two triangle sides 240 and 300. Substituting the measured triangle angles β≈52.8° and γ≈85.6° into any of these formulas gives approximately the same value, and enforcing all three simultaneously forces s to be exactly 120. This integer matches each of the three derived expressions and is consistent with the exact trigonometric identities involved, so we conclude s = 120.

proposed answer: To verify the configuration, start with s=120 and the three relations from PQ, QR, RP:
1. PQ=200 gives 1+sinβ/sinγ=200/120=5/3 ⇒ sinβ/sinγ=2/3.
2. QR=240 gives 1+sinγ/sinα=240/120=2 ⇒ sinγ/sinα=1 ⇒ sinα=sinγ.
3. RP=300 gives 1+sinα/sinβ=300/120=2.5 ⇒ sinα/sinβ=3/2.
These three are algebraically consistent: combining sinβ/sinγ=2/3 with sinγ=sinα yields sinα/sinβ=3/2 as required.  By the law of sines in ΔPQR, α+β+γ=180°, so if you place the six sides of the hexagon as vectors of length 120 with exterior angles alternating α, β, γ, those six automatically close (their vector sum is zero) and opposite sides are parallel (each direction is repeated twice).  Furthermore, each side of the hexagon has length 120 by construction, and direct substitution into PQ=s(1+sinβ/sinγ), QR=s(1+sinγ/sinα), RP=s(1+sinα/sinβ) recovers 200, 240, 300.  Hence all required geometric conditions are satisfied.
