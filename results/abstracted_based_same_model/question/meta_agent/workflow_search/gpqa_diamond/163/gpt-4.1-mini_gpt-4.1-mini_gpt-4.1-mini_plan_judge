Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The total mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is calculated using the formula M1/M2 = ((K1_1 + K2_1) / (K1_2 + K2_2))^3 * (P1 / P2), where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes and P is the orbital period. For system_1, the sum of radial velocity amplitudes is 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, and the period is 2 years. For system_2, the sum is 15 + 10 = 25 km/s, and the period is 1 year. Plugging in these values, we get (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = (0.6)^3 * 2 = 0.216 * 2 = 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. Among the given options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), 0.4 is the closest. This means system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2, or equivalently, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by this factor. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
