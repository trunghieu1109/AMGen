Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_162
proposed answer: Dissolving 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ (0.000936 mol) requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃ ⇒ 0.002808 mol H⁺. A 0.1 M acid delivers 0.002805 mol H⁺ in 28.05 mL, essentially matching the consumption so that no strong acid remains. The resulting [Fe³⁺] = 0.000936 mol/0.100 L = 0.00936 M. Hydrolysis (Ka₁≈6.3×10⁻³) yields [H⁺]≈√(Ka₁·c)=√(6.3×10⁻³·9.36×10⁻³)≈9×10⁻³ M, pH≈2.04. This matches choice A.

proposed answer: To dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ requires (0.1 g/106.87 g·mol⁻¹)×3 = 2.805×10⁻³ mol H⁺. At 0.1 M acid, that is 28.05 cm³, with no excess acid. The resulting Fe³⁺ concentration is 9.35×10⁻³ M, which hydrolyzes (K₁≈6.3×10⁻³) to release H⁺ until equilibrium. Solving x²/(0.00935–x)=6.3×10⁻³ gives x≈9.12–9.67×10⁻³ M, so pH≈2.01–2.04. The closest provided option is A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³.
