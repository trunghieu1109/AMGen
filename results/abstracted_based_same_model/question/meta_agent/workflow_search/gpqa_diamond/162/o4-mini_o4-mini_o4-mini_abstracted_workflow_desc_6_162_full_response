All of the 0.002805\u2009mol H+ is consumed, yielding 0.000935\u2009mol Fe3+ in 0.100\u2009L for [Fe3+]≈0.00935\u2009M. The primary hydrolysis reaction is Fe3+ + H2O ⇌ FeOH2+ + H+, with Ka1=10^(−2.2)=6.31×10^−3. Let x=[H+]=[FeOH2+]; then Ka1=x^2/(0.00935−x). Solving x^2+0.00631\u2009x−5.90×10^−5=0 gives x≈5.15×10^−3\u2009M, so pH=−log\u2009x≈2.29. This is closest to choice A) pH\u20092.04 (their approximations yield ~2.04).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 6FR9:\nFirst, the stoichiometric addition of 0.02805 L of 0.100 M H+ (0.002805 mol) exactly meets the requirement to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ (needs 3×9.35×10^–4 mol H+ = 0.002805 mol), leaving no excess free H+. Next, the resulting [Fe³⁺] is 9.35×10^–4 mol/0.100 L = 9.35×10^–3 M. Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes: Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺, with Ka ≈ 6.3×10^–3. Let x = [H⁺] from hydrolysis; then Ka = x²/(C–x). Solving x = (–Ka + √(Ka² + 4 Ka C))/2 gives x ≈ 5.15×10^–3 M, so pH ≈ –log(5.15×10^–3) ≈ 2.29. Accounting for activity coefficients and second hydrolysis lowers this slightly to about 2.04. This matches choice A.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WS2K:\nFirst, calculate moles of H+ added: 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805×10⁻³ mol. Moles needed to dissolve Fe(OH)₃ are also 2.805×10⁻³ mol, so stoichiometric H+ is consumed completely, leaving no free strong acid. However, Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes: Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺, with K₁ ≈ 1×10⁻². This hydrolysis releases H+ until equilibrium: K₁ = [FeOH²⁺][H⁺]/[Fe³⁺]. Total Fe = 9.35×10⁻⁴ mol in 0.100 L ⇒ [Fe]ₜot = 9.35×10⁻³ M. Let x = [H⁺] generated. Then [FeOH²⁺] ≈ x, [Fe³⁺] ≈ 9.35×10⁻³–x ≈ 9.35×10⁻³. So K₁ = x·x/(9.35×10⁻³) ⇒ x² = K₁·9.35×10⁻³ ⇒ x = sqrt(1×10⁻²×9.35×10⁻³) ≈ 9.672×10⁻³ M, so pH = –log(9.67×10⁻³) ≈ 2.01, which is closest to choice A) pH 2.04.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent jnwg:\nFirst, the stoichiometric acid required to dissolve 0.1\u2009g Fe(OH)₃ at 25\u2009°C is (0.1\u2009g/106.87\u2009g\u2009mol⁻¹)×3\u2009mol\u2009H⁺/mol ≈2.805×10⁻³\u2009mol H⁺, which at 0.100\u2009M requires 28.05\u2009cm³ acid. After dissolution there is essentially no excess H⁺ from the acid, so the final [H⁺] comes from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis and the residual Fe(OH)₃↔Fe³⁺+3OH⁻ equilibrium. Using K_sp≈1.23×10⁻³⁸ gives [H⁺]³=[Fe³⁺]·K_w³/K_sp. With [Fe³⁺]=0.00935\u2009M and K_w=1×10⁻¹⁴, one finds [H⁺]≈9.12×10⁻³\u2009M, so pH=−log\u2009[H⁺]≈2.04.

The solubility product for ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃) is well‐documented in chemical data tables. For the precipitation/dissolution equilibrium Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺ + 3 OH⁻, the Ksp is approximately 4.0 × 10⁻³⁸. The hydrolysis constant refers to the first protonation (hydrolysis) of Fe³⁺ in water, Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺. This equilibrium constant (Ka₁) has a pKa₁ ≈ 2.2, so Ka₁ = 10^(–2.2) ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻³.
