Assuming the rest wavelength of the peak is in the optical range, let's consider a typical rest wavelength for a quasar emission line, such as the Lyman-alpha line, which is at 121.6 nm. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula: z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. If we assume the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5.
