With H0=70 km/s/Mpc and c/H0≈4280 Mpc, and z≈5.5 from the infrared cutoff at 790 nm, numerical evaluation of the integral ∫₀^5.5 dz\'/√[0.3(1+z\')^3+0.7] yields about 1.87.

For z ≃ 5.5 (from Sub-task 2):\n  ∫0^5.5 dz′/√[0.3(1+z′)^3 + 0.7] ≃ 1.87  (numerical integration)\nThus Dc ≃ 4286 Mpc × 1.87 ≃ 8000 Mpc ≃ 8.0 Gpc.

Using c/H0≈4280\u2009Mpc and numerically integrating ∫0^5.5 dz\'/√[0.3(1+z\')^3+0.7] ≃1.87 yields Dc≈4280×1.87\u2009Mpc≈8000\u2009Mpc≈8\u2009Gpc.
