The redshift z is calculated as z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1 = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5. This high redshift indicates that the quasar is very distant, and the light we see was emitted when the universe was much younger. In the Lambda-CDM cosmology with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, and flat universe, a redshift of about 5.5 corresponds to a comoving distance on the order of several Gpc, typically around 7-9 Gpc.
