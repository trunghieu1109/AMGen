proposed answer: The redshift of the quasar is approximately z = 5.5, and using the Lambda-CDM cosmological model with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_Lambda = 0.7, and a flat universe, the comoving distance is calculated by integrating c / H(z) from 0 to z. This calculation yields a comoving distance close to 7 Gpc. Among the given options (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 9 Gpc), 7 Gpc is the closest and most reasonable estimate for the comoving distance to the quasar.

proposed answer: The validated comoving distance from subtask 5 is approximately 8.14 Gpc, which is very close to 8 Gpc. Among the provided options (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 9 Gpc), 8 Gpc is the closest to the computed value. The discrepancy between the computed value and 8 Gpc is only about 1.75%, which is well within the acceptable 5% margin. Therefore, based on the numerical results and the cosmological context of a Lambda-CDM universe with the given parameters, the best choice is 8 Gpc.
