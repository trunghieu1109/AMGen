Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To compute the comoving distance Dc for a source at redshift z≈5.5 in a flat ΛCDM universe (H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) we use:

 Dc=(c/H0) ∫0^z dz′/√[Ωm(1+z′)^3+ΩΛ].

With c/H0≈300000 km/s ÷ 70 km/s/Mpc≈4286 Mpc, and numerically evaluating ∫0^5.5 dz′/√[0.3(1+z′)^3+0.7]≈1.87, we get Dc≈4286×1.87≈8000 Mpc≈8 Gpc. Comparing to the choices (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc), 8 Gpc is the closest match.
