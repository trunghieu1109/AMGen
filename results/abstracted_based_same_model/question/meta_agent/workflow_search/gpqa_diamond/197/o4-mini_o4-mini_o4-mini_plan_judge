Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_197
proposed answer: To find the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt species, divide its concentration [Co(SCN)₂] ≈ 1.56×10⁻³ M by the total cobalt concentration (1.00×10⁻² M) and multiply by 100:
(1.56×10⁻³ M / 1.00×10⁻² M) × 100% ≈ 15.6%. Among the provided answers (16.9%, 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%), 15.6% is closest to 16.9%, corresponding to choice A).
