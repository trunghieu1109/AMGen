Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

proposed answer: The task is to determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The stability constant β2 for Co(SCN)2 is given as 40, and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- are 10^-2 M and 0.1 M, respectively. The sub-task responses indicate that the concentration of Co(SCN)2 was calculated using these values and the stability constant, leading to a percentage of 42.3% of the total cobalt species. All agents agree on this percentage, and it corresponds to choice B. Therefore, the final decision is that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is 42.3%, which is choice B.

proposed answer: All agents have calculated the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species using the formula: (Concentration of [Co(SCN)2] / Total cobalt concentration) * 100%. They have used the concentration of the blue dithiocyanato complex as 0.169 M and the total cobalt concentration as 0.01 M. The calculation (0.169 / 0.01) * 100% results in 16.9%. This matches choice A) 16.9%. Therefore, the final decision is that the percentage is 16.9%, corresponding to choice A).
