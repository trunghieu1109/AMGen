Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_197
proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 is calculated as 0.001692 M. From Sub-task 7, the total cobalt concentration in the solution is 0.01 M. To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration, we use the formula: (concentration of dithiocyanato complex / total cobalt concentration) * 100% = (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.92%. This matches closely with choice A) 16.9%. Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt species in the solution is 16.9%.
