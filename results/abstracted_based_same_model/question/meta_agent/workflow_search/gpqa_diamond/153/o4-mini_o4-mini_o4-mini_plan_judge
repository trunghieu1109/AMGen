Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion at m/z 156 (with an M+2 peak at 158, ~32%) indicates a monochlorinated C7H5ClO2. The IR broad band 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ plus a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a 1H singlet at 11.0 ppm (COOH) and an AA′BB′ pattern of two doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these features.
