Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data provided aligns well with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156, which matches the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The additional peak at m/z = 158 suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, due to its natural isotopic abundance (35Cl and 37Cl). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of an O-H stretch, which is typical for a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 corresponds to a C=O stretch, supporting the presence of a carbonyl group, likely in a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, suggesting an aromatic ring with para-substitution. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria with its para-substituted aromatic ring, carboxylic acid functional group, and molecular weight of 156. Other choices do not match the para-substitution pattern or have incorrect functional groups or molecular weights. Therefore, the best match for the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
