Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_156
proposed answer: The validation of the real-time PCR kit involves testing it with known samples to ensure its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This process is crucial to confirm that the kit can reliably detect the retrovirus in real-world conditions. The choice D from the original question aligns with this process, as it involves using cDNA sequencing to develop a real-time PCR kit, which is then validated through testing with known samples. All the debate agents agree that choice D is the correct approach for designing and validating the PCR kit, as it ensures the kit is based on accurate genetic information and is tested for reliability.
