Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_156
proposed answer: Choice D is the highest‐ranked because combining cDNA sequencing with real‐time RT‐PCR allows direct detection of viral RNA, provides high sensitivity (LOD ≤100 copies), excellent specificity, rapid turnaround (<2 h), quantitative capability over 6 logs, a one‐step workflow minimizing contamination, and uses stable reagents. No other choice meets all these critical criteria.
