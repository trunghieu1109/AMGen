Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_156
proposed answer: Developing and optimizing a real-time PCR diagnostic kit using the designed primers and probes is the most effective approach for rapid and accurate detection of the retrovirus. This method directly detects viral genetic material, allowing early diagnosis even before the host immune response develops. Optimization ensures high sensitivity and specificity, minimizing false results. However, limitations include the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel, potential false negatives due to low viral load or mutations in primer/probe binding sites, and higher costs, which may limit deployment in low-resource settings. Despite these limitations, real-time PCR remains the gold standard for molecular diagnosis of viral infections, making it the best choice for this outbreak scenario.
