Choice1 sequences DNA (not appropriate for RNA virus) and uses conventional PCR (slower, less quantitative). Choice2 targets IgG (serology) giving delayed positivity and lower sensitivity, not ideal for early detection. Choice3 relies on symptoms (nonspecific) and nested PCR (more steps, contamination risk).

Choice2 relies on serology (IgG ELISA), detecting host antibodies rather than viral RNA—and cannot detect acute infections rapidly or quantify viral load. Choice3 uses symptom‐based identification without any sequencing, and a nested PCR approach increases contamination risk and is slower than real‐time methods; it also omits an explicit RT step.
