ESPRESSO on an 8\u2009m telescope can reach S/N≈10 per binned pixel in 1\u2009h at about V≈16–16.5. Thus detectable (S/N≥10) are Canopus (V≈–0.7), Polaris (V≈2.0), the 5\u2009pc star (V≈13.5), and the 10\u2009pc star (V≈15.0). The 50\u2009pc and 200\u2009pc stars are too faint.

However, this approach has several limitations:\n1. Bright‐star saturation: S/N estimates of 10^6–10^7 per binned pixel are unrealistic, as the detector will saturate long before such values are reached. Observers would need to shorten exposures or employ neutral‐density filters, altering the S/N.\n2. Instrument/atmosphere losses: We ignored fiber coupling efficiency, instrument throughput variations, seeing, and atmospheric transmission, all of which reduce the delivered S/N.\n3. Read noise and sky background: For the faintest stars, detector read noise and sky background become significant, so S/N does not scale purely with photon flux.\n4. Spectral type and line density: Different stellar spectra yield different photon distributions across the spectral orders, affecting the per‐pixel S/N.\n5. Assumed perfect conditions: Real observations include guiding errors, fiber‐link instabilities, and calibration overheads.\n\nBecause of these factors, the S/N estimates should be treated as order‐of‐magnitude guides rather than exact predictions.; answer: Canopus: True; Polaris: True; M_V=15 at 5 pc: True; M_V=15 at 10 pc: False; M_V=15 at 50 pc: False; M_V=15 at 200 pc: False\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent LVJL, refining detectability flags, thinking: We estimated the 1\u2009h S/N per binned pixel for each star with ESPRESSO on an 8\u2009m VLT using a simple photon‐flux scaling (S/N≈100 at V=12 scaled as 10^(–0.4ΔV)) and compared to the detection threshold of S/N≥10.
