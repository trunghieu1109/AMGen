Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: All four debate agents agree that mutually incompatible data formats typically cause immediate and obvious errors, which are easier to detect and thus not common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results. The issues that are subtle and often lead to difficult-to-spot errors are the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. These three issues are well-documented in genomics data analysis as common sources of subtle errors. Therefore, the answer choice that includes issues 2, 3, and 4 best corresponds to the most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors.

proposed answer: All four issues listed—mutually incompatible data formats, 'chr'/'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion—are well-known and documented sources of subtle, difficult-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis. Each can independently cause errors that are not immediately obvious and can propagate through analyses, leading to erroneous results. The 'chr'/'no chr' confusion and reference assembly mismatches are particularly notorious for causing silent coordinate misinterpretations. Incorrect ID conversion can cause mislabeling that is not easily detected. Mutually incompatible data formats can cause silent data misinterpretation or loss during processing. Since all these issues contribute significantly and are common sources of such errors, the most comprehensive and accurate answer choice is 'All of the above', which includes all four issues. This conclusion is supported unanimously by all debate agents and aligns with expert consensus in genomics data analysis.
