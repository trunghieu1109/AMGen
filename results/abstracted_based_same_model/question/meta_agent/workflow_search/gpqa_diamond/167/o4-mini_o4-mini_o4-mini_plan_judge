Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: Sub-task 2 tagged all four issues (1–4) as “common.” Each answer choice references only common issues, so they all satisfy the criterion. Among the provided options, “All of the above” (choice C) explicitly includes all these common issues.

Answer:C)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: The curated knowledge base identifies chr-prefix mismatches (issue 2), reference build mismatches (issue 3), and silent ID conversion issues (issue 4) as common difficult-to-spot error sources, but not incompatible data formats (issue 1). Choice D) encompasses exactly these three common issues, making it the most comprehensive valid set.
