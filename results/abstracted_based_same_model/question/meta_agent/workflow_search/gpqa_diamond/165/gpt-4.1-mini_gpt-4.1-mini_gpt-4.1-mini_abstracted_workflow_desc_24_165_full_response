Since the symmetry is approximate, H2 would be massless at tree level but acquires a mass through radiative corrections. The mass of H2 is thus generated at one-loop level, and its squared mass is proportional to the sum of quartic powers of masses of particles coupled to the scalar sector, weighted by coefficients and divided by the total VEV squared (x^2 + v^2). This is a typical feature of pseudo-Goldstone bosons where the mass is loop suppressed and depends on the spectrum of the theory. Therefore, radiative corrections play a crucial role in generating the mass of H2, lifting it from zero to a small but nonzero value.; answer: The pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 is massless at tree level due to spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry but gains a nonzero mass through radiative corrections. These corrections depend on the masses of particles coupled to the scalar sector and scale inversely with the total VEV squared (x^2 + v^2), thus radiative corrections are essential to generate the mass of H2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent dsUd, understanding pseudo-Goldstone boson H2, thinking: The pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 arises due to the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry in the scalar sector.

The denominator involves the total VEV squared (x^2 + v^2), reflecting the scale of symmetry breaking. Negative contributions come from fermions like the top quark and singlet fermions, while bosons contribute positively.

It correctly accounts for the positive contributions from bosonic fields (h1, W, Z, charged and neutral scalars) and negative contributions from fermionic fields (top quark and singlet fermions). The formula assumes perturbativity and that higher-loop corrections are negligible. It also presumes that the vacuum expectation values x and v are stable and that mixing effects are properly included in the mass eigenstates. Limitations include neglecting higher-order loop corrections, possible threshold effects, and potential non-perturbative phenomena. Additionally, the coefficients α_i encode model-dependent coupling strengths and multiplicities, which must be accurately determined for precise predictions.
