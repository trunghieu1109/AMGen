Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_176
proposed answer: The corrected luminosity ratio is approximately 2.27. Comparing the absolute differences: |2.27−2.25|=0.02, |2.27−2.35|=0.08, |2.27−2.32|=0.05, |2.27−2.23|=0.04. The smallest deviation is with 2.25, which corresponds to choice A). Hence, A) is the closest match.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_176
proposed answer: We computed L1/L2≈2.228 by combining the radius factor (1.5^2=2.25) and the temperature correction from identical peak wavelengths with Doppler shift ((T1/T2)^4≈0.9908). Multiplying gives ≈2.228, which is closest to ~2.23 among the choices. Hence the best match is option D).
