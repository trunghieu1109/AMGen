However, several assumptions limit its accuracy:\n1) Non-relativistic Doppler shift: at v≈700 km/s (v/c≈0.00233) relativistic corrections are small but nonzero.\n2) Perfect blackbody emission: real stellar atmospheres introduce line blanketing, limb darkening and departures from an ideal Planck spectrum.\n3) Neglect of gravitational redshift or orbital motion effects, which can shift the observed λ_peak.\n4) Measurement uncertainties in λ_peak (instrumental resolution, interstellar absorption) typically exceed the ≃0.23% temperature difference implied. \nThus, while 0.9977 is the correct formal result under these idealizations, the physical temperature ratio is effectively unity within observational and modeling errors.; answer: The ratio T₁/T₂ ≃0.9977 is correct under the simplifying assumptions but has limited physical significance due to the listed uncertainties.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent rPk9, refinement round 1, thinking: Using Wien’s displacement law (λ_peak·T=b), temperature is inversely proportional to peak wavelength.
