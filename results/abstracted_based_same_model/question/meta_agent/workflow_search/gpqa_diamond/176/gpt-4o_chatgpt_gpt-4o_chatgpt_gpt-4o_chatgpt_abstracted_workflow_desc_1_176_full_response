Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, indicating they have the same temperature. The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. These attributes are important for understanding the stars' luminosities and other properties.; answer - Star_1: Radius = 1.5 * Radius of Star_2, Mass = 1.5 * Mass of Star_2, Wavelength = Wavelength of Star_2, Radial Velocity = 0 km/s; Star_2: Radius = Radius of Star_2, Mass = Mass of Star_2, Wavelength = Wavelength of Star_1, Radial Velocity = 700 km/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem states that Star_1 has a radius that is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. This means that if the radius of Star_2 is R, then the radius of Star_1 is 1.5R. Similarly, if the mass of Star_2 is M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M. These relationships are straightforward and directly given in the problem statement.; answer - Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - The Doppler effect causes the observed wavelength of light from a moving source to be shifted. For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, there is no Doppler shift, so the observed wavelength is the same as the rest wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we need to apply the Doppler correction. The formula for the Doppler shift is λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v/c) for a source moving away from the observer. Since Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, we use this formula. The speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s, so v/c = 700/300,000 = 0.00233. Therefore, λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + 0.00233) = λ_obs / 1.00233. This means the rest wavelength is slightly shorter than the observed wavelength for Star_2.; answer - λ_rest = λ_obs / 1.00233\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3b output: thinking - Wien's Law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits most strongly. The law is given by λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien's constant, approximately 2.897 x 10^-3 m*K. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, and after applying the Doppler correction, the rest wavelengths for both stars are the same, the temperatures of the stars must also be the same. Therefore, T_rest for both stars is the same, and we do not need to compute different temperatures for them.; answer - The temperatures of both stars are the same due to the same rest wavelengths.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The Stefan-Boltzmann Law states that the luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius of the star, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the star. Since the temperatures of both stars are the same, the ratio of their luminosities depends only on the ratio of the squares of their radii.

For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, there is no Doppler shift, so the observed wavelength is the same as the rest wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we need to apply the Doppler correction. The formula for the Doppler shift is λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v/c) for a source moving away from the observer. Since Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, we use this formula. The speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s, so v/c = 700/300,000 = 0.00233.

Since the temperatures of both stars are the same, the ratio of their luminosities depends only on the ratio of the squares of their radii.

Since the wavelength of maximum emission is the same for both stars, their temperatures are equal. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2.

In this case, both stars are described as radiating as black bodies and have the same peak wavelength, which implies they have the same temperature.
