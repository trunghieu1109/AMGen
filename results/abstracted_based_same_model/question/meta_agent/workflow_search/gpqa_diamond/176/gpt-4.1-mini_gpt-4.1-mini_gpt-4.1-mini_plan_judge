Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_176
proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since the peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same, their temperatures are equal (by Wien's law). Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 simplifies to (R1/R2)^2 because T1 = T2. Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Among the provided options (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the closest and exact match to the calculated value is ~2.25. Hence, the correct choice is A).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_176
proposed answer: The luminosity ratio L1/L2 is calculated based on the fact that both stars have the same temperature (since their peak wavelengths are the same) and the luminosity of a black body star is proportional to the square of its radius times the fourth power of its temperature. Since the temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends mainly on the square of the radius ratio. Given the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio is approximately 1.5^2 = 2.25. Among the given options (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the closest value to 2.25 is option A) ~2.25. Minor differences are due to rounding. Therefore, the best choice is A).
