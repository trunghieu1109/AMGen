Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_176
proposed answer: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature. Since both stars have the same temperature, the difference in luminosity is due to the difference in their radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity of Star_1 is greater by a factor of (1.5)^2 = 2.25. This matches the choice provided in the original question as choice A).

proposed answer: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature. Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are the same. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so its luminosity is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2. This matches choice A).
