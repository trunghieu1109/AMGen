This is because the power counting of divergences in perturbation theory depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constants. If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, it leads to non-renormalizable divergences that grow with energy, making it impossible to absorb all infinities into a finite number of counterterms. In the given Lagrangian, we have determined that the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is \\(-1\\). Since \\([-1]\\) is negative, the coupling is not renormalizable. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent kIwB, assessing renormalizability, thinking: In four-dimensional quantum field theories, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because terms in the Lagrangian with positive or zero mass dimensions can be renormalized using counterterms that do not introduce new divergences. Conversely, if a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable because it leads to terms in the Lagrangian that grow with energy, introducing new divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.
