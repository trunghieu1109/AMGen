proposed answer: All agents agree that the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\). In four-dimensional quantum field theories, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \(\kappa\) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that states \(\left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1\) and that the theory is not renormalizable, which is option C).
