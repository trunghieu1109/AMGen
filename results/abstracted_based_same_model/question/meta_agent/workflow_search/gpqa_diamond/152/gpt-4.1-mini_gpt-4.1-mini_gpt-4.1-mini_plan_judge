Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: All four debate agents independently concluded that choice 2 is the correct set of reactants and major final products for the given Michael addition reactions. This conclusion is based on the matching of the predicted products A, B, and C from the previous sub-tasks with the given answer choices. Product A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, product B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, and product C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Choice 2 is the only option that matches all three products exactly, while other choices have discrepancies in at least one product. Therefore, the final decision is that choice 2 is the correct answer.

proposed answer: All four debate agents independently concluded that choice A is the correct overall answer. This conclusion is based on the matching of the predicted products A, B, and C from the previous sub-tasks with the provided answer choices. Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and product C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. Only choice A correctly matches all three products with the correct chemical naming conventions and tautomeric forms. Other choices either mismatch the position numbers, product names, or tautomeric forms. Therefore, the final decision is that choice A is the correct matching set of products and reactants.
