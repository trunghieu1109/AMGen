From Sub-task 1.5 we know the electric dipole moment vanishes. By similar symmetry arguments: 1) The magnetic dipole moment vanishes because there is no net circulating current; 2) All odd electric multipoles (dipole, octupole, …) vanish under inversion symmetry; 3) The leading nonzero term is the electric quadrupole tensor, which for an axisymmetric spheroid has a time‐varying Qzz component. Hence the electric quadrupole term is the first nonzero radiation contribution.; answer: Electric quadrupole\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent xdZy, deriving pattern, thinking: For an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution the lowest nonzero term is the electric quadrupole (l=2, m=0).

In general, the power radiated by an electric multipole of order ℓ scales as ω^(2ℓ+2) (where ω is the angular frequency): for a dipole (ℓ=1) P∝ω^4, for a quadrupole (ℓ=2) P∝ω^6. Since ω=2πc/λ, this becomes P∝(1/λ)^6. Thus the radiated power per unit solid angle f∝λ^(-6).
