Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The radiation pattern for a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution in the dipole approximation follows f(θ)∝sin²θ, giving f(30°)/f_max = sin²30° = (1/2)² = 1/4. Dipole radiation power scales as ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴. Among the given options, only choice 3 corresponds to (1/4, λ⁻⁴), which is labeled C).

proposed answer: From Sub-task 4 the normalized angular factor at θ=30° is f(30°)=sin²(2·30°)=sin²60°=3/4. From Sub-task 5 the quadrupole radiation scales as ω⁶∝λ⁻⁶. Combining these gives a fraction 3/4 with λ⁻⁶ dependence, matching choice B).
