It is derived under the assumption that the device is a trap-free, single-carrier system with no carrier injection barrier. This means that the contacts are Ohmic, allowing for easy injection of carriers without any energy barrier. Additionally, the equation assumes that the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current, which is the current due to the electric field.

The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the device is a trap-free, single-carrier system with Ohmic contacts, which implies no carrier injection barrier. The assumption of negligible diffusion current is also part of the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.

The statement in choice 2 claims that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a device with negligible drift current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current, which is a drift current due to the electric field. In the SCLC regime, the drift current is the dominant current, not negligible.

This is a fundamental assumption for the validity of the equation. The presence of two types of carriers would introduce additional complexities such as recombination and interactions between the carriers, which are not accounted for in the Mott-Gurney model. Therefore, the statement 'The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.' is false because it contradicts the single-carrier assumption of the Mott-Gurney equation.
