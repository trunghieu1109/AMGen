It assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device where the current is dominated by drift under an applied voltage, with negligible diffusion current. The contacts are assumed to be Ohmic to allow for efficient carrier injection without barriers.

These conditions ensure that the space-charge-limited current behavior is accurately described by the equation. Therefore, the key conditions required are a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent F8Jc, identifying validity conditions of Mott-Gurney equation, thinking: The Mott-Gurney equation assumes a trap-free material, single-carrier transport, Ohmic contacts (which provide no injection barrier), and that the current is dominated by drift rather than diffusion. These conditions ensure that the space-charge-limited current behavior described by the equation is valid. The equation does not hold if there are traps, if there are significant diffusion currents, or if the contacts are Schottky (which introduce barriers). Thus, the key conditions are trap-free single-carrier device, Ohmic contacts, and negligible diffusion current.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent wvEU, identifying validity conditions of Mott-Gurney equation, thinking: The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumptions that the device is trap-free, operates with single-carrier transport, has Ohmic contacts (meaning no injection barrier), and that the current is dominated by drift rather than diffusion. Trap-free means there are no traps capturing carriers, which would alter the current-voltage relation.
