Among the options, only Choice A matches these assumptions.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent QbL1, listing assumptions, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law J = (9/8)εμV²/L³ is derived under very specific conditions.  First, it assumes a trap‐free material so that all injected carriers contribute to current without being captured.  Second, only one type of carrier (electrons or holes) is present (unipolar conduction), so there is no ambipolar transport or recombination.  Third, contacts are Ohmic, meaning there is no injection barrier and the carrier density at the injecting electrode is high enough to establish space‐charge‐limited flow.  Fourth, drift current dominates over diffusion current, allowing the neglect of concentration gradients and diffusion.  Fifth, the mobility μ is field‐independent and uniform throughout the device.  Finally, the device is treated as one‐dimensional with a uniform dielectric constant, steady state conditions, and no significant trap or recombination effects.; answer: Trap-free semiconductor; single‐carrier (unipolar) conduction; Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier); negligible diffusion current (drift-limited); constant, field-independent mobility; one-dimensional device with uniform dielectric and steady-state conditions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent uUfm, evaluating Choice 1, thinking: Choice A specifies a trap‐free, single‐carrier device with no injection barrier (i.e., an Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.
