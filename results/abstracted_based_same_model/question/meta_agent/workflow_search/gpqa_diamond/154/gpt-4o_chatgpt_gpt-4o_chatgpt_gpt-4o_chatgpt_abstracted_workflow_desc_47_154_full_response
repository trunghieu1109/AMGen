The expectation value of P_z squared is given by the expression ⟨ψ|P_z^2|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector. This can be calculated as the dot product of the conjugate transpose of the state vector with the result of P_z^2 acting on the state vector. The conjugate transpose of the state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), since the vector is real. P_z^2 acting on the state vector gives (ℏ^2 * (-1/2), 0, ℏ^2 * (-1/2)) = (-ℏ^2/2, 0, -ℏ^2/2). The dot product is (-1/2)*(-ℏ^2/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ℏ^2/2) = ℏ^2/4 + ℏ^2/4 = ℏ^2/2.
