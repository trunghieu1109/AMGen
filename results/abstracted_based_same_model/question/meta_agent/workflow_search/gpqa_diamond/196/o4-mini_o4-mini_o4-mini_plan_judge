Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The HI/red P reduction of the carboxyl group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid converts the –COOH into a methyl group without altering the sec-butyl substituent at the para position. This yields a benzene ring bearing a methyl at C1 and a sec-butyl at C4, which matches exactly the structure of 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Among the given options, that is choice A.
