proposed answer: The reaction of Compound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid based on the IR and NMR data, with red phosphorus and HI is a well-known reduction process that converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH3). This reaction effectively removes the acidic functionality and replaces it with a hydrogen atom, resulting in an alkyl-substituted benzene derivative. Since the sec-butyl group remains unchanged at the para position, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This conclusion is supported by the consistent reasoning from multiple expert agents and aligns with the known chemical reaction mechanism.
