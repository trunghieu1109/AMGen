Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_168
proposed answer: The original decay 2A→2B+2E+2V has four light final‐state particles sharing the available energy, yielding a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles. The variant replaces two V’s with a single massless M, reducing the multiplicity to three (2E+M). A three‐body (or higher) final state still permits a continuous distribution of energy between the products, so the spectrum remains continuous. Furthermore, removing two light but massive V’s leaves less rest mass to accommodate, allowing the E particles to carry away more kinetic energy at maximum. Hence the spectral endpoint shifts upward. These conclusions map directly to choice C).
