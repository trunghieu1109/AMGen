Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the two neutrinos (V) can carry away varying amounts of energy, resulting in a range of possible energies for the E particles. The endpoint Q represents the maximum energy the E particles can have when the neutrinos take minimal energy. In the variant decay, where the 2V is replaced by one massless particle M, the energy distribution remains continuous because M, being massless, can still take a range of energies. However, the shape of the spectrum changes because there is one less particle sharing the energy, potentially allowing the E particles to have more energy. Thus, the endpoint energy of the E particles increases. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. All agents agree on this analysis, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is C).
