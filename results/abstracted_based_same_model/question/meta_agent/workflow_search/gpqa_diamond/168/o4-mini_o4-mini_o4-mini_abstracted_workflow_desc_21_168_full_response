In an n‐body final state, the continuous energy distribution of one particle arises from the many ways to share the fixed Q‐value among the other particles, with the endpoint corresponding to the configuration where all other particles carry minimal kinetic energy. Thus the spectrum depends directly on the number of particles and their masses via the available phase‐space volume (Fermi’s Golden Rule).; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yhvd, analyzing kinematic principle, thinking: The key principle is that in multi-body decays the energy spectrum of any one emitted particle is governed by overall energy–momentum conservation and the available phase‐space volume. The continuous shape arises because the remaining energy can be shared in a continuum among the other particles. The spectrum endpoint is fixed by the total Q‐value minus the sum of the rest‐masses of all other final‐state particles. For an n‐body decay the differential rate scales with the phase‐space factor ∝(Q−E)^{n−2}, producing a continuous distribution whose endpoint sits at Q minus the masses of the undetected products.; answer: Energy–momentum conservation and multi‐body phase‐space: the spectrum’s continuous shape comes from the available phase‐space factor ∝(Q−E)^{n−2}, and the endpoint is set by the Q‐value minus the sum of the other particles’ rest masses.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent q9pQ, analyzing kinematic principle, thinking: The kinematic principle controlling beta‐type spectra is the available phase‐space for the final‐state particles together with energy–momentum conservation.  In a decay with n final particles, the differential decay rate is proportional to the phase‐space volume element ∏i d^3p_i/(2E_i) times a delta‐function enforcing total four‐momentum conservation.  When n≥3 this leads to a continuous lepton energy spectrum whose shape near the endpoint is governed by the factor (Q–E)^{n−2} (for light particles) and whose endpoint is fixed by the total Q‐value minus the sum of final‐state masses (and recoil energy).  In contrast, n=2 gives a discrete line because energy and momentum uniquely fix the two energies.; answer: The spectrum is governed by energy–momentum conservation and the phase‐space volume of the final state: for a three‐body decay the differential rate ∝phase‐space ∝E_e\u2009p_e\u2009(Q−E_e)^2, yielding a continuous spectrum with endpoint set by the Q‐value minus the masses.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent SLkv, comparing final states, thinking: We need to list the final‐state particles and their masses in each case. In the original decay there are two E particles (mass m_E each) plus two V particles (neutrino‐like with very small mass m_V≈0), for a total of four light particles. In the variant decay there are two E particles (m_E each) and one exotic M particle which is strictly massless, giving three light particles. This change reduces the total number of light particles by one and removes any neutrino‐like massive contributions.; answer: Original: 2 E (mass m_E each) + 2 V (mass m_V≈0); Variant: 2 E (mass m_E each) + 1 M (massless)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Z02G, round 0, analyzing degrees of freedom, thinking: Replacing two light V particles with a single massless M reduces the number of final‐state particles from four (2E+2V) to three (2E+M). Fewer particles means fewer ways to share the fixed Q‐value, so the phase‐space distribution remains continuous (three‐body decay) but shifts to allocate more energy to the E particles on average. Consequently, the maximum possible energy for the E spectrum (the endpoint) increases compared to the original. This matches the behavior of a continuous spectrum with an increased endpoint.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent LmRz, round 0, analyzing degrees of freedom, thinking: Replacing two neutrino‐like particles V (each with a tiny but nonzero mass) by a single strictly massless particle M reduces the number of independent momentum vectors by one. In an n-body decay the beta spectrum arises from the phase-space volume available for energy–momentum sharing. Going from four light products (2E + 2V) to three (2E + 1M) lowers the dimensionality of that phase space, so the spectrum is still continuous (since more than two bodies remain) but its shape changes because there are fewer ways to partition Q. Furthermore, with only one massless particle carrying away the recoil, the two E’s can jointly take a larger fraction of the available energy, pushing the endpoint above the original Q.; answer: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent biy2, round 0, analyzing degrees of freedom, thinking: In beta‐type decays the continuous spectrum of a single particle comes from sharing the fixed Q‐value among multiple final‐state particles. Going from 2E+2V (four light bodies) to 2E+1M (three bodies) still yields a continuous spectrum (phase‐space remains >2 bodies). With one fewer particle to carry energy, the maximum energy the E pair can take increases, so the endpoint rises.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent J45f, round 0, analyzing degrees of freedom, thinking: In the original decay there are four light final‐state particles (2\u2009E + 2\u2009V), each with three momentum degrees of freedom, giving 12 kinematic variables minus four conservation constraints (energy\u2009+\u20093 momentum)\u2009=\u20098 free parameters. Replacing the two V’s by one massless M reduces the final‐state count to three particles, so you now have 9 momentum variables minus four constraints\u2009=\u20095 free parameters. This lower phase‐space dimensionality still allows a continuous distribution for the E energies (because any nonzero number of spectators yields a continuum), but the density of states factor (∝(Q−E_total)^{n−2}) changes its exponent by one. Also, since M is strictly massless, none of the Q‐value is tied up as rest mass in the new spectator, so slightly more kinetic energy is available to the E’s, pushing their endpoint upward.; answer: Replacing two V’s with one massless M reduces the number of final‐state particles (and hence phase‐space dimensions) from four to three, retaining a continuous spectrum for the E’s but altering its shape (the spectral fall‐off near the endpoint is less steep) and slightly increasing the maximum E energy because the lone M carries no rest mass.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, finalizing analysis of degrees of freedom, thinking: Replacing two light neutrino-like particles V (each with tiny but nonzero mass) by a single strictly massless particle M reduces the final‐state count from four bodies (2E+2V) to three (2E+M).

There is no quantization of the outgoing E energies imposed by kinematics alone, so the spectrum remains continuous.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent EqAR, analyzing endpoint shift, thinking: In the original decay 2A→2B+2E+2V, the available Q‐value is shared among 4 outgoing particles (2E’s and 2V’s), each V carrying away nonzero rest energy. Replacing the two V’s by one mass‐zero M reduces the total final‐state rest mass. Energy conservation then mandates that the same Q is distributed among fewer hefty particles, so the E’s can receive more maximum kinetic energy. Thus the endpoint of the E spectrum shifts upward compared to the original decay.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 5k2G, analyzing endpoint shift, thinking: In replacing two light but massive neutrino-like particles with one strictly massless particle, the total available Q-value must still be shared among final states. With one fewer nonzero rest mass to accommodate, less energy is “locked up” in mass, leaving more kinetic energy available. Consequently, the maximum possible kinetic energy that the E particles can carry away (the spectral endpoint) is pushed higher. Thus, the endpoint increases.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent mjXW, analyzing endpoint shift, thinking: In replacing two light but massive neutrino‐like particles V with a single massless M, there is one fewer rest mass to carry away energy.
