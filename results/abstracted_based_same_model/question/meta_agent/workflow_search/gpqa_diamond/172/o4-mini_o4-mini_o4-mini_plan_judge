Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_172
proposed answer: Using Δp≈5.3×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s and v=2×10⁸ m/s, we get ΔE≈v·Δp≈(2×10⁸ m/s)×(5.3×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)=1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J, which is about 1.1×10⁻¹⁶ J. Among the options (~10⁻¹⁹, ~10⁻¹⁸, ~10⁻¹⁶, ~10⁻¹⁷ J), the closest is ~10⁻¹⁶ J.
