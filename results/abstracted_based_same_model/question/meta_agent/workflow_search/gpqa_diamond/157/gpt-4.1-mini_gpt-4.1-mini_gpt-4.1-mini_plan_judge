Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_24_157
proposed answer: All four debate agents agree that mutation Y, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, leads to the formation of nonfunctional dimers with the wild-type protein. This results in protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype, as the mutant protein interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein without causing its degradation or a gain-of-function. The consensus among the agents strongly supports choice B as the most likely molecular phenotype observed.
