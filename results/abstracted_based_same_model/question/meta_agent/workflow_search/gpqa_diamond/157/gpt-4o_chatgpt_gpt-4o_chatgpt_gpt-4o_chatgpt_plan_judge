Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_157
proposed answer: All agents agree that mutation Y, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, leads to the formation of non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype due to the interference of the mutant protein with the normal function of the wild-type protein. The scenario described by 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' aligns with the expected outcome of a dominant-negative mutation, where the mutant protein aggregates with the wild-type protein, causing a loss of function. Therefore, choice B) is the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y.
