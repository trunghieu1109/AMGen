Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: The task is to determine which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the assay of active chromatin in the shmoo of yeast. The shmoo formation is a transcriptional response, so we expect to see protein complexes involved in transcription, such as the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental part of chromatin structure and would also be present. The pre-replication complex, however, is involved in DNA replication, not transcription. Since the assay is focused on active chromatin in a transcriptional context, proteins from the pre-replication complex are least likely to be observed. All agents agree on this reasoning.
