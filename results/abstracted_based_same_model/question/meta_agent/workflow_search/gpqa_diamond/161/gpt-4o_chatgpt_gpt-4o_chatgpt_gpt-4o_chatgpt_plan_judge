proposed answer: The problem involves determining the area of a pseudosphere using a given metric. The metric describes a hyperbolic plane, and for a hyperbolic plane, the area is infinite for any finite radius. The sub-task analyses concluded that the area for radius r=2 is +∞. Among the provided choices, A) +∞ matches the calculated area. The other choices involve expressions that do not represent the area of a hyperbolic plane or are not infinite, making them incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A).
