The integral for the total area is A = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^2 (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dθ. The integrand has a singularity at r=2 because the denominator 4 - r^2 = 0 there, making the integrand diverge to infinity. Evaluating the integral explicitly shows the integral diverges (the integral near r=2 behaves like ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r^2) which diverges). Hence, the total area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 is infinite.

The total area A is then the double integral over the disk of radius 2: A = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dθ. Evaluating the inner integral: ∫₀^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr. Substitute u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2. The integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^{0} (32 * (-du/2)) / u = -16 ∫_4^0 du / u = 16 ∫_0^4 (1/u) du = 16 [ln|u|]_0^4 = 16 (ln 4 - ln 0). The term ln 0 is divergent to -∞, so the integral diverges to +∞. Hence, the area is infinite.
