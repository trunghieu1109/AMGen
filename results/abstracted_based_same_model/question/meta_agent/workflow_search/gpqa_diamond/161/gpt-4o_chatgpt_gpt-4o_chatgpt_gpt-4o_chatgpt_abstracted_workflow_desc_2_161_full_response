The metric is defined for 4-x^2-y^2 > 0, meaning it is valid inside a circle of radius 2. The area element for this metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy, which is \\sqrt{g} dx dy where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Here, the metric tensor is g_{ij} = \\frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)} \\delta_{ij}, so its determinant is \\left(\\frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}\\right)^2. The area element is then \\frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)} dx dy.
