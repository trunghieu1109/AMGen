Substituting phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we have |psi> = (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). The density matrix rho is then rho = (|psi><psi|), which involves taking the outer product of |psi> with itself. This results in a 2x2 matrix in the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>}.

For a coherent state |alpha>, the first moments are <X> = sqrt(2) * Re(alpha) and <P> = sqrt(2) * Im(alpha). The second moments are related to the variances, which for a coherent state are 1/2 in both quadratures. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so we need to compute the expectation values for this superposition. The first moment <X> for |psi> is given by <psi|X|psi>, which involves terms like <alpha|X|alpha> and <-alpha|X|-alpha>, as well as cross terms <alpha|X|-alpha> and <-alpha|X|alpha>.

The reference Gaussian state tau will have the same mean position and momentum as |psi> and the same variances in the quadratures. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is then computed using these moments.

To compute the entropy, we need to diagonalize rho to find its eigenvalues, as the entropy is the sum of -lambda_i * ln(lambda_i) over all eigenvalues lambda_i of rho.

The reference Gaussian state tau is typically a thermal state or a coherent state with the same mean and variance as rho.
