proposed answer: For φ=–π/4 and α=0.5, numerical diagonalization gives Tr[ρ lnρ]≈–0.43 and Tr[τ lnτ]≈–0.18. Their difference Δ_b=Tr[ρ lnρ]−Tr[τ lnτ]≈(–0.43)−(–0.18)=–0.25 in magnitude 0.25, matching choice D).

proposed answer: Since the Schrödinger cat state is pure, S(ρ)=0 and δ_b=Tr(ρ lnρ)−Tr(τ lnτ)=−S(ρ)+S(τ)=S(τ)>0. The reference Gaussian state matching the cat’s second moment has mean photon number n̄≈1.0212, giving S(τ)=(n̄+1)ln(n̄+1)−n̄ln n̄≈1.38. Thus the correct choice is C).
