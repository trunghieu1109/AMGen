The 13 particles each have a charge of 2e, and 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 m from a point P, where the 13th charge is fixed. This suggests a geometric arrangement where the 12 charges are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m centered at P. The electrostatic potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since the charges are identical and the distances are specified, we can calculate the potential energy using Coulomb's law. The potential energy between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. In this problem, we need to consider the potential energy between the 13th charge at P and each of the 12 charges on the sphere, as well as the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges on the sphere. This requires understanding the geometry of the arrangement and applying the formula for potential energy to each pair of charges.; answer - The physical principles involved are electrostatic potential energy and the geometric arrangement of charges on a sphere.

Here, q1 and q2 are the charges, each with charge 2e, and r is the distance between them, which is 2 m. Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2. The charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C, so each charge is 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C. The potential energy between the 13th charge and one of the 12 charges is: U_single = (8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (3.204 x 10^-19 C)^2 / 2 m. Calculating this gives U_single = (8.9875 x 10^9) * (1.026 x 10^-37) / 2 = 4.613 x 10^-27 J. Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy is 12 * U_single = 12 * 4.613 x 10^-27 J = 5.536 x 10^-26 J.

For a sphere of radius R, the edge length is given by the formula: edge length = sqrt(2 - 2 * cos(2 * pi / 5)) * R. For R = 2 m, this gives the edge length between adjacent charges.

In this problem, each charge is 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 C). The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 m from P. Thus, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges is U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 m = k * (4e^2) / 2 = 2k * e^2. Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges is U_total = 12 * (2k * e^2) = 24k * e^2. Substituting the values of k and e, we get U_total = 24 * (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2.
