Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_179
proposed answer: We sum the Coulomb potential energy for 13 charges (q=2e) with k=8.99×10⁹ N·m²/C². Twelve charges sit at the vertices of a regular icosahedron of radius 2 m, and one at the center. The central–shell interactions: 12 pairs at r=2 m give U_center = 12·k·q²/2 ≃0.554×10⁻²⁶ J. Shell–shell interactions: 30 edges at ≃2.103 m, 30 next‐neighbors at ≃2.351 m, and 6 diametrically opposite at 4 m sum to U_shell ≃5.09×10⁻²⁶ J. Total U ≃5.645×10⁻²⁶ J, matching choice B.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_179
proposed answer: Summing the Coulomb interactions for the 13 charges (12 on a radius‐2 m icosahedron plus one at the center) gives total U≈2.822×10⁻²⁶ J. This matches choice A).
