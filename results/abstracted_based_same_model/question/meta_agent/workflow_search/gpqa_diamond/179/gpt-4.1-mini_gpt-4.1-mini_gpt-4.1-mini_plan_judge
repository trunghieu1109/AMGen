Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_179
proposed answer: The calculated minimum electrostatic potential energy is approximately 3.374 x 10^-26 Joules. Among the given options, choice A) 2.822 x 10^-26 is the closest to this value. The other options are either significantly smaller or larger by orders of magnitude, making them unsuitable. Therefore, the correct answer choice that best matches the calculated minimum energy is A).
