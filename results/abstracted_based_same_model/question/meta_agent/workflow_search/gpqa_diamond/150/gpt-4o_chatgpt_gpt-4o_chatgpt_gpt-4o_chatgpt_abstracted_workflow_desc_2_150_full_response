It is a 3x3 matrix with the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). This matrix represents the observable of the system.; answer - The matrix operator P is:\n[ [0, 1/√2, 0],\n  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix operator P, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The matrix P is given by: P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. Subtracting λI from P gives: [[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]. The determinant of this matrix is calculated as follows: det(P - λI) = -λ(-λ^2 + 1/2) - (1/√2)(1/√2 * -λ - 0) = -λ(-λ^2 + 1/2) + 1/2λ = λ^3 - 1/2λ - 1/2λ = λ^3 - λ. Setting this equal to 0 gives the characteristic equation: λ(λ^2 - 1) = 0. The solutions are λ = 0 and λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of P are λ = 0, 1, -1. To find the eigenvectors, we solve (P - λI)x = 0 for each eigenvalue. For λ = 0: (P - 0I)x = Px = 0. This gives the system of equations: 1/√2 x_2 = 0, 1/√2 x_1 + 1/√2 x_3 = 0, 1/√2 x_2 = 0. The solution is x_2 = 0, x_1 = -x_3. A possible eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). For λ = 1: (P - I)x = 0, giving: -x_1 + 1/√2 x_2 = 0, 1/√2 x_1 - x_2 + 1/√2 x_3 = 0, 1/√2 x_2 - x_3 = 0. Solving this gives x_1 = x_3, x_2 = √2 x_1. A possible eigenvector is (1, √2, 1). For λ = -1: (P + I)x = 0, giving: x_1 + 1/√2 x_2 = 0, 1/√2 x_1 + x_2 + 1/√2 x_3 = 0, 1/√2 x_2 + x_3 = 0. Solving this gives x_1 = -x_3, x_2 = √2 x_3. A possible eigenvector is (1, -√2, -1). Therefore, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1 are (1, 0, -1), (1, √2, 1), and (1, -√2, -1), respectively. These eigenvectors represent the possible states of the system after measurement, and the eigenvalues represent the possible measurement outcomes.; answer - (1, 0, -1), (1, √2, 1), (1, -√2, -1) are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1, respectively.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From the previous sub-task, we have determined the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of the matrix operator P. The eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1).

The state vector is (-1, 2, 1) and the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). The dot product of these vectors is (-1)*1 + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 - 1 = -2. The magnitude of the eigenvector (1, 0, -1) is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).

The correct probability amplitude is (-2/sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) = -sqrt(2/6) = -sqrt(1/3). The magnitude of this is sqrt(1/3), and squaring it gives 1/3.

The matrix P is given by: P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. Subtracting λI from P gives: [[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]. The determinant of this matrix is calculated as follows: det(P - λI) = -λ(-λ^2 + 1/2) - (1/√2)(1/√2 * -λ - 0) = -λ(-λ^2 + 1/2) + 1/2λ = λ^3 - 1/2λ - 1/2λ = λ^3 - λ. Setting this equal to 0 gives the characteristic equation: λ(λ^2 - 1) = 0. The solutions are λ = 0 and λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of P are λ = 0, 1, -1. To find the eigenvectors, we solve (P - λI)x = 0 for each eigenvalue. For λ = 0: (P - 0I)x = Px = 0. This gives the system of equations: 1/√2 x_2 = 0, 1/√2 x_1 + 1/√2 x_3 = 0, 1/√2 x_2 = 0. The solution is x_2 = 0, x_1 = -x_3. A possible eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). For λ = 1: (P - I)x = 0, giving: -x_1 + 1/√2 x_2 = 0, 1/√2 x_1 - x_2 + 1/√2 x_3 = 0, 1/√2 x_2 - x_3 = 0. Solving this gives x_1 = x_3, x_2 = √2 x_1. A possible eigenvector is (1, √2, 1). For λ = -1: (P + I)x = 0, giving: x_1 + 1/√2 x_2 = 0, 1/√2 x_1 + x_2 + 1/√2 x_3 = 0, 1/√2 x_2 + x_3 = 0. Solving this gives x_1 = -x_3, x_2 = √2 x_3. A possible eigenvector is (1, -√2, -1).

For λ2 = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, leading to the eigenvector v = (0, 1, 0).
