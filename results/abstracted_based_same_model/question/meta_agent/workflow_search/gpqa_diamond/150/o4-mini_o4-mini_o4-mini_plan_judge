Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: First we normalize the initial state ψ=(–1,2,1). Its norm is √[1+4+1]=√6, so |ψ⟩=(–1/√6,2/√6,1/√6). The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |φ⟩=(1/√2,0,–1/√2). Compute the inner product ⟨φ|ψ⟩=(1/√2)(–1/√6)+0·(2/√6)+(–1/√2)(1/√6)=–2/(√2√6)=–1/√3. The probability is |–1/√3|²=1/3, corresponding to choice A).
