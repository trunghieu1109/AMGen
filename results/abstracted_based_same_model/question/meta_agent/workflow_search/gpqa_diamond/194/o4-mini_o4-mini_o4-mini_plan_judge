Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_194
proposed answer: Given a2_max ≃0.2316 AU (imposed by requiring both transit and occultation) and assuming the star’s mass ≃1.5 M⊙, we apply Kepler’s third law in units where P^2 (yr^2) = a^3 (AU^3) / M★ (M⊙). Thus P = √(0.2316^3 / 1.5) ≃ √(0.01242 / 1.5) ≃ √0.00828 ≃ 0.0910 yr ≃ 33.2 days. The closest listed choice is ~33.5 days.
