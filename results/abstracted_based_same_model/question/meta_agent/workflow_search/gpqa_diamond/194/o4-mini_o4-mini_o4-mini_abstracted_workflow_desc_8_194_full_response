We have a2_max ≃0.2316\u2009AU and assume M★≈1.5\u2009M⊙ (since R★=1.5\u2009R⊙ for a main‐sequence star). Then P2_years = sqrt(0.2316^3/1.5) = sqrt(0.01241/1.5) ≃sqrt(0.00827)=0.0909\u2009yr. Converting to days: 0.0909×365.25 ≃33.2\u2009days, which matches choice ~33.5\u2009days.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent vQI8:\nWe have a2_max ≃0.2316\u2009AU. By Kepler’s third law P^2= a^3/M⋆ (with P in years, a in AU, M⋆ in M⊙).

We found a2_max ≈ 0.2316 AU. Assuming the star’s mass scales with its radius (M* ≈1.5 M☉), P2 ≈ sqrt(0.2316^3 / 1.5) ≈ sqrt(0.01242 / 1.5) ≈ sqrt(0.00828) ≈0.0910 years, or ≈33.2 days.
