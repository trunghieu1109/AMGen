It treats the spring as rigid and ignores relativistic corrections to force transmission, spring‐constant changes at high strain, and electromagnetic (or other) radiation from an accelerating charge. It also requires kA²/(2mc²)>0 but not so large that the spring would plastically deform or the potential energy exceeds the rest energy of the mass. If kA²/(2mc²)≫1, structural limits or non‐Hookean behavior will invalidate the result.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Express v_max by converting gamma to v via v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) and simplify the expression for direct comparison.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
