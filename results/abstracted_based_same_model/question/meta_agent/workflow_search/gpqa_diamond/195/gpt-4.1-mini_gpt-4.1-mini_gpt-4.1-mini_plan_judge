proposed answer: The maximum speed v_max of a relativistic harmonic oscillator must respect the relativistic speed limit, i.e., it must be less than the speed of light c. The derived formula from relativistic energy conservation and velocity relations is v_max = c * sqrt{1 - 1 / [1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2)]^2}. This formula ensures that v_max < c and correctly incorporates the relativistic corrections to the classical harmonic oscillator. Among the given options, only choice B matches this exact formula. Choices A and C have incorrect forms inside the square root, and choice D corresponds to the classical maximum speed without relativistic corrections. Therefore, choice B is the correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.
