First compute the base phenyl–bromine fragment C6H4Br: 6×12.01 + 4×1.008 + 79.904 = 155.996 g/mol.

Electron-withdrawing meta-directors (–NO2, –COOR, –COOH) give lower para yields than weakly deactivating (–Cl) or activating groups (–CH3, –C2H5). The correct order is 4<2<6<3<1<5, corresponding to choice B.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 3kcH, MW calculation thinking: The para‐isomer weight fraction equals the molar para fraction (since o/p isomers have the same MW). Meta‐directors (NO2, COOH, COOC2H5) give essentially zero para. Among ortho/para directors, CH3 activates less than C2H5, and halogen directs most para.

The mass of the para isomer is P%·MW. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para isomer = (P%·MW)/(100%·MW) = P%/100. Using the verified para percentages from Sub-task 4: (1) 37% → 0.37; (2) 5% → 0.05; (3) 53% → 0.53; (4) 4% → 0.04; (5) 45% → 0.45; (6) 8% → 0.08.; answer: 1) 0.37; 2) 0.05; 3) 0.53; 4) 0.04; 5) 0.45; 6) 0.08\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent oME6, round 0, weight fraction thinking: We have for each substituent R percentages of ortho (O), meta (M), and para (P) isomers by mole: O+M+P=100. All positional isomers have identical molecular weights (MW), so the weight contribution of each isomer is proportional to its mole fraction times MW. Thus the weight fraction of the para isomer is:\n\nweight_frac_para = (P% × MW_para) / [O% × MW_ortho + M% × MW_meta + P% × MW_para] \n                      = (P% × MW) / [100% × MW] \n                      = P% / 100%.\n\nUsing the verified P values for substituents 1–6:\n1) –CH₃: P=37% → 0.37\n2) –COOC₂H₅: P=5% → 0.05\n3) –Cl: P=53% → 0.53\n4) –NO₂: P=4% → 0.04\n5) –C₂H₅: P=45% → 0.45\n6) –COOH: P=8% → 0.08; answer: Substituent 1 (–CH₃): 0.37; 2 (–COOC₂H₅): 0.05; 3 (–Cl): 0.53; 4 (–NO₂): 0.04; 5 (–C₂H₅): 0.45; 6 (–COOH): 0.08\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent L85d, round 0, weight fraction thinking: Each ortho, meta, and para isomer of a given substituent has the same molecular weight, so\n weight_para\u2009/\u2009( O·mW_o + M·mW_m + P·mW_p ) = (P%·mW)/( (O%+M%+P%)·mW ) = P%/100.

Let O, M and P be the percentages of ortho, meta and para products (summing to 100%), and MW be the common molecular weight of the isomers. The weight fraction of the para isomer is:\n\nweight_para = (P/100 × MW) / [(O/100 × MW) + (M/100 × MW) + (P/100 × MW)]\n             = P/100 × MW / [100/100 × MW]\n             = P/100.\n\nThus for each substituent the weight fraction equals the para percentage divided by 100:\n1) R=–CH₃: P=37% → 0.37\n2) R=–COOC₂H₅: P=5% → 0.05\n3) R=–Cl: P=53% → 0.53\n4) R=–NO₂: P=4% → 0.04\n5) R=–C₂H₅: P=45% → 0.45\n6) R=–COOH: P=8% → 0.08; answer: 1) 0.37; 2) 0.05; 3) 0.53; 4) 0.04; 5) 0.45; 6) 0.08\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent 076Y, weight fraction final thinking: All ortho, meta, and para bromo isomers of a given substituted benzene have identical molecular weights.

Sub‐task 6a used the verified para percentages directly to calculate weight fractions (e.g., 37% → 0.37, 5% → 0.05, etc.). No additional data from the O or M isomers is needed, since they do not affect the weight fraction calculation for P. Therefore the calculations in 6a correctly used the full O:M:P data and there are no discrepancies.; answer: No discrepancies; the weight fractions are correct.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent VvS9, feedback thinking: Yes. Since all isomers have equal molar mass, using the percentage of the para isomer directly (P%/100) gives its weight fraction. The ortho and meta percentages don’t change the calculation for the para weight fraction because they cancel out in the denominator when converting to a fraction of the total. Hence the weight‐fraction calculation correctly incorporates O, M, and P data.; answer: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent chZY, sorting thinking: Para‐isomer weight fraction = P%/100. Strongly deactivating meta directors give very low P, while strongly activating ortho/para directors give high P. Nitrobenzene (4) has the smallest P, then ethyl benzoate (2), benzoic acid (6), then chlorobenzene (3), toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5) give the highest.
