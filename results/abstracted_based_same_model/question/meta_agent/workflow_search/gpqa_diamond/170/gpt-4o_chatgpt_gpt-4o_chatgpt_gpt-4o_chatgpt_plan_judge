proposed answer: The order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effects and reactivity of the substituents on the benzene ring. Ortho/para directors such as CH3, Cl, and C2H5 will favor the formation of para-isomers more than meta directors like COOC2H5, NO2, and COOH. The reactivity order based on the substituents is: 5 (C2H5) > 1 (CH3) > 3 (Cl) > 2 (COOC2H5) > 6 (COOH) > 4 (NO2). Therefore, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This matches choice 2.

proposed answer: The task is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer. Based on the directing effects and reactivity of the substituents, ortho/para directors like CH3 and C2H5 have higher para fractions due to their activating nature, while meta directors like NO2, COOC2H5, and COOH have lower para fractions due to their deactivating nature. The reactivity order further supports this arrangement, with C2H5 being the most reactive and NO2 being the least. Therefore, the consensus order is 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This matches choice 2.
