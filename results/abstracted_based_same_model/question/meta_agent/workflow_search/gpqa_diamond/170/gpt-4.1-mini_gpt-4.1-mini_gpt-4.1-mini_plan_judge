Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_170
proposed answer: The ranking order obtained from sub-task 4 is NO2 (4) < COOH (6) < COOC2H5 (2) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5) < Cl (3). This order reflects the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in electrophilic substitution reactions. Comparing this order with the given multiple-choice options, only choice D (4<6<2<1<5<3) matches exactly. The other options do not correspond to this sequence. Therefore, the correct alphabetical choice is D.

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 4
