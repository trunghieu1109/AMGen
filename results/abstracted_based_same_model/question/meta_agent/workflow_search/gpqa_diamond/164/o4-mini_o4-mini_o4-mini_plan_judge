Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Among the four statements, only statement C accurately describes a known homogeneous tandem catalyst approach for producing regularly branched polyethylene using ethylene alone. In such systems, a group VIa transition metal complex (for example, Cr or Mo) is paired with a non-aluminum activator (e.g. perfluoroaryl borate) to oligomerize ethylene in situ into α-olefins. A second catalyst then incorporates these α-olefins as regular side‐chains during polymerization. Statement A is incorrect because no homogeneous dual catalyst plant exists at industrial scale in the US. Statement B is false since aluminum activators (like MAO) are not required for the key branching step; non-Al activators are in fact essential. Statement D is misleading: noble metals are generally neither selective enough nor economically viable for this purpose. Thus, C) is the correct choice.
