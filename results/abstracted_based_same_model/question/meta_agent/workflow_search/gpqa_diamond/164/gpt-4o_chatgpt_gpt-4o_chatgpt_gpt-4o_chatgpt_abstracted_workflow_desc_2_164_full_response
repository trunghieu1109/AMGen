The primary catalyst system, often a homogeneous organometallic catalyst, is responsible for the polymerization of ethylene to form a high-density polymer. To introduce regular branches, a second catalyst system is required. This second system must facilitate the incorporation of branches by enabling chain transfer or copolymerization processes. The activators are essential for activating the catalyst systems, often by forming active sites or facilitating the necessary chemical transformations. Aluminum-based activators are commonly used in Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysis, but the statement suggests they do not work for the additional reaction step needed for branching. This implies that a different type of activator is required for the second catalyst system to introduce branches. Group VIa transition metals, such as chromium, are known for their use in certain polymerization processes, but their role in branching with ethylene alone is less common. Noble metal catalysts, while effective, are often cost-prohibitive for industrial applications.

The statement 'Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step' is relevant because it highlights the need for a different type of activator for the branching process, which aligns with the requirement that aluminum-based activators are not suitable for this step. The statement 'Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US' is relevant if such systems indeed exist, indicating feasibility. However, it doesn't directly address the catalyst or activator requirements. The statement 'One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators' is relevant if such metals and activators facilitate branching, but the role of group VIa metals in branching with ethylene alone is less common. The statement 'Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive' might be relevant in terms of feasibility but does not directly address the technical requirements.

The statement 'Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step' aligns with this requirement, as it indicates the need for a different activator for the branching reaction. The other statements address different aspects: the industrial implementation of such systems (choice 1), the use of group VIa transition metals (choice 3), and the cost of noble metal catalysts (choice 4). However, none of these directly address the specific need for an alternative activator for branching.
