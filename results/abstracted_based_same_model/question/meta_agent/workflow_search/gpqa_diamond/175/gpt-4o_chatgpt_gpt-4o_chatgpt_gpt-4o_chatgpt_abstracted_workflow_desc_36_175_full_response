The operator P is given by the matrix:\n\nP = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. After calculating the eigenvalues of P, we find that 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. We then find the eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue.\n\nThe eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 are found by solving the equation (P - 0I)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector. Solving this, we find that the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 form a subspace spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).\n\nNext, we need to project the initial state vector (-1, 2, 1) onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The projection of a vector u onto a vector v is given by (u . v / v . v) v.\n\nLet v = (1, 0, -1). The projection of (-1, 2, 1) onto (1, 0, -1) is:\n\n((-1, 2, 1) . (1, 0, -1) / (1, 0, -1) .
