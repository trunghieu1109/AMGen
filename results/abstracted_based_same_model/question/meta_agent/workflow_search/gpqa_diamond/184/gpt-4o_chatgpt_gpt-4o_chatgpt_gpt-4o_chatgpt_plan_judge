Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator H = ε \vec{σ}.\vec{n} has eigenvalues that are determined by the properties of the Pauli matrices and the unit vector \vec{n}. The operator \vec{σ}.\vec{n} has eigenvalues +1 and -1, which are well-known properties of Pauli matrices. Since the Hamiltonian is ε times this operator, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ε times the eigenvalues of \vec{σ}.\vec{n}, resulting in +ε and -ε. Comparing these derived eigenvalues with the provided choices, Choice 1 is '+ ε, -ε', which matches the derived eigenvalues. The other choices do not match the derived eigenvalues. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
