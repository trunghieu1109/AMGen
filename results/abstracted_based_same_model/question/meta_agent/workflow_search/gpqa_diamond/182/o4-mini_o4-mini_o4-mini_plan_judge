Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_182
proposed answer: The strong reducing action of red phosphorus and HI removes both the formyl (–CHO) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) functionalities, converting them into saturated alkyl groups, while the original cyclohexene double bond and ring still contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency. Counting one ring (1) plus one C=C double bond (1) plus one additional unsaturation equivalent from the vinyl group (1) gives a total IHD of 3. Among the options (A:1, B:3, C:0, D:5), the value 3 corresponds to choice B.
