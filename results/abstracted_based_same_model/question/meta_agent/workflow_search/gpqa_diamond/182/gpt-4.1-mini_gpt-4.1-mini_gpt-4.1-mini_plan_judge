Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_182
proposed answer: The original compound has an IHD of 5, contributed by one ring (1 IHD), two double bonds (one in the ring and one vinyl, 2 IHD), one aldehyde (1 IHD), and one carboxylic acid group (1 IHD). Upon reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to methyl groups, removing 2 IHD. The double bonds are hydrogenated, removing 2 more IHD. The ring remains intact, contributing 1 IHD. Therefore, the product's IHD is 1. Among the given choices (1, 3, 0, 5), the correct answer is 1, corresponding to choice A).
