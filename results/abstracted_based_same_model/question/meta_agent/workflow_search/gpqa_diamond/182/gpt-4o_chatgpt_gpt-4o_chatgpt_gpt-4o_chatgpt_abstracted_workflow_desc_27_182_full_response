Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce double bonds and other unsaturated groups. The formyl group (aldehyde) will be reduced to a methyl group. The vinyl group (an alkene) will be reduced to an ethyl group. The carboxylic acid group is typically reduced to a primary alcohol, but under these conditions, it can be further reduced to a methyl group. The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.

Therefore, the entire compound becomes a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two additional methyl groups and one ethyl group.

The original compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a formyl group, a vinyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and a cyclohexene ring. Under the reducing conditions of red phosphorus and excess HI, the formyl group is reduced to a methyl group, the vinyl group is reduced to an ethyl group, the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group, and the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring. This results in a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with two methyl groups and one ethyl group, which matches the structure of 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylcyclohexane. This structure is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds or rings that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD is calculated as the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. Since the product is fully saturated, the IHD is 0. This aligns with the understanding that all unsaturations in the original compound are reduced, leading to a saturated product. However, a limitation is that the reaction conditions and the specific behavior of red phosphorus and HI might lead to unexpected side reactions or rearrangements that are not considered in the proposed mechanism.
