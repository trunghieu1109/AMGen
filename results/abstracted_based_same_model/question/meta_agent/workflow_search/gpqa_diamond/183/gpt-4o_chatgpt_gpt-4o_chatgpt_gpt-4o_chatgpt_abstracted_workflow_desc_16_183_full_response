First, introduce the tert-butyl group using Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This will add the tert-butyl group to the benzene ring, which is ortho/para-directing. Next, the ethoxy group should be introduced. However, direct introduction of an ethoxy group is challenging; instead, we can introduce an ethoxide ion via nucleophilic aromatic substitution after converting a nitro group to an amino group and diazotizing it, which is not directly possible here. Instead, the ethoxy group can be introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis after introducing a hydroxyl group. Therefore, first introduce the nitro group using HNO3/H2SO4, which will go to the meta position relative to tert-butyl due to sterics, but can be controlled to be ortho/para with enough control. Finally, after reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, diazotization and substitution with ethoxide can introduce the ethoxy group.
