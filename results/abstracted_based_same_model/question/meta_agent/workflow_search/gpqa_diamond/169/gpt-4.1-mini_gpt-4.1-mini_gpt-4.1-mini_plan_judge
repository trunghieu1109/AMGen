Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_169
proposed answer: The normalized spin state vector is |psi> = (3i/5, 4/5)^T. Its conjugate transpose (bra) is <psi| = (-3i/5, 4/5). The intermediate vector from Sub-task 4 is (hbar/2)*(-4i/5, -3/5)^T. The expectation value <S_y> = <psi|S_y|psi> = (hbar/2) * [(-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)]. Calculating each term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = 12 * i^2 / 25 = 12 * (-1) / 25 = -12/25, and (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25. Summing these gives -24/25. Multiplying by (hbar/2) gives -12*hbar/25. Comparing with the given choices, this matches choice B). Therefore, the correct answer is B).
