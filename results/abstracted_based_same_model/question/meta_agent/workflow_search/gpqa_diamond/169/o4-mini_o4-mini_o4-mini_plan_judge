Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_169
proposed answer: We computed the normalized spinor ψ=(3i,4)/5 and applied S_y=(ħ/2)[[0,−i],[i,0]]. The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩=⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ yields −12ħ/25, which exactly matches choice B.
