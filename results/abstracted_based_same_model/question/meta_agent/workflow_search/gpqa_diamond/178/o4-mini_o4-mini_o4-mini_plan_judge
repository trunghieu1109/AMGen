proposed answer: Based on subtasks 6–9: Statement A is false since X is not unitary and so cannot serve as an evolution operator. Statement B is true because X is not anti-Hermitian, making e^X nonunitary and thus capable of changing the norm of some vector. Statement C is false as conjugation by a nonunitary operator does not guarantee preservation of Hermiticity, so (e^X)Y(e^{-X}) need not represent a valid quantum state. Statement D is false because X is not Hermitian and therefore cannot represent an observable (even though Z is Hermitian). The only true statement is B.

proposed answer: Reviewing each statement: A requires both W and X to be unitary; W is unitary but X is not, so A is false. B claims e^X changes some vector’s norm, but since X†=–X, e^X is unitary and preserves all norms, so B is false. C states (e^X)Y(e^–X) is a valid quantum state; unitary conjugation preserves Hermiticity, positivity, and trace of the density matrix Y, so C is true. D requires Z and X both Hermitian; Z is Hermitian but X is not, so D is false. Therefore, the correct choice is C).
