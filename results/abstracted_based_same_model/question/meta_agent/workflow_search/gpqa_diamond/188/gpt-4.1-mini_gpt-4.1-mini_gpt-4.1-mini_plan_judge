Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: All four debate agents agree that magnons, pions, and phonons arise due to spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries, while skyrmions are topological solitons whose existence and stability are due to topological properties rather than spontaneous symmetry breaking. This consensus strongly supports that the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the skyrmion.
