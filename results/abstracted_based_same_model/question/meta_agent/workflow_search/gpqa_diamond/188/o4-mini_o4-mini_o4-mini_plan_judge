Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: Among the four options, magnons arise as Goldstone modes from broken spin‐rotation symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken translational symmetry in a lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons—not Goldstone bosons—and are not directly tied to a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. Therefore the correct choice is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
