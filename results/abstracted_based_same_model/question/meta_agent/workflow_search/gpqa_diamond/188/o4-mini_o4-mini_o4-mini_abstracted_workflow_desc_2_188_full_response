Continuous symmetries broken in this way produce gapless collective excitations—Goldstone bosons—which are low-energy fluctuations along the vacuum manifold. The criterion for an effective particle to be tied to a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry is that it must be a massless (or nearly massless) mode arising from small fluctuations around one of the degenerate vacua, i.e., a Goldstone boson. Magnons (spin waves) arise from broken spin-rotational symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal.

The underlying Hamiltonian is invariant under continuous rotations of all spins (an SU(2) or equivalently SO(3) spin‐rotation symmetry). In the ferromagnetic ground state this symmetry is spontaneously broken because the spins align along a particular axis, selecting one direction out of the continuum of possible orientations. Small fluctuations transverse to that axis cost little energy and manifest as gapless spin‐wave modes—magnons. Thus the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry giving rise to magnons is the global spin‐rotation symmetry.; answer - Spin‐rotational symmetry (SU(2)/SO(3))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3.2 output: thinking - Skyrmions arise in nonlinear sigma models describing pions as Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. In the Skyrme model one starts from the approximate SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry of QCD which is spontaneously broken down to the diagonal (vector) SU(2)_V subgroup. The vacuum manifold is then SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R/SU(2)_V≃SU(2)≃S^3, and stable topological solitons (skyrmions) appear because π_3(S^3)=ℤ.

The QCD vacuum, however, is not invariant under independent left- and right-handed rotations: it breaks SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R down to the diagonal vector subgroup SU(2)_V (isospin symmetry). Small fluctuations around this choice of vacuum correspond to the three pion fields. These pions are thus (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry.; answer - Spontaneously broken SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3.4 output: thinking - In a crystalline solid, atoms settle into a periodic lattice, choosing specific equilibrium positions. This ground state no longer shares the full continuous translational invariance of the underlying microscopic laws (which are the same under any arbitrary shift in space). The discrete lattice picks out preferred positions, thus spontaneously breaking the continuous spatial translation symmetry. Small oscillations of atoms around these equilibrium sites correspond to gapless modes (Goldstone bosons) of the broken symmetry, which are the phonons.; answer - Continuous translational symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Magnons, pions, and phonons are all Goldstone modes arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries (spin rotations, chiral SU(2)L×SU(2)R, and continuous translations, respectively).

In the ferromagnetic ground state this symmetry is spontaneously broken because the spins align along a particular axis, selecting one direction out of the continuum of possible orientations. Small fluctuations transverse to that axis cost little energy and manifest as gapless spin‐wave modes—magnons.

In the ordered phase, however, the spins pick out a particular direction to align along, so that ground state no longer shares the full spin‐rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Small fluctuations of the spins about this chosen direction are low‐energy modes (spin waves), and quantizing these fluctuations yields magnons. Thus magnons are the Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin‐rotational symmetry.; answer: Spin rotational symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qkBa, identify broken symmetry for magnons, thinking: Magnons are the gapless collective excitations (Goldstone modes) that arise when a continuous spin‐rotation symmetry of the magnetic Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken by the formation of long‐range magnetic order. In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, the underlying SU(2) (or its SO(3) subgroup) spin‐rotation invariance is broken when the spins align along a particular axis in space. Small transverse oscillations of the spins around this chosen axis correspond to magnons.; answer: Continuous spin‐rotational symmetry (SU(2) or SO(3))\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 8avu, identify broken symmetry for skyrmions, thinking: Skyrmions arise in nonlinear sigma models describing pions as Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. In the Skyrme model one starts from the approximate SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry of QCD which is spontaneously broken down to the diagonal (vector) SU(2)_V subgroup. The vacuum manifold is then SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R/SU(2)_V≃SU(2)≃S^3, and stable topological solitons (skyrmions) appear because π_3(S^3)=ℤ. No other continuous symmetry breaking gives the same nontrivial third homotopy group needed for skyrmions.; answer: SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R→SU(2)_V chiral symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 0p2J, identify broken symmetry for skyrmions, thinking: Skyrmions are topological solitons in a field whose vacuum manifold is the two‐sphere S^2 of possible spin orientations. This arises when the global spin‐rotation symmetry O(3) is spontaneously broken by magnetic order: the spins choose a particular direction in space, reducing O(3) down to the residual O(2) of rotations about that axis. The resulting manifold O(3)/O(2)≃S^2 supports nontrivial π2 homotopy and thus stable soliton configurations—skyrmions.; answer: O(3) spin rotational symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qkBa, identify broken symmetry for skyrmions, thinking: Skyrmions are topologically stable field configurations that arise because the vacuum manifold has nontrivial homotopy. In magnetic materials, the order parameter is the magnetization vector, and the system’s ground state spontaneously breaks the full spin‐rotation symmetry G=SO(3) (or SU(2)) down to the subgroup H=SO(2) of rotations about the magnetization axis. The resulting vacuum manifold G/H≃S^2 supports nontrivial π2(S^2)=ℤ, allowing for localized “twist” solutions—magnetic skyrmions. In the nuclear Skyrme model, similarly, the chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry is spontaneously broken to the vector SU(2)_V, giving a vacuum manifold SU(2)≃S^3 with π3(S^3)=ℤ and solitonic skyrmions. In both cases a continuous rotation symmetry (spin or chiral) is broken to a lower subgroup, enabling skyrmion textures.; answer: Spin‐rotation symmetry (SO(3)→SO(2))\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 8avu, identify broken symmetry for pions, thinking: In quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two light quark flavors (up and down), the Lagrangian exhibits an approximate global SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry. The QCD vacuum, however, is not invariant under independent left- and right-handed rotations: it breaks SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R down to the diagonal vector subgroup SU(2)_V (isospin symmetry). Small fluctuations around this choice of vacuum correspond to the three pion fields. These pions are thus (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry.; answer: Spontaneously broken SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 0p2J, identify broken symmetry for pions, thinking: In quantum chromodynamics with two light quark flavors, the approximate global symmetry under independent rotations of left- and right-handed quark fields is SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R. In the vacuum this symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the diagonal vector subgroup SU(2)_V (isospin symmetry). The resulting Goldstone bosons of this breaking are the three pions (π^+, π^0, π^-).; answer: SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R chiral symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qkBa, identify broken symmetry for pions, thinking: In quantum chromodynamics with two light quark flavors, the Lagrangian has an approximate global chiral symmetry SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R. The nonperturbative QCD vacuum develops a quark–antiquark condensate that is invariant only under the vector subgroup SU(2)_V, so the original SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_V. The three resulting Nambu–Goldstone bosons are identified with the pions.; answer: Approximately SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 8avu, identify broken symmetry for phonons, thinking: Phonons are the quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. A perfect crystal’s ground state does not look the same if you shift the entire crystal by a small arbitrary amount—its atomic positions are periodic, not continuously translation invariant. The underlying microscopic laws are invariant under continuous spatial translations, but the crystal’s discrete lattice picks out special positions, breaking that continuous translation symmetry down to a discrete subgroup. Small oscillations of atoms around their equilibrium lattice sites correspond to Goldstone modes of this broken continuous spatial translation symmetry. These modes are the phonons.; answer: Continuous translational symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 0p2J, identify broken symmetry for phonons, thinking: In a crystal, the atoms arrange themselves in a periodic lattice, so the full continuous translational invariance of space is lost—only discrete translations by lattice vectors remain. The low-energy collective excitations (phonons) correspond to long-wavelength fluctuations of the atomic positions along this vacuum manifold. According to Goldstone’s theorem, breaking a continuous symmetry (here continuous spatial translations) gives rise to gapless modes. Thus phonons are the Nambu–Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry.; answer: Continuous translational symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qkBa, identify broken symmetry for phonons, thinking: In a crystalline solid, atoms settle into a periodic lattice, choosing specific equilibrium positions.

The discrete lattice picks out preferred positions, thus spontaneously breaking the continuous spatial translation symmetry. Small oscillations of atoms around these equilibrium sites correspond to gapless modes (Goldstone bosons) of the broken symmetry, which are the phonons.; answer: Continuous translational symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent tmdc, comparing symmetries, thinking: Magnons arise from spontaneous breaking of spin‐rotational (SU(2)) symmetry; pions from chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R → SU(2)_V; phonons from broken continuous translational symmetry. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons in the nonlinear sigma model rather than Goldstone bosons of any spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. They owe their stability to the topology π_3(S^3), not a broken symmetry generator. Hence skyrmions are not themselves associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent okW7, feedback: The original comparison rightly identifies that magnons, pions, and phonons arise as Goldstone modes from continuous symmetry breaking, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons. Its limitations are:\n1. It treats skyrmions only as static solitons and neglects dynamical or emergent symmetry‐breaking scenarios where skyrmion lattices can break translational or rotational symmetry.\n2. It ignores discrete symmetries (e.g.\nparity, time reversal) that may be spontaneously broken in each system.\n3. It overlooks that phonons in crystals stem from discrete lattice translations approximated as continuous, so arguably no exact continuous symmetry is broken.\n4. It does not discuss explicit versus spontaneous breaking in real materials, nor the role of gauge or higher‐form symmetries.\n5. It assumes simple model symmetries (e.g. SU(2) for spins) without considering anisotropies or lower‐dimensional effects that can change the counting of Goldstone modes.; correct: B) Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent tmdc, refining comparison, thinking: Magnons, pions, and phonons are all Goldstone modes arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries (spin rotations, chiral SU(2)L×SU(2)R, and continuous translations, respectively).
