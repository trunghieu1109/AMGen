Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: All agents agree that Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, unlike magnons, pions, and phonons. Skyrmions are topological solitons and do not arise from spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. The choice corresponding to Skyrmion is B). Therefore, the correct answer is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
