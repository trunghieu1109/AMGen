Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_173
proposed answer: The difference between the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1_rel - T1_classical) has been computed to be approximately 10 MeV. This result is consistent across multiple detailed analyses and sub-task solutions. The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, and the mass defect after fission corresponds to 3 GeV of kinetic energy released. The fragments have rest masses in a 2:1 ratio, and conservation of momentum and relativistic energy-momentum relations confirm that the classical kinetic energy underestimates the true kinetic energy by about 10 MeV. Among the given choices (10 MeV, 5 MeV, 2 MeV, 20 MeV), 10 MeV (choice A) matches the computed difference best and is the correct answer.

proposed answer: The computed difference Î”T between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is approximately 10 MeV, as consistently found in the previous sub-tasks and confirmed by multiple agents. This difference is significant and exceeds the 1 MeV threshold for discrepancy, but since the calculations are consistent and verified, no re-computation is necessary. Among the provided options (10 MeV, 5 MeV, 2 MeV, 20 MeV), the value 10 MeV matches the computed difference exactly. Therefore, the correct answer choice is A).
