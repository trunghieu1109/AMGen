Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_173
proposed answer: The sub-task 5 conclusion was that the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations is 10 MeV. The original question provides four choices for this difference: A) 10 MeV, B) 5 MeV, C) 2 MeV, and D) 20 MeV. Since the computed difference is 10 MeV, the correct choice is A).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_173
proposed answer: The final decision in sub-task 6 determined that the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 10 MeV. This conclusion was based on the analysis of the energy released due to the mass defect and the typical effects of relativistic corrections at high energies. The choice corresponding to a 10 MeV difference is A).
