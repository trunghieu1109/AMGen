In electrostatic equilibrium, the conductor’s interior electric field must be zero, so induced charges appear on the cavity wall and outer surface. The conductor is an equipotential, imposing boundary conditions on the potential at the cavity wall and outer surface. Gauss’s law then tells us that the total induced charge on the inner wall is –q (to cancel the cavity field within the conductor), and +q appears on the outer surface, so that the sphere remains overall neutral. Finally, by the uniqueness theorem and spherical symmetry of the outer surface charge distribution, the field outside is that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.; answer: Relevant principles and boundary conditions:\n1. Electrostatic equilibrium: E=0 everywhere inside the conducting material.\n2. Conductor is an equipotential: potential constant on inner cavity wall and outer surface.\n3. Induced charge distribution: –q on cavity wall, +q on outer surface (total conductor charge remains zero).\n4. Gauss’s law: net enclosed charge determines field; outside only +q on outer surface.\n5. Uniqueness theorem and spherical symmetry: external field equals that of point charge +q placed at the conductor’s center.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent OgEG, identifying physics principles, thinking: The key principles are: 1) Electrostatic shielding: the conductor must be an equipotential, so any internal off‐center charge induces a surface charge distribution that exactly cancels the field inside the conducting material. 2) Gauss’s law for conductors: since the conductor was initially uncharged, the total induced charge on its outer surface equals +q, ensuring the net enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the sphere is q. 3) Boundary conditions: the potential on the metal surface is constant and the field inside the conducting material is zero. These ensure that externally the field is exactly that of a point charge q at the center of the spherical conductor.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent kZAB, deriving E formula, thinking: The uncharged conductor with an off-center cavity and internal charge +q induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface.
