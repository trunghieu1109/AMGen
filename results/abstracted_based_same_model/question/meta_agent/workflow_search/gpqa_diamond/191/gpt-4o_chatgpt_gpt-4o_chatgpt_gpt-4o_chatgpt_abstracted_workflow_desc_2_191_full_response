The key principle here is that the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, leading to induced charges on the surfaces. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces a charge -q on the cavity\'s inner surface and a charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor. This results in the electric field outside the conductor being the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at any point outside the conductor (point P) is determined by the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. The correct formula for the electric field due to a point charge is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$, where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P.

The key physical principles involved are Gauss's Law and the superposition principle.

The charge +q induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity, and an equal charge on the outer surface of the conductor. However, the net charge on the conductor remains zero. According to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface surrounding the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the electric field outside is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor is determined by the charge +q and its distance from the point, following the inverse square law.
