Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity inside it, containing a charge +q. The conductor is uncharged overall. Due to electrostatic shielding, the external electric field behaves as if the entire charge +q were concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. This means the external field depends only on the total charge +q and the distance L from the center of the conductor. The displacement s of the cavity and the angle θ do not affect the external field. Among the given options, only choice D correctly expresses the electric field magnitude as E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), which aligns with the physical principles of electrostatics and conductor shielding. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
