Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. The conductor will redistribute its charges such that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. This results in an induced charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a corresponding +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Due to the symmetry and the properties of conductors, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. This is because the conductor's charge distribution ensures that the field outside is equivalent to that of a point charge at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is given by the expression for the field due to a point charge, which is $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$, where L is the distance from the center of the spherical conductor to the point P. This matches choice D.
