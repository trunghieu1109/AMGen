A monochromatic light of wavelength lambda is incident along the z-axis. This setup is a classic diffraction problem where the shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern observed in the far field. The polygon aperture with equal apothems means the aperture is inscribed in a circle of radius a. When N tends to infinity, the polygon approaches a circular aperture of radius a. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is well-known and is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the minima in the Airy pattern are given by the zeros of the Bessel function, with the first minimum at approximately 1.22 lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the apothem a corresponds to the radius, the diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture is approximately 1.22 lambda / (2a) = 0.61 lambda / a. This matches choice 2.

Since all apothems are length a, the polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius a. Therefore, the aperture effectively becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is well-known, and the angular position of the first minimum in the Airy pattern is approximately given by 1.22 lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture.

The intensity minima occur at angular positions where the argument of the Bessel function corresponds to its zeros. Specifically, the first minimum occurs at an angle theta_1 such that (2 * pi * a / lambda) * sin(theta_1) = 3.8317, where 3.8317 is the first zero of J1. For small angles, sin(theta) ~ theta, so theta_1 = 3.8317 * lambda / (2 * pi * a) ≈ 0.61 * lambda / a. The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of J1, approximately 7.0156, so theta_2 = 7.0156 * lambda / (2 * pi * a). The angular distance between the first two minima is then theta_2 - theta_1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * lambda / (2 * pi * a) ≈ 0.506 * lambda / a. This matches choice D).

The angular position of the first minimum in the Airy pattern is approximately 1.22 lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since D = 2a, the angular position of the first minimum is 1.22 lambda / (2a) = 0.61 lambda / a.

The intensity minima occur at angular positions where the argument of the Bessel function corresponds to its zeros. Specifically, the first minimum occurs at an angle theta_1 such that (2 * pi * a / lambda) * sin(theta_1) = 3.8317, where 3.8317 is the first zero of J1. For small angles, sin(theta) ~ theta, so theta_1 = 3.8317 * lambda / (2 * pi * a) ≈ 0.61 * lambda / a. The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of J1, approximately 7.0156, so theta_2 = 7.0156 * lambda / (2 * pi * a). The angular distance between the first two minima is then theta_2 - theta_1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * lambda / (2 * pi * a) ≈ 0.506 * lambda / a. This matches choice D).

However, the limitation of this check is that it only confirms a difference in numerical values and does not validate the underlying assumptions or the derivation steps leading to these values. It also assumes the small angle approximation and the infinite N limit without re-examining their impact on the results. Therefore, while the check confirms internal consistency, it does not guarantee the absolute correctness of the physical model or the approximations used.; answer: The self-consistency check is valid for confirming that Δθ ≠ θ₁, ensuring no confusion between the first minimum position and the angular distance between minima.
