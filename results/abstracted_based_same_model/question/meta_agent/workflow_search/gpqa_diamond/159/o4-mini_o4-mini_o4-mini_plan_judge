Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: For a circular aperture (N→∞) of diameter D=2a, the first diffraction minimum occurs at θ1≈1.22λ/D=1.22λ/(2a)=0.610λ/a. The first two minima are symmetrically located at ±θ1, so the angular separation between them is 2θ1≈2×0.610λ/a=1.220λ/a, which matches choice A).

proposed answer: From the computed value Δθ ≈ 0.5074 λ/a and the provided options—1.220, 0.610, 0.500, 0.506 λ/a—the closest match is 0.506 λ/a, which corresponds to option D.
