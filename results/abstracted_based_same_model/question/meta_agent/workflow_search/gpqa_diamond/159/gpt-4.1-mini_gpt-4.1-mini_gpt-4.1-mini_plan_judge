proposed answer: When the polygon has an infinite number of sides, it effectively becomes a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem length a. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is well-known: the first minimum occurs at an angular position approximately given by 1.22 * lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the diameter D = 2a, the first minimum angle is approximately 1.22 * lambda / (2a) = 0.61 * lambda / a. The angular distance between the first two minima is roughly the same order. The small angle approximation (tan theta ≈ theta) does not change this result. Comparing this with the given options, 0.610 * lambda / a matches the known value for the first minimum angular position of a circular aperture. Therefore, the correct choice is B).

proposed answer: All four debate agents independently concluded that the calculated angular distance between the first two minima, Δθ, is approximately 0.506 λ / a. This value exactly matches option D) 0.506 λ / a. The other options (A, B, and C) differ significantly from this calculated value. The consistency among all agents and the exact match with option D) strongly supports that the correct choice is D).
