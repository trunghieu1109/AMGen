The energy function is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). By calculating energies, we find two configurations have energy -3J and six configurations have energy J. The Boltzmann factors for these energies are e^{3Jβ} for energy -3J and e^{-Jβ} for energy J, respectively. Summing over all configurations, the partition function Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. This matches choice A exactly, which is Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ). Therefore, the simplified partition function expression is choice A.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1XU3:\nFrom the previous sub-task, the partition function Z was found to be Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ). This expression groups the Boltzmann factors by energy levels: two configurations have energy -3J (giving e^(3Jβ)) and six configurations have energy J (giving e^(-Jβ)).

There are 2 configurations with energy -3J, contributing 2 * e^{3Jβ}, and 6 configurations with energy J, contributing 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Thus, Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}. This matches choice A exactly, as the other choices have incorrect exponents or coefficients. Therefore, the simplified and correct expression for the partition function is choice A.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5MEU:\nThe partition function Z is the sum of Boltzmann factors for all possible spin configurations. There are 8 configurations total (2^3). From previous analysis, two configurations have energy -3J, contributing 2 * e^(3Jβ), and six configurations have energy J, contributing 6 * e^(-Jβ). Grouping terms by energy values, Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ). Among the given options, only choice A matches this expression exactly.
