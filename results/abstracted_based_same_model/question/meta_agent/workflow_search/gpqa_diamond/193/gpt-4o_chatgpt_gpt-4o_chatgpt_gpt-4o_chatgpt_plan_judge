Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The partition function Z is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors for all possible configurations of the system. From the sub-tasks, we determined that there are 2 configurations with energy -3J, each contributing a Boltzmann factor of e^(3Jβ), and 6 configurations with energy J, each contributing a Boltzmann factor of e^(-Jβ). Therefore, the partition function Z is given by Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ). Comparing this with the given choices, we find that choice A) matches our calculated partition function. Thus, the correct answer is A).
