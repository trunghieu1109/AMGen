proposed answer: The partition function Z is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors e^{-βE} over all possible spin configurations. For three spins each taking values ±1, there are 2^3 = 8 configurations. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). By enumerating all configurations, we find that two configurations have energy -3J and six configurations have energy J. The corresponding Boltzmann factors are e^{3Jβ} for energy -3J and e^{-Jβ} for energy J. Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Among the given options, only choice A matches this expression exactly. Hence, the correct partition function expression is choice A.
