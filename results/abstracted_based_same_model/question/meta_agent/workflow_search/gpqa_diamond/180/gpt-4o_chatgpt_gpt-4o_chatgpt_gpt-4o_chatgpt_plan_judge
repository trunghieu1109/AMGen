proposed answer: The pp-III branch in the Sun's core is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly those from Boron-8 decay, which significantly contribute to the higher energy portion of the solar neutrino spectrum. When the pp-III branch ceases, it most significantly affects the higher energy neutrino bands, such as the 800-900 keV band. The 700-800 keV band is less affected because it is more likely populated by neutrinos from other reactions like pp-I and pp-II branches, which continue to operate. Therefore, the flux in the 800-900 keV band decreases more significantly than in the 700-800 keV band, leading to an increased ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2). This analysis supports the conclusion that the ratio is 10.

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar fusion reactions is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly those from the decay of B-8, which contribute significantly to the 800-900 keV energy band. If the pp-III branch were to suddenly stop, the flux of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV band would decrease significantly because it would lose the contribution from B-8 neutrinos. On the other hand, the 700-800 keV band is primarily influenced by neutrinos from the pp-I chain, such as pp and pep neutrinos, which are not affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. Therefore, the flux in the 700-800 keV band remains relatively constant. As a result, the ratio of the flux in the 700-800 keV band to the flux in the 800-900 keV band would increase. All the debate agents agree that this results in a higher ratio, specifically around 10, because the 800-900 keV band loses a significant portion of its neutrino flux while the 700-800 keV band remains mostly unchanged. Thus, the most plausible answer is B) 10.
