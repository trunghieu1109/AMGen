The spectrum is continuous from zero up to 0.420\u2009MeV (end‐point), with a mean energy ≈0.265\u2009MeV. The flux at Earth is about 6.0×10¹⁰\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹, which is ≈91% of the total solar ν_e flux.\n\n2. pp-II branch (⁷Be electron capture → ⁷Li + ν_e): yields monoenergetic lines at 0.384\u2009MeV (≈10.3% of ⁷Be captures) and 0.862\u2009MeV (≈89.7%).

Its flux is ≈5×10⁶\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹, only ≈0.01% of the total.; answer - pp-I: continuous 0–0.420\u2009MeV, flux ≈6.0×10¹⁰\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹ (~91%);\npp-II: monoenergetic at 0.384\u2009MeV (10.3%) and 0.862\u2009MeV (89.7%), total ≈4.9×10⁹\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹ (~7%);\npp-III: continuous 0–15\u2009MeV (⌀~7\u2009MeV), flux ≈5×10⁶\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹ (~0.01%).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Neutrinos in the 700–900 keV window come only from the 0.862 MeV line of 7Be (pp-II) and the low‐energy tail of the 8B β⁺‐decay spectrum (pp-III). The pp-I spectrum ends at 420 keV, and pp-II has no other lines in this band. The pp-III branch’s total flux is ∼5×10^6 cm⁻² s⁻¹, but its spectrum near 0.8 MeV is heavily suppressed (dN/dE∝E² at low E compared to E_max≈14 MeV). Integrating from 0.7 to 0.9 MeV gives only ≈10^2–10^3 cm⁻² s⁻¹, versus ≈4.4×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹ from the 7Be line. Thus pp-III contributes ≪1% (of order 10^−4–10^−3) of the total 700–900 keV neutrino flux.; answer - Only the pp-II 7Be line and the pp-III 8B continuum; pp-III contributes ≪1% (≈10⁻⁴–10⁻³) of the flux in 700–900 keV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Neutrinos produced in the Sun’s core take about 8.5 minutes to reach Earth. If pp-III (the 8B decay channel) stopped 8.5 minutes ago, all arriving neutrinos from pp-III would vanish now. Band 1 (700–800 keV) neutrinos come almost entirely from the pp-III 8B continuum, so its flux drops to zero. Band 2 (800–900 keV) receives a large, unaffected contribution from the 7Be line at 861 keV (pp-II branch).

The 8 B total flux is ~5×10^6 cm⁻² s⁻¹, but only a tiny fraction falls between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV (∼10^5–10^6 cm⁻² s⁻¹), i.e. ≪1% of the 7 Be line in that window.; answer: Neutrinos in 700–900 keV come only from the 0.862 MeV 7Be line (pp-II) and from the continuous pp-III (8B) spectrum, with pp-III contributing ≪1% of the 700–900 keV flux.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 3ZTP, feedback: The branch selection is sound: only the mono‐energetic 7Be line (pp‐II) at 0.862 MeV and the continuous 8B spectrum (pp‐III) populate the 700–900 keV window. However, the pp‐III share estimate (≪1%) is very approximate. It stems from a simple integration of the 8B spectrum and neglects detector energy resolution, spectral‐shape uncertainties, small CNO contributions, and flux‐model variances. These factors can shift the quoted fraction by factors of a few.; correct: Only pp-II (7Be) and pp-III (8B) feed the 700–900 keV range, with pp-III contributing ≪1% of that flux, albeit with sizable model and instrumental uncertainties.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent QrLn, refining branch selection, thinking: Neutrinos in the 700–900 keV window come only from the 0.862 MeV line of 7Be (pp-II) and the low‐energy tail of the 8B β⁺‐decay spectrum (pp-III).

Removing pp-III removes all 8B neutrinos: band 1 flux →0 (since no other source produces neutrinos there), band 2 flux remains from the 862 keV 7Be line at ≈4.9×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹.

The former band’s flux drops essentially to zero, giving a ratio ≲10⁻².; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent APsk, round 0, modeling removal, thinking: To model the removal of the pp-III branch (the 8B decay component) from the solar neutrino spectrum at Earth, we note: \n1. In the Standard Solar Model the 8B neutrinos constitute a high-energy continuum up to ∼15\u2009MeV, with total flux ∼5×10^6\u2009cm^−2\u2009s^−1 (∼0.01% of the total). \n2. If the pp-III branch is switched off in the core 8.5\u2009min ago, all 8B neutrinos arriving now would be gone.  \n3.

Thus above ∼1\u2009MeV the only residual lines are the pep (1.44\u2009MeV) and CNO neutrinos; the high-energy continuous tail vanishes.  \n5. Numerically, the total 8B contribution is simply subtracted from the overall flux and the spectral shape above ∼1\u2009MeV collapses to the non-8B lines.  \n\nAnswer description: subtract the 8B spectrum entirely, leaving only pp, pep, 7Be and CNO contributions.; answer: The solar‐neutrino spectrum at Earth with pp-III removed consists solely of the pp continuum (0–0.42\u2009MeV), the 7Be lines (0.384 and 0.862\u2009MeV), plus the pep (1.44\u2009MeV) and CNO components; the high‐energy 8B continuum above ∼1\u2009MeV is completely gone.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent rhPu, round 0, modeling removal, thinking: To model the removal of the pp-III (8B decay) contribution, we simply subtract its entire flux and spectral shape from the standard solar neutrino spectrum arriving at Earth.

The resulting Earth‐observed spectrum therefore has no neutrinos above the 7Be endpoint, and its total flux is reduced by the original 8B contribution (~0.01% of the total).; answer: The modified Earth‐arrival spectrum comprises the unchanged pp-I continuum (0–0.420 MeV) plus the unchanged 7Be lines at 0.384 and 0.862 MeV, with the entire 8B continuum flux removed (zero neutrinos above ~1 MeV).\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, thinking: We adopt the standard solar‐neutrino spectrum at Earth and simply subtract the entire pp-III (8B) component.
