Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that each of the issues listed can lead to difficult-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis. The issues include mutually incompatible data formats, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. While some agents argue that '2, 3, and 4' are particularly difficult to spot, the majority consensus is that all of these issues are common sources of errors. Therefore, the most comprehensive choice is 'All of the above', as it encompasses all potential issues listed.
