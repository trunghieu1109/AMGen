Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1. This is determined by considering the mass dimensions of the components in the Lagrangian. The Dirac field \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of 3/2, and the field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of 2. The term \( \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi \) has a mass dimension of 3, making the total dimension of \( \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \) equal to 5. To ensure the Lagrangian has a mass dimension of 4, \( \kappa \) must have a mass dimension of -1. A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension. Since \( \kappa \) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice is C).
