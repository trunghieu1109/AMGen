proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε \vec{σ}.\vec{n}, where \vec{σ} are the Pauli matrices and \vec{n} is a unit vector. The dot product \vec{σ}.\vec{n} results in a 2x2 matrix that is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. This matrix has eigenvalues of +1 and -1 because it is a Hermitian matrix formed by a unit vector and Pauli matrices. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H are ε times the eigenvalues of \vec{σ}.\vec{n}, which are +ε and -ε.
