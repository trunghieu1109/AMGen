### thinking by Debate Agent OfZu:
The Hamiltonian given is H = ε \vec{σ}.\vec{n}. The term \vec{σ}.\vec{n} represents the dot product of the Pauli matrices with a unit vector, which results in a 2x2 matrix that can be expressed as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of \vec{σ}.\vec{n} are ±1 because it is a unitary matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ε (\vec{σ}.\vec{n}) are obtained by multiplying the eigenvalues of \vec{σ}.\vec{n} by ε, resulting in ±ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:
The Hamiltonian given is $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ are Pauli matrices and $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector. The dot product $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, which can be represented as a matrix with eigenvalues of +1 and -1. Since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ are $\varepsilon \times (+1)$ and $\varepsilon \times (-1)$, which are $+\varepsilon$ and $-\varepsilon$.

### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:
The Hamiltonian given is H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}, where \vec{\sigma} are the Pauli matrices and \vec{n} is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices are known to have eigenvalues of +1 and -1. Since \vec{n} is a unit vector, \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n} is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, which also results in a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues of +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H will be \varepsilon times the eigenvalues of \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}, which are +\varepsilon and -\varepsilon.

### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:
The Hamiltonian operator given is $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices and $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector. The dot product $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, which is itself a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues of +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$ are simply $\varepsilon$ times the eigenvalues of $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, which results in $+\varepsilon$ and $-\varepsilon$.

The dot product \vec{σ}.\vec{n} results in a 2x2 matrix that is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. This matrix has eigenvalues of +1 and -1 because it is a Hermitian matrix formed by a unit vector and Pauli matrices.
