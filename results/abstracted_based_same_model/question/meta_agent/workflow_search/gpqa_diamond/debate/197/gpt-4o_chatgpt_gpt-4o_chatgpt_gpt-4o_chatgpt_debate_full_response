Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent xiWy', content='The problem involves calculating the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The stability constants (β values) are used to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is calculated using β2 and the initial concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of the concentrations of all complexes. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. The calculations show that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is approximately 29.32%, which is closest to the choice 25.6%.

The given stability constants (β) are used to determine the concentration of each complex. The overall concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all its complexes. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the stability constant β2 and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. Once we have the concentration of Co(SCN)2, we can find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration. Let's calculate:\n\n1. Calculate the total concentration of cobalt complexes:\n   - [Co] = c(Co) = 10^-2 M\n   - [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n   - β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16\n\n2. Calculate the concentration of each complex:\n   - [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co] * [SCN-] = 9 * 10^-2 * 0.1\n   - [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^2\n   - [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co] * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^3\n   - [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co] * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^4\n\n3. Calculate the total concentration of cobalt species:\n   - Total [Co] = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]:\n   - % Co(SCN)2 = ([Co(SCN)2] / Total [Co]) * 100\n\nPerforming these calculations gives us the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:\nTo find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt complexes. The formation constants (β values) given are for the stepwise formation of complexes: Co + SCN- -> Co(SCN) (β1), Co(SCN) + SCN- -> Co(SCN)2 (β2), etc. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is 10^-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The equilibrium concentrations can be calculated using these β values and the initial concentrations. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as [Co(SCN)2] / total concentration of cobalt species. The β2 value directly gives us the equilibrium concentration of Co(SCN)2 relative to the free Co and SCN- ions. Using β2 = 40, [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co][SCN-]^2. Calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and then find its percentage among all cobalt species.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:\nTo find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the distribution of cobalt in various thiocyanato complexes.
