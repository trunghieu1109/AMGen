Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The stability constants (β values) are used to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is calculated using β2 and the initial concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of the concentrations of all complexes. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. The calculations show that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is approximately 29.32%, which is closest to the choice 25.6%. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is C) 25.6%.
