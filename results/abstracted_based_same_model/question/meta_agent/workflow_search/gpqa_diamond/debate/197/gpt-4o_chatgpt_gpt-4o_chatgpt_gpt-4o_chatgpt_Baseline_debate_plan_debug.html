### thinking by Debate Agent E6Fv:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the distribution of cobalt among its different complexes. The given stability constants (β) are used to determine the concentration of each complex. The overall concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all its complexes. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the stability constant β2 and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. Once we have the concentration of Co(SCN)2, we can find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration. Let&#39;s calculate:

1. Calculate the total concentration of cobalt complexes:
   - [Co] = c(Co) = 10^-2 M
   - [SCN-] = 0.1 M
   - β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16

2. Calculate the concentration of each complex:
   - [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co] * [SCN-] = 9 * 10^-2 * 0.1
   - [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^2
   - [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co] * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^3
   - [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co] * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^4

3. Calculate the total concentration of cobalt species:
   - Total [Co] = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]

4. Calculate the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]:
   - % Co(SCN)2 = ([Co(SCN)2] / Total [Co]) * 100

Performing these calculations gives us the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.

### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt complexes. The formation constants (β values) given are for the stepwise formation of complexes: Co + SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN) (β1), Co(SCN) + SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)2 (β2), etc. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is 10^-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The equilibrium concentrations can be calculated using these β values and the initial concentrations. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as [Co(SCN)2] / total concentration of cobalt species. The β2 value directly gives us the equilibrium concentration of Co(SCN)2 relative to the free Co and SCN- ions. Using β2 = 40, [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co][SCN-]^2. Calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and then find its percentage among all cobalt species.

### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the distribution of cobalt in various thiocyanato complexes. The stability constants (β) for the complexes can be used to calculate the concentrations of each cobalt species. The given stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. 

The concentration of each complex can be calculated using the stability constants and the initial concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The total concentration of Co(II) is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co]total = [Co]free + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-. 

Using the stability constants, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] can be calculated as: 

[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co]free * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * [Co]free * (0.1)^2.

For simplicity, we can assume that most of the Co(II) is in the form of these complexes due to the high concentration of SCN-. 

The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is then calculated as: 

%[Co(SCN)2] = ([Co(SCN)2] / [Co]total) * 100%.

Substituting the values, we calculate the percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt-containing species.

To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to determine the concentration of Co(SCN)2 relative to the total cobalt concentration. The stability constants (β) represent the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes: 

- β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN]) = 9
- β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co][SCN]^2) = 40
- β3 = [Co(SCN)3] / ([Co][SCN]^3) = 63
- β4 = [Co(SCN)4] / ([Co][SCN]^4) = 16

Given [Co] = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we can calculate the concentrations of each cobalt species using these constants:

1. [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co][SCN] = 9 * 10^-2 * 0.1
2. [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co][SCN]^2 = 40 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^2
3. [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co][SCN]^3 = 63 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^3
4. [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co][SCN]^4 = 16 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^4

Next, calculate these concentrations:

1. [Co(SCN)] = 0.09 M
2. [Co(SCN)2] = 0.04 M
3. [Co(SCN)3] = 0.0063 M
4. [Co(SCN)4] = 0.00016 M

The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of these concentrations:

Total [Co] = [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = 0.09 + 0.04 + 0.0063 + 0.00016 = 0.13646 M

The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is:

Percentage = ([Co(SCN)2] / Total [Co]) * 100 = (0.04 / 0.13646) * 100 ≈ 29.32%

However, none of the given choices match this calculation exactly. The closest choice is 25.6%.
