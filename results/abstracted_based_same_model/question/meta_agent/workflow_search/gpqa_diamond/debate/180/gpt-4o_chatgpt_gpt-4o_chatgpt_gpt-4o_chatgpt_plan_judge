Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain reaction produces high-energy neutrinos, particularly from the decay of Beryllium-7 and Boron-8, which contribute to the higher energy neutrino spectrum (above 800 keV). If the pp-III branch stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (800-900 keV) would be significantly reduced, while the lower energy neutrinos (700-800 keV) would remain relatively unchanged as they are primarily produced by other branches like pp-I and pp-II. Therefore, the flux of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range (band 1) would be much higher relative to the flux in the 800-900 keV range (band 2), as the latter is more affected by the cessation of the pp-III branch. This suggests a higher ratio of band 1 to band 2 flux, leading to a ratio of 10.
