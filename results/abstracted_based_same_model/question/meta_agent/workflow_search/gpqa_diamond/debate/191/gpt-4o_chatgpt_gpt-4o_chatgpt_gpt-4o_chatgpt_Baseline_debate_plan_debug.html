    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. Due to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. Thus, the charge +q induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity, while the outer surface of the conductor remains uncharged. For a point outside the conductor, the entire system behaves as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Hence, the electric field at point P depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor and not the position of the charge inside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb&#39;s law for a point charge at the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor will rearrange its charges such that the electric field inside the conductor (outside the cavity) is zero. This means that the charge on the inner surface of the cavity will be -q, and the outer surface of the conductor will have a charge of +q to maintain neutrality. For points outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor due to the spherical symmetry of the problem. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is determined by the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, which is L.

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
The problem involves a charged conductor with a cavity and a point charge inside the cavity. By Gauss&#39;s law, the electric field outside a conductor with a cavity containing a charge is determined by the net charge enclosed. The spherical conductor is uncharged, so it will have an induced charge on its inner surface equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity, and an equal charge on the outer surface. However, the field outside the conductor is only due to the net charge inside the cavity, which is +q. The electric field at a point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, should be treated as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Hence, the electric field at P is given by Coulomb&#39;s law for a point charge at a distance L.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
When a charge +q is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. The conductor itself remains neutral, so it will have an equal positive charge distributed on its outer surface. For a point outside the conductor, the field is due to the charge on the outer surface. By Gauss&#39;s law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor with a net charge is as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center. Thus, the electric field at point P depends on the distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, not the cavity.
