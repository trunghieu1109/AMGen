Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operators P and Q. The operator P has eigenvalues sqrt(2), 0, and -sqrt(2), with the eigenvector for 0 being [0, 1, 0]. The probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the projection of the initial state [-1, 2, 1] onto [0, 1, 0], which is 4/6 = 2/3. After measuring 0 for P, the state collapses to [0, 1, 0]. The operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1, with the eigenvector for -1 being [0, 0, 1]. The probability of measuring -1 for Q given the state [0, 1, 0] is 0, as the projection is zero. Therefore, the overall probability is (2/3) * 0 = 0. The correct answer is B) 1/6, as the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is 0.
