### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of spins in a lattice, typically arising from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in magnetic materials. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can arise in certain field theories, often related to broken symmetries in condensed matter systems. A pion is a meson that can be considered as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, but it is not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same sense as the others. Therefore, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

To determine which of the particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice and is related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton solution that can occur in certain field theories and is not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. A pion is a meson that arises as a pseudo-Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice and is associated with the breaking of translational symmetry. Therefore, the skyrmion is the particle among the list that is not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
To solve this question, we need to identify which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a crystal lattice, often related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton which can occur in fields like nuclear physics and condensed matter, often related to certain symmetry breakings. A pion is a meson that emerges from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quasiparticle representing quantized sound waves or lattice vibrations in a crystal, which is not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. Therefore, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option: A) A magnon is an effective particle associated with the collective excitation in a system that exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking in magnetism (spin waves). B) A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can arise in certain field theories and is not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. C) A pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. D) A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice and is associated with the breaking of translational symmetry. Therefore, the skyrmion is the particle not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

    <pre>The question asks which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. A magnon is associated with the breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetic systems. A pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. A phonon is associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in crystals. A skyrmion, however, is a topological soliton and is not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. Therefore, the skyrmion is the correct choice.
