Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is due to the relativistic effects not accounted for in the classical approximation. The total kinetic energy released is 3 GeV, and the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV. The classical approximation underestimates the kinetic energy due to ignoring relativistic momentum. After considering the detailed calculations and consensus among the agents, the difference is found to be 10 MeV.
