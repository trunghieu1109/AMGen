Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the uncertainty ΔPz, we need to calculate the expectation value of Pz and Pz². The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrix for Pz is diagonal with elements (ℏ, 0, -ℏ). First, calculate ⟨Pz⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩. The state vector in bra form is the conjugate transpose: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)*. Calculate ⟨Pz⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)* * (ℏ, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, -ℏ) * (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). This simplifies to (ℏ/4 - ℏ/4) = 0. Next, calculate ⟨Pz²⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz²|ψ⟩. Pz² is (ℏ², 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, ℏ²). Calculate ⟨Pz²⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)* * (ℏ², 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, ℏ²) * (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). This simplifies to (ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = ℏ²/2. The uncertainty ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt(ℏ²/2 - 0²) = ℏ/√2. Therefore, the correct answer is C).
