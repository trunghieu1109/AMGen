    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
To solve this, we need to consider the factors affecting the luminosity of stars. Luminosity (L) is related to the radius (R) and temperature (T) of a star by the formula L = 4πR^2σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that the stars have the same peak wavelength, which implies they have the same temperature (Wien&#39;s Law). Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is determined by the square of the radius ratio. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
To determine the luminosity ratio, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since the wavelengths of maximum emission are the same for both stars, their temperatures are equal due to Wien&#39;s Displacement Law. Given Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = 1.5² = 2.25. The radial velocities and mass do not affect luminosity in this context.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
The luminosity of a star is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars radiate as black bodies and have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien&#39;s Displacement Law). Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 can be calculated by the ratio of their radii squared: (1.5)² = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we can use the black body radiation and Stefan-Boltzmann law. Since the wavelength at which both stars appear brightest is the same, they have the same temperature. The luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocity does not affect luminosity calculations.
