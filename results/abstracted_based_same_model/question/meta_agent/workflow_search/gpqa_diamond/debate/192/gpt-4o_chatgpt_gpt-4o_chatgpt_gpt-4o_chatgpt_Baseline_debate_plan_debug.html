    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, resulting in the number of stars varying as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance, r, changes as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Therefore, plx^5 ~ (1/r)^5. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which implies it varies as r^5. Thus, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as r^5 per unit range of distance.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r to get the relation in terms of distance: 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies as r^5 with distance.

### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:
The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, leading to the expression (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with the fifth power of the distance, r.

### answer by Debate Agent 79YQ:
D) ~ r^5

### answer by Debate Agent jaKR:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent 6GRO:
D) ~ r^5

### answer by Debate Agent mN8g:
D) ~ r^5

    <pre>The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), meaning plx ~ 1/r. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Substituting plx with 1/r, we get 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with the fifth power of the distance, r. All agents agree on this reasoning, and the correct choice is D) ~ r^5.
