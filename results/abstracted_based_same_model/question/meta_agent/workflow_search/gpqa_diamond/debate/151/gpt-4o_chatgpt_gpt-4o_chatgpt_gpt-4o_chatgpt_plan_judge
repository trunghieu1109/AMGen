Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks which protein complex is least likely to be observed in an assay of active chromatin during shmoo formation in yeast. Shmoo formation is related to mating and involves transcriptional changes. The pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are all involved in transcription and chromatin structure, making them likely to be present in active chromatin. The pre-replication complex, however, is involved in DNA replication initiation, which is not directly related to transcriptional activity or shmoo formation. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex are least likely to be observed in this context.
