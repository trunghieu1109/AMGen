Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator can be found by considering the conversion of potential energy at maximum amplitude into kinetic energy. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA^2. In the relativistic case, the total energy is given by E = γmc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). At maximum speed, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, and the expression for v_max involves solving for v in terms of the Lorentz factor. The correct expression for v_max is found to be v_max = c√(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which corresponds to choice B.
