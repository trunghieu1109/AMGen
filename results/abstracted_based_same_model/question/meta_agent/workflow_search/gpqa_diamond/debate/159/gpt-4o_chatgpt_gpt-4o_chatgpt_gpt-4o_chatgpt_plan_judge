Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves diffraction through an aperture that becomes circular as the number of sides N approaches infinity. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first diffraction minimum is given by the formula \( \theta = 1.22 \lambda / D \), where \( D \) is the diameter of the aperture. In this case, the apothem \( a \) is equivalent to the radius of the circle, so the diameter \( D = 2a \). Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is \( 1.22 \lambda / a \). All agents agree on this reasoning, leading to the choice A).
