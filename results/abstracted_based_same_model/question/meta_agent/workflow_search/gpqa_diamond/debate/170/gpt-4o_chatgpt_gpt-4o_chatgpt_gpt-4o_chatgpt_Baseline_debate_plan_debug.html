### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
In electrophilic substitution reactions, the position of substitution on the benzene ring depends on the substituents already present. Activating groups (such as alkyl groups) tend to direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups (such as nitro and carboxyl groups) direct substitution to the meta position. The weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer will be higher for substituents that are strong ortho/para directors. Analyzing the given compounds:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) - methyl is an activating group, ortho/para director.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) - ester group is moderately deactivating, meta director.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) - chlorine is weakly deactivating but an ortho/para director.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) - nitro is strongly deactivating, meta director.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) - ethyl is an activating group, ortho/para director.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) - carboxyl is deactivating, meta director.

Considering the para-directing strength: 5 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 4.
Therefore, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is 4 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 3 &lt; 1 &lt; 5.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
To determine the order of substances based on the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. Ortho/para-directing groups, such as alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5), halogens (e.g., -Cl), and ester groups (e.g., -COOC2H5), generally increase the yield of the para-isomer. Meta-directing groups, such as -NO2 and -COOH, generally decrease the yield of the para-isomer. Considering these effects: 1) C6H5-CH3 and 5) C6H5-C2H5 are ortho/para-directing, favoring para substitution. 3) C6H5-Cl is also ortho/para-directing but less activating than alkyl groups. 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 is weakly ortho/para-directing. 4) C6H5-NO2 and 6) C6H5-COOH are meta-directing, thus they will have a lower yield of para-isomer. Considering this, the order of increasing para-isomer yield should be: 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3.

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups, such as alkyl groups, direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups, such as nitro groups, direct the electrophile to the meta position. The stronger the activating effect, the higher the para-isomer yield. 1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) is an activating group due to the electron-donating methyl group, favoring ortho/para substitution. 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating group, but less so than nitro. 3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) is weakly deactivating and ortho/para directing. 4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) is a strongly deactivating group, favoring meta substitution, thus least para. 5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) is similar to toluene, activating, favoring ortho/para. 6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) is deactivating, favoring meta, but less so than nitro. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield is: 4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5.

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
In electrophilic substitution reactions involving benzene rings, the substituents on the benzene ring determine the position of the incoming electrophile. Ortho/para directors are typically activating groups, such as alkyl groups, which increase the electron density of the benzene ring, while meta directors are generally deactivating groups, such as nitro groups, which decrease the electron density. 

For each substance:
1) C6H5-CH3: Toluene is an ortho/para director and activating, favoring para substitution.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The ester group is a meta director and deactivating, favoring meta substitution.
3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is an ortho/para director but slightly deactivating, favoring para substitution.
4) C6H5-NO2: The nitro group is a strong meta director and deactivating, favoring meta substitution.
5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethylbenzene is an ortho/para director and activating, favoring para substitution.
6) C6H5-COOH: The carboxylic acid group is a meta director and deactivating, favoring meta substitution.

Arranging the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:
- Nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest yield of para-isomer as it strongly favors meta substitution.
- The ester (2) and carboxylic acid (6) also favor meta substitution but to a lesser extent than nitro.
- Chlorobenzene (3) is an ortho/para director but less activating than alkyl groups, so it will have a higher para yield than the meta directors.
- Toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5) are strong ortho/para directors, with ethylbenzene likely having a slightly higher para yield due to less steric hindrance compared to toluene.

Thus, the order is 4 &lt; 6 &lt; 2 &lt; 1 &lt; 5 &lt; 3.

    <pre>The task is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. We need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups, such as alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5), direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups, such as nitro (-NO2) and carboxyl (-COOH), direct the electrophile to the meta position. Chlorine (-Cl) is weakly deactivating but still directs to ortho/para positions. The order of increasing para-isomer yield should be based on the strength of the para-directing effect: 4 (strongly meta-directing) &lt; 2 (meta-directing) &lt; 6 (meta-directing) &lt; 3 (ortho/para-directing but deactivating) &lt; 1 (ortho/para-directing and activating) &lt; 5 (ortho/para-directing and activating). This matches choice B) 4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5.
