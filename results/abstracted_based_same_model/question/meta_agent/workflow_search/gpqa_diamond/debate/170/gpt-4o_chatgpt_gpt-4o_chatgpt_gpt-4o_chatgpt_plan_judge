Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The task is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. We need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups, such as alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5), direct the electrophile to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups, such as nitro (-NO2) and carboxyl (-COOH), direct the electrophile to the meta position. Chlorine (-Cl) is weakly deactivating but still directs to ortho/para positions. The order of increasing para-isomer yield should be based on the strength of the para-directing effect: 4 (strongly meta-directing) < 2 (meta-directing) < 6 (meta-directing) < 3 (ortho/para-directing but deactivating) < 1 (ortho/para-directing and activating) < 5 (ortho/para-directing and activating). This matches choice B) 4<2<6<3<1<5.
