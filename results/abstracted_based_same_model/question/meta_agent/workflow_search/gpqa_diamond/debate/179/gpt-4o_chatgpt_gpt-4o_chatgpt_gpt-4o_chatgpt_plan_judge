Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charged particles. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from a fixed charge at point P. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r. Here, q1 = q2 = 2e, where e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), and r = 2 m. The potential energy for one pair is U_single = (8.9875 x 10^9) * (4 * (1.602 x 10^-19)^2) / 2. Calculating this gives U_single = 4.704 x 10^-27 J. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy is U_total = 12 * U_single = 5.645 x 10^-26 J. This matches the choice B).
