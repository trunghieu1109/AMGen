Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question is about the use of dual catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization to introduce regular branches. Statement 1 is about industrial implementation, which is true for LLDPE production. Statement 2 claims aluminum-based activators do not work, which is incorrect as they are commonly used. Statement 3 involves group VIa metals, which are not typically used for this purpose. Statement 4 suggests noble metals are too expensive, which is generally true but not relevant for common industrial processes. Therefore, statement 1 is the most accurate regarding industrial implementation.
