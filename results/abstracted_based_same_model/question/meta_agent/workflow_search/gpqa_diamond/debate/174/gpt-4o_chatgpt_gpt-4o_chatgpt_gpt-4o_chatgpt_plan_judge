Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape, radiating power as a function of the wavelength \lambda and angle \theta. The power distribution in such a system is often described by a dipole radiation pattern, which is proportional to sin^2(\theta). The maximum radiation occurs at \theta = 90^0. At \theta = 30^0, the power is proportional to sin^2(30^0) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at \theta = 30^0 is 1/4. The function of \lambda for radiated power is typically proportional to \lambda^(-4) for dipole radiation, which matches the Rayleigh scattering pattern. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that combines 1/4 with \lambda^(-4).
