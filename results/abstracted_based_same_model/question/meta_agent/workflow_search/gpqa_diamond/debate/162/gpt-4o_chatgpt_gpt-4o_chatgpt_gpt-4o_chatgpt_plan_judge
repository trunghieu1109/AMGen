Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 and the corresponding moles of H+ required. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to 0.000936 moles. Since the dissolution reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 0.002808 moles of H+. Using a 0.1 M acid, the volume required is 0.02808 L or 28.08 cm3. After dissolution, the total volume is 100 cm3, and the concentration of H+ is 0.02808 M, leading to a pH of approximately 1.55. However, the closest option provided is choice A, which suggests a pH of 2.04 and a volume of 28.05 cm3. This discrepancy might be due to rounding or assumptions in the problem, but choice A is the closest match.
