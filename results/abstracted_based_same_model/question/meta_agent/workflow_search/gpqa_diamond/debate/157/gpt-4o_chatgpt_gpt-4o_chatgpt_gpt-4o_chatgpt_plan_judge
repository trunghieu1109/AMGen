Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question involves a transcription factor with two mutations: a recessive loss-of-function mutation X in the transactivation domain and a dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation typically results in a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming nonfunctional complexes. Since mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, it likely affects the ability of the protein to dimerize properly. This could lead to protein aggregation, where the mutant protein binds to the wild-type protein but prevents it from functioning correctly, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. All agents agree that the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype.
