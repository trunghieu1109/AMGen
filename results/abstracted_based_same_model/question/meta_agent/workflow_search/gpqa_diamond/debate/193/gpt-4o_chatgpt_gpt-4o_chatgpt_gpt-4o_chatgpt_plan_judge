Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1.

proposed answer: To find the partition function Z, we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1. This gives us 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. For each configuration, we calculate the energy E using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We then compute the Boltzmann factor e^(-beta * E) for each configuration and sum these factors to find Z. The configurations (1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1) both have energy E = -3J, contributing e^(3Jbeta) each. The configurations (1,1,-1), (1,-1,1), (-1,1,1), (1,-1,-1), (-1,1,-1), and (-1,-1,1) each have energy E = J, contributing e^(-Jbeta) each. Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jbeta) + 6e^(-Jbeta).
