Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the spectrograph. Canopus and Polaris are bright stars with low apparent magnitudes, making them detectable. For the stars with absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, we calculate their apparent magnitudes using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). The star at 10 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15, the star at 200 pc has an apparent magnitude of 20.5, the star at 5 pc has an apparent magnitude of 13.5, and the star at 50 pc has an apparent magnitude of 18.5. The ESPRESSO spectrograph can detect stars with apparent magnitudes up to about 18. Therefore, Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc are detectable, resulting in 4 detectable stars.
