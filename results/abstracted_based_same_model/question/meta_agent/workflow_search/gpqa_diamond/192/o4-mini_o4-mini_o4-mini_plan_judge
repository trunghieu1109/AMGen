Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_15_192
proposed answer: We start with the observed relation N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, this implies N(plx) ∝ r^5. To convert to a distribution per unit distance, we use N(r) dr = N(plx) · |d(plx)/dr| dr. Differentiating, d(plx)/dr = –1/r^2, so |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2. Therefore N(r) ∝ r^5 · (1/r^2) = r^3. This matches the choice ~ r^3, which is option C.
