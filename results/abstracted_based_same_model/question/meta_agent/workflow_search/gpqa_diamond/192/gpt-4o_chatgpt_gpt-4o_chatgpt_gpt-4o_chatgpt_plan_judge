proposed answer: The original question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, given that it varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. We know that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), so plx = 1/r. Substituting this into the expression 1/plx^5 gives us 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. This matches choice D, which is '~ r^5'.

proposed answer: The original relationship states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), we have plx = 1/r. Therefore, the number of stars in terms of distance is N(r) ∝ r^5. However, when converting from parallax to distance, we must include the Jacobian factor |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2. This results in the number of stars per unit range of distance being N(r) ∝ r^5 * 1/r^2 = r^3. Thus, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^3. Comparing this with the given choices, the correct answer is C) ~ r^3.
