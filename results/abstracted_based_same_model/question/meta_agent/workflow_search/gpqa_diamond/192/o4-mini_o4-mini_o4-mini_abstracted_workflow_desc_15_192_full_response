Using plx=1/r gives N(plx)∝r^5. To convert per unit distance, use N(r)dr = N(plx)|d(plx)/dr| dr, and d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2 so |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2. Therefore N(r) ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3.

However, this result hinges on idealized assumptions: a perfectly complete and unbiased sample of stars, no parallax measurement errors, no interstellar extinction, and a truly uniform stellar density. In practice, selection effects (e.g. magnitude limits), Malmquist bias, and observational uncertainties will modify the observed dependence and can flatten or steepen the inferred N(r).; correct: ~ r^3\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent KqVe, refining derivation, thinking: Starting from N(plx)∝1/plx^5 and using plx=1/r gives N(plx)∝r^5.
