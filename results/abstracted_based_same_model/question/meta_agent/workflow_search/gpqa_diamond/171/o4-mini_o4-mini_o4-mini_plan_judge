Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Starting from the Boltzmann‐factor ratio we have (n_j/n_i)_1/(n_j/n_i)_2 = exp[ΔE/k*(1/T₂ − 1/T₁)] = 2. Taking the natural logarithm gives ln 2 = (ΔE/k)*(1/T₂ − 1/T₁). The reciprocal difference can be combined: 1/T₂ − 1/T₁ = (T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂). Substituting back yields ln 2 = (ΔE/k)*(T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂). Omitting the constant factor ΔE/k for the form of the relation matches choice D.
