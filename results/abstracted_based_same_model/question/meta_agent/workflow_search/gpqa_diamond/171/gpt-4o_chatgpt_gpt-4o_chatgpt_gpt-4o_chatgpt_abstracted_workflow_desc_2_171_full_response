The Boltzmann distribution relates the population of atoms in different energy states to the temperature of the system. Specifically, the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the energy difference between the states and the temperature. The formula is: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/kT), where N2 and N1 are the populations of the excited and lower energy states, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of these states, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

This means that the ratio of the excited state populations (N2/N1) in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two different energy states is given by: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/kT). For simplicity, let's assume the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both stars, so they cancel out. Therefore, we have: (N2/N1)_star1 = exp(-ΔE/kT1) and (N2/N1)_star2 = exp(-ΔE/kT2). Given that (N2/N1)_star1 = 2 * (N2/N1)_star2, we can write: exp(-ΔE/kT1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/kT2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get: -ΔE/kT1 = ln(2) + (-ΔE/kT2). Rearranging gives: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Therefore, the correct relationship between the temperatures T1 and T2 is: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

In this problem, we are told that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. This means that the ratio of the excited states in star_1 to star_2 is 2, or (N2_1/N1_1) / (N2_2/N1_2) = 2. Assuming the statistical weights (g2/g1) are the same for both stars, the equation becomes exp(-ΔE/kT1) / exp(-ΔE/kT2) = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1). This can be rearranged to find a relationship between T1 and T2. The correct choice corresponds to this logarithmic relationship.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent maRM, determining relationship, thinking: The problem states that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in the ground state is given by N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/kT). For star_1, this ratio is 2 times that for star_2. Therefore, we have: (N2/N1)_1 = 2 * (N2/N1)_2. Assuming the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both stars, this simplifies to: exp(-ΔE/kT1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/kT2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: -ΔE/kT1 = ln(2) - ΔE/kT2. Solving for ln(2) gives: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1). However, since the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, this can be simplified to the form ln(2) = ΔE/k * (T2 - T1) / (T1*T2), which is the form seen in option D.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent asVM, determining relationship, thinking: We know from the problem that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2.
