If the statistical weights g are equal, they cancel, leaving n_excited/n_ground = exp(–ΔE/(kT)).

The problem states the two levels have equal statistical weights (g_upper=g_lower), so those factors cancel, leaving just exp(–ΔE/(kT)). We then write this separately for each star (i=1,2): N_i,upper/N_i,lower = exp(–ΔE/(kT_i)). This expresses how the excitation depends on the star’s temperature in LTE.; answer: For each star i (i=1,2), since g_upper=g_lower, the Boltzmann population ratio is N_{i,upper}/N_{i,lower} = exp(–ΔE/(k\u2009T_i)). Thus:\nStar 1: N_{1,upper}/N_{1,lower}=exp(–ΔE/(k\u2009T_1))\nStar 2: N_{2,upper}/N_{2,lower}=exp(–ΔE/(k\u2009T_2))\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent SubD, forming ratio expression, thinking: To form the ratio of the two stars’ Boltzmann factors, we take\n(n_j/n_i)_1/(n_j/n_i)_2 = exp(–ΔE/(kT_1)) / exp(–ΔE/(kT_2)) = exp[ΔE/k (1/T_2 – 1/T_1)] = 2.\nTaking the natural log gives ln(2) = ΔE/k·(1/T_2 – 1/T_1).

Numerically ΔE/k=(1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J)/(1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J/K)=1\u2009K, reducing the relation to ln2 = 1/T₂–1/T₁, which rearranges to ln2 = (T₁–T₂)/(T₁·T₂).
