Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The correct relationship between the effective temperatures T1 and T2, given that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 and using the Boltzmann distribution under LTE, is derived as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Ignoring the constant factor ΔE/k (since it is not included in the provided choices), this simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). Among the given options, only choice D matches this exact form. The other choices either have incorrect terms such as addition instead of subtraction, incorrect powers, or incorrect placement of temperatures. Therefore, choice D is the correct equation representing the relationship between T1 and T2.
