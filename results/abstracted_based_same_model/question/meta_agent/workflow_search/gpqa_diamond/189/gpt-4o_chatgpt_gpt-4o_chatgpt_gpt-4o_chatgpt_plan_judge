Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: All agents agree on the order of nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution: Ethanethiolate, Hydroxide, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, Propionate, Methanol. This order is based on factors such as charge, electronegativity, steric hindrance, and solvation. Negatively charged nucleophiles are generally more reactive, with ethanethiolate being particularly strong due to sulfur's lower electronegativity compared to oxygen. Hydroxide is also a strong nucleophile due to its charge and small size, which allows for strong solvation. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a strong nucleophile but is slightly hindered by its structure. Propionate, being resonance-stabilized, is less nucleophilic, and methanol, being neutral, is the least reactive. This order corresponds to choice 1: 5, 2, 1, 3, and 4.
