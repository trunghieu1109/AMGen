Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The introduction of the electron beam increases the frequency of collisions between electrons and gas molecules, which effectively reduces the mean free path of the gas molecules. In the ultra-high vacuum state, without the beam, λ1 is determined by the low pressure and temperature, resulting in a large mean free path due to infrequent collisions. However, with the electron beam active, additional scattering events occur, leading to a shorter mean free path. This analysis aligns with the conclusion that the mean free path λ2, when the electron beam is active, is shorter than λ1. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
