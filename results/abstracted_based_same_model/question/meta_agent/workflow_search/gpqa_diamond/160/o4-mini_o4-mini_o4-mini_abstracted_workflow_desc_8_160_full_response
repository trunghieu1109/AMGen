Since σ_e<σ_m (electrons are much smaller and their collision cross section with gas molecules is lower than the molecule–molecule collision cross section), the denominator n·σ_e is smaller than n·σ_m, so λ2=1/(n·σ_e) must exceed λ1=1/(n·σ_m).

Moreover, typical electron–gas cross-sections are an order of magnitude smaller (≈10^–20\u2009m² vs ≈10^–19\u2009m²), so λ2 not only exceeds λ1 but comfortably exceeds the 1.22·λ1 threshold.

Since λ=1/(n·σ), a smaller σ_e–g yields a larger λ2 than λ1. Numerically, σ_e–g≈10^–20\u2009m² versus σ_m≈10^–19\u2009m² gives λ2≈10·λ1, which far exceeds 1.22·λ1. Therefore λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 82cF, round 0, thinking: Given that the electron–gas collision cross section is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the molecular collision cross section, the electron mean free path λ2 is correspondingly about ten times λ1, which far exceeds 1.22·λ1. This directly matches choice D.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent tqMt, round 0, thinking: The electron–gas collision cross section σ_e–g at 1000\u2009kV is much smaller than the molecular collision cross section σ_m, so λ2=1/(n·σ_e–g) is correspondingly larger than λ1=1/(n·σ_m). With σ_e–g roughly an order of magnitude smaller, λ2≈10·λ1, which clearly exceeds 1.22·λ1.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 9vbB, round 0, thinking: We concluded from the electron–gas collision cross sections that λ2 is much larger than λ1, specifically λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1. In the original multiple‐choice options, choice4 (letter D) corresponds exactly to λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1. Hence the correct mapping is D).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent MwMR, round 0, thinking: The electron–gas collision cross-section at 1000 kV is an order of magnitude smaller than the molecular collision cross-section, so λ2≈1/(n·σ_e–g)≈10·λ1≫1.22·λ1. This matches choice D).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, thinking: Since the electron–gas collision cross section at 1000 kV is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the molecular collision cross section, the electron mean free path λ2 ≈ 1/(n·σ_e–g) is about ten times the molecular mean free path λ1. This clearly exceeds the threshold 1.22·λ1, matching choice D) λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.; answer: D)", iteration_idx=-1)]
