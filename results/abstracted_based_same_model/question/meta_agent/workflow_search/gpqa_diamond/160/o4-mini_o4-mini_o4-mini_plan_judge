Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_160
proposed answer: The electron–molecule scattering cross section is smaller than the molecule–molecule cross section, so λ2/λ1 = σ1/σ2 > 1. Empirical values give σ1/σ2 ≥ 1.22, hence λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1, which matches choice 4 in the original list, i.e. D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_160
proposed answer: Since the electron–gas collision cross section at 1000 kV is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the molecular collision cross section, the electron mean free path λ2 ≈ 1/(n·σ_e–g) is about ten times the molecular mean free path λ1. This clearly exceeds the threshold 1.22·λ1, matching choice D) λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.
