Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_187
proposed answer: For a rhombohedral cell with a=10 Å and α=β=γ=30°, the interplanar spacing for (111) simplifies to d₁₁₁ = a·√((1+2cos30°)/3) = 10·√((1+√3)/3) ≈ 9.543 Å. Among the options (9.54, 8.95, 9.08, 10.05 Å), 9.54 Å (choice A) is the closest match.
