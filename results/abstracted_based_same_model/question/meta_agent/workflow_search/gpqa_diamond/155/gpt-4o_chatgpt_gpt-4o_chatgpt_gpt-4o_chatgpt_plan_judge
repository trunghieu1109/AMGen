Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_39_155
proposed answer: In a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated into distinct peaks. Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene produces a trans-diol, which has two enantiomers. Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a cis-diol, which also has two enantiomers. Therefore, the combined product mixture contains four distinct stereoisomers: two enantiomers of the trans-diol and two enantiomers of the cis-diol. Since chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers, four peaks will be observed, corresponding to each stereoisomer.

proposed answer: The combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct diol products: two enantiomers from the (E)-oct-4-ene reaction and one meso compound from the (Z)-oct-4-ene reaction. A chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers, so the two enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being achiral, will appear as a separate peak. Thus, on a chiral HPLC column, we expect to observe three distinct peaks: one for each enantiomer and one for the meso compound.
