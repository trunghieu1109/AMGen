For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation will give a single stereoisomer of the epoxide because the (E) configuration leads to a specific stereochemistry in the epoxide ring. Upon aqueous acid treatment, the epoxide ring opens to form a trans-diol. Since the starting alkene is (E), the diol formed will be meso (achiral) due to internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid gives one stereoisomeric product, which is meso and achiral.; answer - One stereoisomeric product (meso diol) is formed from (E)-oct-4-ene after epoxidation and acid treatment.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA proceeds similarly via a concerted mechanism, preserving the stereochemistry of the double bond.

The (Z) configuration leads to a different stereochemical outcome compared to the (E) isomer. Upon epoxidation and subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening, the product is a pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture) because the ring opening of the epoxide derived from (Z)-alkene gives a chiral diol without an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, the reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid gives two stereoisomeric products which are enantiomers.; answer: Two stereoisomeric products (enantiomeric pair) are formed from (Z)-oct-4-ene after epoxidation and acid treatment.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent BeAU, determining stereochemical outcome of (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA proceeds similarly via a concerted mechanism, preserving the stereochemistry of the double bond.

However, unlike the (E) isomer, the (Z) configuration leads to the formation of a pair of enantiomeric epoxides due to the different spatial arrangement of substituents. Upon aqueous acid treatment, the epoxide ring opens to form a diol, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by acid treatment results in two stereoisomeric products (enantiomers). Combining this with the (E)-oct-4-ene reaction, which gives one meso diol (achiral), the mixture contains three stereoisomeric products: one meso diol from (E) and two enantiomers from (Z).; answer: Two stereoisomeric products (enantiomers) are formed from (Z)-oct-4-ene after epoxidation and acid treatment.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent MuWL, combining stereoisomeric products, thinking: From Sub-task 1, the (E)-oct-4-ene reaction produces one stereoisomeric product, a meso diol which is achiral.

However, the limitation is that this analysis assumes complete and exclusive formation of these stereoisomers without considering any possible minor side products or incomplete reactions. Additionally, it assumes that the meso diol is truly achiral and does not separate on a chiral column, and that the enantiomers are perfectly resolved on the chiral HPLC. In practice, factors such as overlapping peaks, impurities, or partial resolution could affect the observed chromatograms.; answer: 3\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent MuWL, refining combined stereoisomeric species, thinking: The (E)-oct-4-ene reaction produces one stereoisomeric product, a meso diol which is achiral.
