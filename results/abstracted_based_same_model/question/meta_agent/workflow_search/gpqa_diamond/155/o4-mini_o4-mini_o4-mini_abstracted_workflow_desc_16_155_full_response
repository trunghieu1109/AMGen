Upon aqueous acid workup, the protonated epoxide undergoes anti ring opening by water at either carbon; however, because the starting epoxide is symmetric, attack at C4 or C5 both lead to the same anti‐configured vicinal diol with opposite stereochemistry at C4 and C5. This diol is superimposable on its mirror image (one center R, the other S), i.e., it is the meso‐4,5‐octanediol. No enantiomeric pair is formed, only the single meso compound.; answer - meso-4,5-octanediol\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The (Z)-alkene is symmetric (both alkene carbons bear identical n-propyl substituents). mCPBA epoxidizes via syn addition: for a Z-alkene this places the two identical substituents syn in the epoxide, giving a meso epoxide. Subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening proceeds via anti addition to yield the trans-1,2-diol. Since the starting epoxide is meso, the trans-diol is also meso (achiral) and there is only one product.; answer - meso-1,2-octanediol\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - For subtask 1, epoxidation of the (E)-alkene gives a trans-epoxide with two chiral centers but no internal plane of symmetry, so the reaction yields both enantiomers (an enantiomeric pair). For subtask 2, epoxidation of the (Z)-alkene places identical substituents syn and creates an internal mirror plane in the epoxide, so the single product is an achiral meso compound.; answer - Subtask 1 epoxide: enantiomeric pair. Subtask 2 epoxide: achiral meso compound.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The (E)-alkene gives a racemic pair of epoxides which co-elute as one peak on an achiral column; the (Z)-alkene gives an achiral meso epoxide that elutes separately.

Subtask 2 epoxide: achiral meso compound.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent l5Nh, classifying epoxide chirality, thinking: Each epoxidation is a syn addition to a symmetric alkene. For (E)-oct-4-ene, syn delivery to opposite faces of the substituents yields an epoxide bearing one face substituent down and one up, which corresponds to a meso epoxide (an internal mirror plane makes it achiral). For (Z)-oct-4-ene, syn delivery puts both identical substituents on the same face, but because the substituents are identical and you again generate one up/one down arrangement relative to the future C–C bond axis, the product is likewise a meso epoxide. In neither case is there a pair of non‐superimposable enantiomers—each epoxide has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.; answer: Both epoxide products are achiral meso compounds.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent dvuM, classifying epoxide chirality, thinking: Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene generates a trans-epoxide with two different substituent environments and lacks an internal mirror plane, so the product is formed as a racemic pair of enantiomers. In contrast, epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a cis-epoxide that has an internal plane of symmetry (the two substituents are identical and syn to each other), so a single achiral meso epoxide is obtained.; answer: (E)-oct-4-ene epoxide: enantiomeric pair; (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxide: meso compound.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 4YNp, predicting standard HPLC peaks, thinking: The (E)-alkene gives a racemic pair of epoxides which co-elute as one peak on an achiral column; the (Z)-alkene gives an achiral meso epoxide that elutes separately.
