Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The combined product mixture from the two reactions consists of three stereoisomeric species: one meso diol (achiral) from the (E)-oct-4-ene reaction and two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) from the (Z)-oct-4-ene reaction. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated into two distinct peaks because the chiral stationary phase can differentiate between them. The meso diol, being achiral, appears as a single peak. Therefore, the total number of peaks observed on the chiral HPLC column with maximum theoretical resolution is three.
