To compute total ΔH we must assume or know this value. Using the standard −57 kJ/mol and 0.2 mol H2O gives −11.4 kJ (−2.72 kcal). Without a provided ΔH° per mole, the result is based on an assumption.; answer: −11.4 kJ (−2.72 kcal)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the standard enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H2O formed to complete the calculation.\nCritic agent Lepj, on reviewing enthalpy change, thinking: The reasoning correctly determines the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) and OH⁻ (0.20 mol), identifies OH⁻ as limiting, and thus 0.20 mol H₂O is formed. It then applies the standard enthalpy of neutralization (–57 kJ/mol) to get ΔH = 0.20 mol × –57 kJ/mol = –11.4 kJ (–2.72 kcal). The only missing piece was to explicitly state the standard ΔH° of neutralization before using it.; answer: –11.4 kJ (–2.72 kcal)\nReflexion agent Lh6k, on refining enthalpy change, thinking: Total H+ from HCl (0.10 mol) and H2SO4 (0.09×2=0.18 mol) is 0.28 mol. Total OH– from Ba(OH)2 is 0.10×2=0.20 mol, so OH– is limiting, forming 0.20 mol H2O. Using standard ΔH°neut of –57 kJ/mol gives ΔH = 0.20×(–57 kJ/mol) = –11.4 kJ (–2.72 kcal).; answer: -11.4 kJ (−2.72 kcal)\nCritic agent Lepj, on reviewing enthalpy change, thinking: The stoichiometry and use of the standard enthalpy of neutralization (–57 kJ/mol) are correct. With 0.20 mol H₂O formed, ΔH = 0.20×(–57 kJ/mol) = –11.4 kJ (–2.72 kcal). It is best reported in kJ as –11.4 kJ. No further data are needed.; answer: –11.4 kJ (–2.72 kcal)\nReflexion agent Lh6k, on refining enthalpy change, thinking: Total H+ moles: 0.10 (HCl) + 0.09×2 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol. Total OH– moles: 0.10×2 = 0.20 mol, so OH– limits H2O formation: 0.20 mol.
