        "In Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome (47,XXY), one X chromosome is largely silenced by the XIST lncRNA followed by recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes, deposition of repressive histone marks (e.g., H3K27me3) and DNA methylation to form facultative heterochromatin and buffer gene dosage. In Down\u2019s syndrome (trisomy 21), no equivalent dosage-compensation mechanism exists for autosomes, so the extra chromosome remains transcriptionally active, resulting in overexpression of multiple genes and more pronounced phenotypic consequences.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
