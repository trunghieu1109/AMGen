Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Sub-task 1 established that Klinefelter’s syndrome involves an extra X chromosome whose dosage is buffered by X-inactivation, whereas Down’s syndrome involves an extra autosome without any inactivation mechanism. Sub-task 2 detailed that X-inactivation is mediated by XIST RNA coating the X, recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 for H3K27 trimethylation, and DNA methylation to form a Barr body. In contrast, trisomy 21 lacks a chromosome-wide silencing process, leaving all three copies transcriptionally active and causing a broader gene-dosage imbalance.

Answer:In Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY), the supernumerary X chromosome is largely silenced by the X-inactivation pathway: XIST noncoding RNA coats the extra X, recruits Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to deposit H3K27me3, and induces promoter CpG DNA methylation to compact it into a Barr body, reducing X-linked gene overexpression. In Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21), no analogous chromosome-wide inactivation exists, so all three copies of chromosome 21 remain transcriptionally active, leading to a greater gene-dosage imbalance and more pronounced phenotypic consequences.

proposed answer: The comparison contrasts the established X-chromosome dosage-compensation mechanism in XXY males versus the lack of any analogous mechanism for an extra autosome in trisomy 21. The extra X is largely silenced via XIST RNA and repressive chromatin modifications, whereas the third chromosome 21 remains active, leading to gene overexpression.

Answer:In Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY), one X chromosome is largely silenced by the XIST lncRNA followed by recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes, deposition of repressive histone marks (e.g., H3K27me3) and DNA methylation to form facultative heterochromatin and buffer gene dosage. In Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21), no equivalent dosage-compensation mechanism exists for autosomes, so the extra chromosome remains transcriptionally active, resulting in overexpression of multiple genes and more pronounced phenotypic consequences.
