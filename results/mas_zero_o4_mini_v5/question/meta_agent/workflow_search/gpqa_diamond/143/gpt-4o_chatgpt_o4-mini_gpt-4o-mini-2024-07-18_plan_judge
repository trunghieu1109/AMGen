Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Using τ = ħ/Γ ≃ 6.58×10⁻²² MeV·s / 320 MeV ≃ 2.06×10⁻²⁴ s and γ = 8/1.2 ≃ 6.67, the mean decay distance is d = c·τ·γ ≃ 3×10⁸ m/s × 2.06×10⁻²⁴ s × 6.67 ≃ 4.11×10⁻¹⁵ m, which corresponds to choice C).
