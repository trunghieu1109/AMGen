Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 87_Iteration_0
proposed answer: High variability in the variable heavy chain gene of B cells in Peyerâ€™s patches is introduced by point mutations during germinal center reactions, characteristic of somatic hypermutation.
