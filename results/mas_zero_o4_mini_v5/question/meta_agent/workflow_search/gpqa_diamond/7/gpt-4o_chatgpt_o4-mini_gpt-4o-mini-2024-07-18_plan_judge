Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Based on sub-task 1, G2 knockout abolishes resistance, identifying it as the upstream transcription factor. Sub-task 2 shows g1g2 and g2g3 phenocopy g2, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The strong reduction in g1g3 versus singles indicates G1 and G3 act in parallel, partially redundant pathways. No multiple-trait effects were measured, so no evidence for pleiotropy.

Answer:G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act in partially redundant parallel pathways; no evidence of pleiotropy under the tested conditions.
Extracted answer: G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act in partially redundant parallel pathways; no evidence of pleiotropy under the tested conditions.

proposed answer: From sub-task 1, g2 knockout abolishes resistance, identifying G2 as the key transcription factor. From sub-task 2, the g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants phenocopy g2, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The g1g3 double shows a more severe defect than either single, indicating redundant functions of G1 and G3. There’s no sign of pleiotropy since all phenotypes relate to the same resistance trait.

Answer:G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act redundantly; no evidence for pleiotropy.
