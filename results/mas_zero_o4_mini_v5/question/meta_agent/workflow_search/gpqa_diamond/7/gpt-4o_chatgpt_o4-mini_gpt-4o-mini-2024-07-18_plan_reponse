            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

Sub-task 2 shows g1g2 and g2g3 phenocopy g2, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The strong reduction in g1g3 versus singles indicates G1 and G3 act in parallel, partially redundant pathways. No multiple-trait effects were measured, so no evidence for pleiotropy.\n\nAnswer:G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act in partially redundant parallel pathways; no evidence of pleiotropy under the tested conditions.",

From sub-task 2, the g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants phenocopy g2, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The g1g3 double shows a more severe defect than either single, indicating redundant functions of G1 and G3.
