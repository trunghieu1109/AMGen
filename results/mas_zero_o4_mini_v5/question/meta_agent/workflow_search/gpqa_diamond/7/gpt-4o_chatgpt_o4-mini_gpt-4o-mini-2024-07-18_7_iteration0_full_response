Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=0)

The g1g3 mutant shows only 10% resistance, much lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%), indicating that G1 and G3 have partially redundant functions rather than a strict linear pathway (no clear epistasis between them).\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Cc5z:\nIn the double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 phenotypes match g2, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3; the g1g3 phenotype is more severe than either single, indicating partial redundancy between G1 and G3.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, draw conclusions on gene redundancy, pleiotropy, and epistatic interactions.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent tpUs, on the purpose of analyzing single mutants, thinking: We examine single-mutant resistance: g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential and likely the transcription factor upstream. g3 has 50% resistance, a moderate effect, and g1 has 75%, a minor effect.; answer: G2 is most likely the transcription factor because its knockout abolishes resistance, while G3 and G1 have partial effects.\nCoT-SC agent Cc5z, on the purpose of analyzing double mutants, thinking: We examine double-mutant phenotypes: g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, matching the g2 single mutant, so G2’s knockout masks the effects of G1 and G3 (G2 is epistatic to both). The g1g3 mutant shows only 10% resistance, much lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%), indicating that G1 and G3 have partially redundant functions rather than a strict linear pathway (no clear epistasis between them).; answer: In the double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 phenotypes match g2, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3; the g1g3 phenotype is more severe than either single, indicating partial redundancy between G1 and G3.\nCoT-SC agent yai1, on the purpose of analyzing double mutants, thinking: The double-mutant data show that g1g2 and g2g3 both yield 0% resistance (same as g2 alone), indicating G2’s knockout masks effects of G1 and G3. However, g1g3 gives 10%, which is more severe than either single, suggesting additive or complex interaction rather than classic epistasis. Additional data (e.g., time-course pathogen assays, expression profiling) are needed to conclusively define which gene is epistatic or whether they act redundantly.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide time-course resistance measurements or gene expression data for the double mutants to clarify the epistatic relationships.\nCoT-SC agent FTju, on the purpose of analyzing double mutants, thinking: The double mutants show that g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, matching the g2 single mutant, indicating G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The g1g3 double mutant has only 10% resistance, much lower than either single mutant (75% and 50%), indicating that G1 and G3 act redundantly or additively to confer resistance rather than in a simple linear pathway.; answer: G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act redundantly to contribute to resistance.\nReflexion CoT agent OaCI, initial attempt, thinking: From sub-task 1, g2 knockout abolishes resistance, identifying G2 as the key transcription factor.
