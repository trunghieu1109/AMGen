Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 41_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Given equal albedo and same host star, equilibrium temperature scales as T_eq ∝ a^(–1/2) and by Kepler’s third law P ∝ a^(3/2), hence P ∝ T_eq^(–3). With T1/T3 ≈ 3.22, we compute P3/P1 = (T1/T3)^3 ≈ 3.22^3 ≈ 33.4.

Answer:The refined orbital period ratio P3/P1 is approximately 33.4.
Extracted answer: The refined orbital period ratio P3/P1 is approximately 33.4.
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 41_Iteration_0
proposed answer: We use the refined equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T3≈3.22, giving a3/a1=(T1/T3)^2≈10.37, and then apply Kepler’s third law P3/P1=(a3/a1)^(3/2)≈3.22^3≈33.4.
