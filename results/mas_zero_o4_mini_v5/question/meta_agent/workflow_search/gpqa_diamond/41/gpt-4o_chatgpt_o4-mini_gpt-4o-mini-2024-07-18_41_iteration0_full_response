From T1/T3=(T1/T2)(T2/T3)=1.4×2.3≈3.22, we get P3/P1=(T1/T3)^3≈3.22^3≈33.4, which is consistent.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Refine the calculation of the orbital period ratio based on feedback and previous attempts. \n\n ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent kOjg (yourself):\nUsing the equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T3 ≈ (T1/T2)*(T2/T3) = 1.4*2.3 ≈ 3.22, and knowing T ∝ a^(-1/2) so a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2, then P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (T1/T3)^3 ≈ 3.22^3 ≈ 33.4.\n\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent kOjg (yourself):\nB)\n\n### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the calculation of the orbital period ratio. \n\n ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent FXLU:\nThe derivation is sound. You correctly used T∝a^(–1/2) to get a3/a1=(T1/T3)^2, then applied Kepler’s third law P∝a^(3/2) to find P3/P1=(a3/a1)^(3/2)=(T1/T3)^3≈3.22^3≈33.4.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Refine the calculation of the orbital period ratio based on feedback and previous attempts. \n\n ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent kOjg (yourself):\nUsing the refined equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T3 ≈3.22 gives a3/a1=(T1/T3)^2≈10.37.
