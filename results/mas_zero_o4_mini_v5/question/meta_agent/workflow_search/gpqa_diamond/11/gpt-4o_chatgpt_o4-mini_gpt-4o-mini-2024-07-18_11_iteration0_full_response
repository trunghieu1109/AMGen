Taking m_nu≈0 gives E_mu≈(139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2·139.6)≈109.8 MeV.

In fact, carrying out the decay‐at‐rest formula gives E_μ≈(m_π²+m_μ²)/(2m_π)≈109.8 MeV, so KE_μ≈109.8–105.7≈4.1 MeV.; answer: False\nCoT agent 0UjO, on the purpose of refining KE of mu(+), thinking: Using two-body decay at rest, E_μ = (m_π^2 + m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) ≈ (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≈109.75 MeV.

With more precise masses you find KE_μ≈4.12\u2009MeV. Thus the 4.05\u2009MeV result is only a minor rounding‐error and not exactly the standard value.; answer: False\nCoT agent 0UjO, on the purpose of refining KE of mu(+), thinking: Using two-body decay at rest: E_μ=(m_π²+m_μ²)/(2 m_π) with m_π=139.6\u2009MeV, m_μ=105.7\u2009MeV gives E_μ≈(139.6²+105.7²)/(2·139.6)≈109.75\u2009MeV.
