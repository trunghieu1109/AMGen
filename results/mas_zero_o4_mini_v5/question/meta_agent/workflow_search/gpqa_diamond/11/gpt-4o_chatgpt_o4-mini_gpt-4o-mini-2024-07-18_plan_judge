Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 11_Iteration_0
proposed answer: In the pion rest frame, total energy is m_πc²=139.6 MeV. From sub-task 3 the muon’s total energy is E_μ=m_μc²+KE_μ=105.7+4.12=109.82 MeV. By energy conservation the neutrino’s energy (all kinetic) is 139.6−109.82≈29.8 MeV.

Answer:29.8 MeV
Extracted answer: 29.8 MeV
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 11_Iteration_0
proposed answer: In a two-body decay π+→μ+ν at rest, the neutrino’s kinetic energy equals its total energy. Using Eν = (mπ² – mμ²)/(2mπ) ≈ (139.6² – 105.7²)/(2·139.6) ≈ 29.8 MeV, which corresponds to choice D.
