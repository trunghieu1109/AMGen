Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output from sub-task 3, calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent mTma:
The neutrino kinetic energy in the π+ → μ+ + ν decay at rest is Eν = (mπ² – mμ²)/(2 mπ) ≈ 29.8 MeV, which corresponds to choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent 30ek:
Given the muon’s total energy E_μ = m_μ + KE_μ = 105.7 + 4.12 = 109.82 MeV, energy conservation gives E_ν = m_π – E_μ = 139.6 – 109.82 ≈ 29.78 MeV. With negligible neutrino mass, KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV.

### thinking by Debate Agent o5xY:
In a two-body decay at rest, the neutrino kinetic energy is E_ν=(m_π²–m_μ²)/(2m_π)≈(139.6²–105.7²)/(2·139.6)≈29.8 MeV, which corresponds to choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent BxVM:
In the two-body decay π+→μ+ν at rest, the neutrino kinetic energy equals its total energy since its mass is negligible. Energy conservation gives E_ν=(m_π²−m_μ²)/(2m_π)≈(139.6²−105.7²)/(2·139.6)≈29.8 MeV.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output from sub-task 3, finalize the KE of neutrino.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
