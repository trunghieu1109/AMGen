Ac2O converts the acid to the mixed anhydride, enolizes, and Br2 then brominates the α-carbon. Hydrolysis regenerates the acid, giving α-bromoacetic acid.; answer: Product 1 is 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\nCoT agent yZ17, on the purpose of determining product 2, thinking: Esterification of 2-bromoacetic acid with ethanol under acidic conditions gives the ethyl ester.; answer: Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt)\nCoT-SC agent qmGE, on the purpose of determining product 3, thinking: Ethyl 2-bromoacetate undergoes SN2 with cyanide to replace bromide with –CN, yielding ethyl cyanoacetate.; answer: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC–CH2–COOEt)\nCoT-SC agent eoy5, on the purpose of determining product 3, thinking: Ethyl 2-bromoacetate undergoes SN2 with CN–, displacing Br to yield ethyl 2-cyanoacetate.; answer: Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NC–CH₂–COOEt)\nCoT-SC agent Cp29, on the purpose of determining product 3, thinking: Sodium cyanide displaces the bromide on the α-carbon of the ester via an SN2 reaction, converting BrCH2COOEt into NCCH2COOEt.; answer: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOEt)\nCoT agent XlPP, on the purpose of determining product 4, thinking: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC–CH2–COOEt) is doubly deprotonated at the methylene to give a carbanion that first attacks one bromide of 1,5-dibromopentane, then intramolecular SN2 onto the terminal bromide to form a six-membered ring. The result is a cyclohexane bearing the –CN and –COOEt substituents on the same carbon.; answer: Ethyl 2-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\nCritic agent 6ZBS, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The proposed product structure is misnamed and likely incorrect. After dialkylation and intramolecular cyclization with 1,5-dibromopentane, the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate becomes part of a cyclohexane ring and carries both the ester and cyano substituents at the same carbon. Properly named, the product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, not ethyl 2-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.; answer: False\nCoT agent XlPP, on the purpose of refining product 4, thinking: Dialkylation at the methylene of ethyl cyanoacetate with 1,5-dibromopentane followed by intramolecular SN2 yields a cyclohexane ring in which the ester and cyano substituents are on the same carbon. By IUPAC numbering that carbon is C-1, so the correct structure is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, not ethyl 2-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.; answer: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\nCritic agent 6ZBS, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The proposed structure, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, correctly reflects intramolecular cyclization of the deprotonated ethyl cyanoacetate onto the terminal bromide of 1,5-dibromopentane, yielding a cyclohexane ring bearing both nitrile and ester substituents on C-1.; answer: True\nDebate agent gAWw, round 0, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. The cyclohexane ring has five CH2 carbons (C2–C6), each bearing two diastereotopic protons (10 signals). The ethyl ester contributes two diastereotopic CH2 protons (2 signals) and one CH3 signal. Total = 10+2+1 = 13 distinct 1H NMR signals.; answer: The final product has 13 distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\nDebate agent 0yYV, round 0, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. Ignoring diastereotopic splitting, the ring has five distinct CH2 environments (C2–C6) plus one CH at C1, and the ethyl ester contributes one CH2 and one CH3 environment: total 5+1+1+1 = 8 distinct 1H NMR signals.; answer: 8\nDebate agent Pa5w, round 0, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, a chiral, tetrasubstituted cyclohexane. All five ring CH2 groups are inequivalent (5 signals). The ester CH2’s are diastereotopic (2 signals) and the CH3 gives one signal. Total = 5+2+1 = 8.; answer: D)\nDebate agent fa1z, round 0, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4. Equivalent CH2 groups: C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4. Plus the ethyl CH2 and CH3. Counting each carbon’s hydrogens as one signal gives five distinct 1H NMR signals.; answer: 5\nDebate agent gAWw, round 1, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: The official correct choice given is choice3 corresponding to 5 distinct signals.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 0yYV, round 1, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, which has a stereocenter at C1. Each of the five ring CH2 carbons bears two diastereotopic protons (10 distinct signals), the ethyl CH2 is also diastereotopic (2 signals), and the ethyl CH3 gives one signal. Total distinct 1H NMR signals = 10 + 2 + 1 = 13.; answer: 13\nDebate agent Pa5w, round 1, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate is a chiral, tetrasubstituted cyclohexane with five inequivalent ring CH2 groups (5 signals), two diastereotopic ester CH2 protons (2 signals), and one methyl group (1 signal), giving a total of 8 distinct 1H NMR signals.; answer: 8\nDebate agent fa1z, round 1, on the purpose of determining NMR signals, thinking: The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.
