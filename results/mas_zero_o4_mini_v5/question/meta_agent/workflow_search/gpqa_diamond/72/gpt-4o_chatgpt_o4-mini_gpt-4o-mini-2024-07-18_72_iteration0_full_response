So E1=2m·1.25c²=2.5mc², E2=3m·1.1547c²≈3.4641mc². Total E≈5.9641mc²≈5.96mc².; answer: Total energy of the system ≈5.96\u2009mc²\nCritic agent yNqX, on reviewing energy calculation, feedback: The energy calculation is correct: you used γ1 = 1/√(1−0.6²) = 1.25 and γ2 = 1/√(1−0.5²) ≈ 1.1547 to find E1 = 2m·1.25c² = 2.5mc² and E2 = 3m·1.1547c² ≈ 3.4641mc², summing to ≈5.96mc².; correct: 5.96 mc^2\nCoT agent mJNA, on refining total energy calculation, thinking: We use relativistic energy E=γmc² for each astronaut: γ1=1/√(1−0.6²)=1.25 gives E1=2m·1.25c²=2.5mc²; γ2=1/√(1−0.5²)≈1.1547 gives E2=3m·1.1547c²≈3.4641mc². Sum E≈5.9641mc²≈5.96mc².; answer: Total energy of the system ≈ 5.96 mc²\nCritic agent yNqX, on reviewing energy calculation, feedback: The calculation correctly applies the relativistic energy formula E = γmc². For v = 0.6c, γ₁ = 1/√(1−0.36) = 1.25, giving E₁ = 2m·1.25c² = 2.5 mc². For v = 0.5c, γ₂ = 1/√(1−0.25) ≈ 1.1547, giving E₂ ≈ 3m·1.1547c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².
