Question: Example(question='benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.\nproduct 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.\nproduct 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.\nProduct 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.\nProduct 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.', choice1="3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl", choice2="3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl", choice3="4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl", choice4="3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl", correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 60_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The reaction sequence: benzene → nitrobenzene → 3-bromonitrobenzene → 3-bromoaniline → diazonium coupling with anisole gives 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.
