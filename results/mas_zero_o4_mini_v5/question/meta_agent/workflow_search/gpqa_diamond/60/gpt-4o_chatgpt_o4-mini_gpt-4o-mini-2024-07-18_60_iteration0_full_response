Br2 with Fe metal acts as a brominating reagent, yielding 3-bromonitrobenzene.; answer: 3-bromonitrobenzene\nCoT agent 3Q0W, on hydrogenation, thinking: Catalytic hydrogenation over Pd/C reduces the nitro group to an amine without affecting the aryl bromide, converting 3-bromonitrobenzene to 3-bromoaniline.; answer: 3-bromoaniline\nCoT agent Sh5D, on diazotization, thinking: NaNO2 and HBF4 convert an aniline into its diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.
