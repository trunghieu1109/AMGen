The large 16 Hz coupling indicates a trans-alkene. The dq at 5.5 ppm couples both to the trans-vinylic proton (J≈16 Hz) and to a methyl group (J≈7 Hz). The singlet at 2.1 ppm is characteristic of an acetyl methyl. The 1.6 ppm doublet arises from a methyl group attached to the alkene carbon.; answer: • 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz): trans-vinylic proton  \n• 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): second vinylic proton, coupling to trans partner (J≈16 Hz) and to a methyl (J≈7 Hz)  \n• 2.1 ppm (3H, s): acetyl methyl of an acetate group  \n• 1.6 ppm (3H, d): methyl group on the alkene carbon\nDebate agent Xjgq, round 0, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The large 16 Hz coupling constant indicates a trans-alkene.

Thus the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\nDebate agent SLAj, round 0, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The large 16 Hz coupling between the two vinylic protons indicates a trans‐alkene. The dq at 5.5 ppm coupling both to the trans partner and a methyl, plus the acetate methyl singlet at 2.1 ppm and alkene‐attached methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm, matches trans‐propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\nDebate agent 5VQY, round 0, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The large J coupling (16 Hz) indicates a trans alkene, and the methyl coupling at 1.6 ppm identifies a propenyl side chain rather than butenyl. The acetyl methyl singlet confirms an acetate. These features match Trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\nDebate agent WgV0, round 0, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The large J=16 Hz coupling between the two vinylic protons indicates a trans‐alkene. The dq at 5.5 ppm couples to the trans partner (J≈16 Hz) and to the methyl (J≈7 Hz), while the singlet at 2.1 ppm is the acetyl methyl and the doublet at 1.6 ppm is the alkene‐attached methyl. These features match trans‐propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\nDebate agent Xjgq, round 1, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The large J coupling of 16 Hz indicates a trans-alkene. The NMR data lacks any CH2 signal that would be present in butenyl acetate, pointing to propenyl acetate.
