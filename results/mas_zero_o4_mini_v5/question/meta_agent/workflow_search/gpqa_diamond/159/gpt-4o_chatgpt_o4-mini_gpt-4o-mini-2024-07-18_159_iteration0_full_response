A circular aperture of radius a yields the Airy diffraction pattern with minima at zeros of J1. The first two zeros are at x1≈3.8317 and x2≈7.0156, so θ1=x1λ/(2πa)≈0.610λ/a and θ2=x2λ/(2πa)≈1.116λ/a, giving Δθ≈0.506λ/a.; answer: As N→∞, the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far-field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, I(θ)∝[2J1(kaθ)/(kaθ)]2, with minima at kaθ equal to the zeros of J1 (x1≈3.8317, x2≈7.0156). Thus θ1≈x1λ/(2πa)≈0.610λ/a and θ2≈x2λ/(2πa)≈1.116λ/a, so the angular separation between the first two minima is Δθ≈0.506λ/a.\nCoT agent wZkl, on the purpose of deriving formula, thinking: For a circular aperture, minima occur at kaθ = x_n where x_n are zeros of J1. The first two zeros x1 and x2 give θ1 = x1λ/(2πa), θ2 = x2λ/(2πa). Thus the angular separation Δθ = θ2−θ1 = (x2−x1)λ/(2πa). Numerically (x2−x1)≈3.1839 giving ≈0.506λ/a.; answer: Δθ = (x2 − x1) λ ⁄ (2π a)\nCoT agent db2V, on the purpose of deriving formula, thinking: For a circular aperture of radius a, the minima occur where kaθ equals the zeros x₁,x₂ of J₁. Thus θ₁=x₁λ/(2πa), θ₂=x₂λ/(2πa), so the separation is Δθ=(x₂−x₁)λ/(2πa). Numerically x₁≈3.8317, x₂≈7.0156 giving Δθ≈0.506λ/a.; answer: Δθ = (x₂ − x₁) λ / (2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ / a\nCoT agent H0j9, on the purpose of deriving formula, thinking: For a circular aperture radius a, minima occur at kaθ = x_n (zeros of J1).
