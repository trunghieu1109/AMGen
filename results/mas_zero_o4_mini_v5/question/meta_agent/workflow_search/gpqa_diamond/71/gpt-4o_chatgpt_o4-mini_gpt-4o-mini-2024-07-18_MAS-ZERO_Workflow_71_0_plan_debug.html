Example(question=&#39;7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?&#39;, choice1=&#39;7&#39;, choice2=&#39;8&#39;, choice3=&#39;10&#39;, choice4=&#39;4&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, determine the structure of final product 4 after heating product 3 at 150°C. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent DBDs:
Heating the dialdehyde 3 at 150 °C should trigger an intramolecular aldol condensation between the two formyl groups, forging a new C–C bond and yielding a fused enone ring on the norbornane skeleton. However, without exo/endo stereochemical assignments or spectroscopic data for 3, the regiochemistry and configuration of the newly formed ring junction cannot be unambiguously determined.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent DBDs:
Best hypothesis: intramolecular aldol condensation of the two CHO groups in 3 affords a fused bicyclic enone on the norbornane core, closing a six-membered ring across the dialdehyde positions.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide exo/endo stereochemical assignments or NMR coupling constants for product 3 to confirm the cyclization regiochemistry and stereochemistry of 4.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on final product 4.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Without specific stereochemical details of the intramolecular aldol condensation product, assigning distinct hydrogen environments on the fused enone-norbornane system is ambiguous. I’m estimating based on a symmetric closure, giving about eight chemically distinct hydrogens, but stereochemistry (endo/exo configurations) could break or enforce additional equivalences.

Answer:8
