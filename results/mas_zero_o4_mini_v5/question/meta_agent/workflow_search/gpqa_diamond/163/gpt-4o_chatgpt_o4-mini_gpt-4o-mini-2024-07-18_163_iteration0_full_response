Use Kepler\'s third law and the radial velocity formula. \n\n ### thinking by CoT Agent for System 2 vgao:\nWe use Kepler’s third law combined with the radial‐velocity amplitudes. For a circular, edge‐on binary, the total semi‐major axis a = (P/2π)(K1+K2). Kepler’s law gives (2π/P)^2 a^3 = G(M1+M2), which leads to M1+M2 = [P (K1+K2)^3]/(2π G). Substituting P = 1\u2009yr ≃ 3.154×10^7\u2009s, K1+K2 = 25\u2009km/s = 2.5×10^4\u2009m/s, and G = 6.674×10^−11\u2009SI, gives Mtot ≃1.17×10^30\u2009kg, or ≃0.59\u2009M⊙.\n\n### answer by CoT Agent for System 2 vgao:\n1.17×10^30 kg (~0.6 M⊙)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT Agent for System 1, thinking: We estimate total mass using M=(P(K1+K2)^3)/(2πG).
