    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 0.4&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 0.7&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1.2&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the total mass of system_1 using its eclipse period and radial velocity amplitudes. Use Kepler&#39;s third law and the radial velocity formula. 

 ### thinking by CoT Agent for System 1 2TSu:
We estimate total mass using M=(P(K1+K2)^3)/(2πG). P=2 yr≈6.31×10^7 s; Ksum=15 km/s=1.5×10^4 m/s; G=6.67×10^-11 SI. Plug in: M≈6.31×10^7*(1.5×10^4)^3/(2π*6.67×10^-11)≈7.6×10^29 kg≈0.38 M☉.

### answer by CoT Agent for System 1 2TSu:
~0.38 M☉

### Sub-task 2: Calculate the total mass of system_2 using its eclipse period and radial velocity amplitudes. Use Kepler&#39;s third law and the radial velocity formula. 

 ### thinking by CoT Agent for System 2 vgao:
We use Kepler’s third law combined with the radial‐velocity amplitudes. For a circular, edge‐on binary, the total semi‐major axis a = (P/2π)(K1+K2). Kepler’s law gives (2π/P)^2 a^3 = G(M1+M2), which leads to M1+M2 = [P (K1+K2)^3]/(2π G). Substituting P = 1 yr ≃ 3.154×10^7 s, K1+K2 = 25 km/s = 2.5×10^4 m/s, and G = 6.674×10^−11 SI, gives Mtot ≃1.17×10^30 kg, or ≃0.59 M⊙.

### answer by CoT Agent for System 2 vgao:
1.17×10^30 kg (~0.6 M⊙)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From sub-task results, M1 ≈0.38 M⊙ and M2 ≈0.6 M⊙, so M1/M2≈0.38/0.6≈0.63, which is closest to ~0.6.
