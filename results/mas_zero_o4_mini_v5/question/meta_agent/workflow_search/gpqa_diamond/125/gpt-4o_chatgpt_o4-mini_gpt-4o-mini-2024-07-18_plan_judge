Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 125_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Sub-task 3 identified 5 distinct stereoisomeric products. A chiral HPLC will resolve all diastereomers and enantiomers into separate peaks, so 5 peaks are observed.

Answer:5 peaks
Extracted answer: 5 peaks
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 125_Iteration_0
proposed answer: There are 5 distinct stereoisomers total (2 from reaction I, 3 from reaction II). A chiral stationary phase separates all stereoisomers (diastereomers and enantiomers), so all 5 give separate peaks.

Answer:5
