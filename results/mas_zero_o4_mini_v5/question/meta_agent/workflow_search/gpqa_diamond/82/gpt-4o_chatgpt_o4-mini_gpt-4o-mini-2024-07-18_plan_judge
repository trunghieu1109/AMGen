Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We have accounted for dilution to 50 mL, calculated [A–]=0.001 mol/0.050 L=0.020 M. Using Kw=1.013×10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C and Ka=1.85×10⁻⁵ gives Kb=5.48×10⁻¹⁰. Solving x²/(C−x)=Kb (with x≪C) yields [OH⁻]≈√(Kb·C)=3.31×10⁻⁶ M, pOH≈5.48 and pH=14−5.48≈8.52.

Answer:At the equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52
Extracted answer: At the equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: All steps have been carefully vetted: [A⁻] = 0.00100 mol/0.05000 L = 0.0200 M; Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.00×10⁻¹⁴/1.85×10⁻⁵ = 5.405×10⁻¹⁰ (pKb = 9.267); pOH = ½(pKb – log C) = ½(9.267 – (–1.699)) = 5.483; pH = 14 – 5.483 = 8.52. The approximation x ≪ C holds, and volume changes are accounted for. No further correction needed.
