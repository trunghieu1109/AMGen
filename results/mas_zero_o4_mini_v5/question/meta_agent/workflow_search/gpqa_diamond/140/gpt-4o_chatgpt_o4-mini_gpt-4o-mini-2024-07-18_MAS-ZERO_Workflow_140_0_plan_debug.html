    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;3&#39;, choice3=&#39;1&#39;, choice4=&#39;2&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, enumerate all possible organic products from the reaction. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent J45f:
The benzyne intermediate can form by loss of D (at C2) or H (at C6). Deprotonation at C2 gives benzyne that upon NH2– addition at either carbon yields aniline (both modes give H substitution, no D). Deprotonation at C6 retains D at C2; addition at C1 gives NH2 at former C1 and D at C2 (2-deuteroaniline), addition at C6 gives NH2 at C6 and D at C2 (3-deuteroaniline). Thus three distinct products.

### thinking by Debate Agent KuFC:
Benzyne formation via removal of D (at C2) or H (at C6) and subsequent NH2– attack at either benzyne carbon yields three distinct products: unsubstituted aniline (D lost), 2-deuteroaniline (NH2 at original Br site, D retained at C2), and 4-deuteroaniline (NH2 at C6, D at C2).

### thinking by Debate Agent DgZE:
Elimination–addition via benzyne can occur by removal of D (at C2) or H (at C6), and NH2– can attack either benzyne carbon. Two of the four possible outcomes coincide, giving three distinct products.

### answer by Debate Agent J45f:
aniline; 2-deuteroaniline; 3-deuteroaniline

### answer by Debate Agent KuFC:
- aniline
- 2-deuteroaniline
- 4-deuteroaniline

### answer by Debate Agent DgZE:
1) Aniline (no D)
2) 2-Deuteroaniline
3) 4-Deuteroaniline

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, make a final decision on the possible organic products.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Removal of H at C6 retains D at C2 and gives a meta (3) deuteroaniline. Removal of D at C2 yields benzyne that leads to unsubstituted aniline. Removal of H at C6 then attack at C1 gives 2-deuteroaniline. Thus three distinct products.
