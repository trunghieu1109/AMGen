proposed answer: Agents 8vh5 and RRum predict four products by counting each attack pathway separately, but agents note that two pathways converge to the same isotopically labeled compound. Agent SrMf correctly groups identical isotopomers, yielding three unique products.

Answer:1) 1-Amino-2-deuterobenzene
2) 2-Aminobenzene (aniline)
3) 6-Amino-2-deuterobenzene
Extracted answer: 1) 1-Amino-2-deuterobenzene
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: Removal of H at C6 retains D at C2 and gives a meta (3) deuteroaniline. Removal of D at C2 yields benzyne that leads to unsubstituted aniline. Removal of H at C6 then attack at C1 gives 2-deuteroaniline. Thus three distinct products.

Answer:aniline; 2-deuteroaniline; 3-deuteroaniline
Extracted answer: aniline; 2-deuteroaniline; 3-deuteroaniline
Correct answer: 1
