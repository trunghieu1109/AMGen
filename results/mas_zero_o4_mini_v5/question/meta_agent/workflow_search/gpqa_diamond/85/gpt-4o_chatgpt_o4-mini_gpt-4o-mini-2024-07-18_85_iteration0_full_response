Intramolecular cyclization then converts the alcohol into the tetrahydropyranone. Numbering the ring makes the preserved (S) configuration at C3 of A appear as the (R) configuration at C4 of the product. Hence A must be the (S) acid and reduction gives (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.; answer: The reduction of A with LiBH4/H+ proceeds with retention of the original stereocenter, yielding the (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\nCoT-SC agent Ibuy, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome for compound B, thinking: Borane (BH3) reduction of the carboxylic acid in B proceeds via a cyclic boronate intermediate that delivers hydride syn to the ether substituent, leading to retention of configuration at C-4. This gives the (S)-configured tetrahydropyranone.; answer: The reaction yields (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\nCoT-SC agent 7AqX, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome for compound B, thinking: The original problem identifies compound B as the (R)-acid. BH3 reduces carboxylic acids by complexation to the oxygen followed by hydride delivery anti to the bulky substituent, inverting the stereocenter. Lactonization then gives the tetrahydropyranone. Thus an (R)-acid gives the (S)-lactone.; answer: The reaction of (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (B) with BH3 and H+ proceeds with inversion at the stereocenter, yielding (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\nCoT-SC agent 5c8S, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome for compound B, thinking: Compound B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Reduction with BH3 proceeds via intramolecular delivery of hydride and cyclization to give the lactone with inversion at the reaction center, yielding the (S)-configured product.; answer: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nDebate agent KBtf, on the purpose of selecting starting materials, thinking: Sub-task 1 requires A to be the (S)-acid and sub-task 2 requires B to be the (R)-acid, which corresponds to choice 1, i.e. option A).; answer: A)\nDebate agent tqwS, on the purpose of selecting starting materials, thinking: Sub-task 1 requires A to be the (S)-acid; sub-task 2 requires B to be the (S)-acid.
