Since no particles are found at x<1 or x>3, the wave function must be nonzero only for 1≤x≤3 and zero elsewhere.; answer: Particles are confined to the region 1 ≤ x ≤ 3; outside this interval the probability density is zero.\nCoT agent bLDo, on the purpose of deriving probability density, thinking: To get the probability density, compute the modulus squared of ψ(x): |ψ|^2 = [Re(ψ)]^2 + [Im(ψ)]^2. Here Re(ψ)=a/√(1+x), Im(ψ)=-0.5. Thus p(x)=a^2/(1+x)+0.25 on the domain 1≤x≤3, zero elsewhere.; answer: p(x)=|ψ(x)|^2 = \\begin{cases}a^2/(1+x)+0.25,&1\\le x\\le3\\\\0,&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}\nCoT agent ctX7, on the purpose of deriving probability density, thinking: The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function: |ψ(x)|² = [Re\u2009ψ(x)]² + [Im\u2009ψ(x)]². Here Re\u2009ψ(x)=a/√(1+x) and Im\u2009ψ(x)=−0.5, so |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 for x in [1,3], and zero elsewhere.; answer: p(x) = { a²/(1+x) + 0.25   for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3; 0 otherwise.\nCoT agent g2dS, on the purpose of deriving probability density, thinking: To get the probability density, compute the modulus squared of the wave function ψ(x). Here ψ(x)=a/√(1+x)−0.5\u2009i. Its modulus squared is (real part)^2+(imag part)^2.; answer: p(x)=|ψ(x)|^2= a^2/(1+x)+0.25 for 1≤x≤3; p(x)=0 otherwise.\nCoT agent a30e, on the purpose of calculating a, thinking: To normalize, set ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1. Compute ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx = ln(4) – ln(2) = ln2. So a²·ln2 + 0.25·2 = 1 ⇒ a²·ln2 = 0.5 ⇒ a = √(0.5/ln2) ≈ 0.85.; answer: a = √(0.5/ln2) ≈ 0.85\nCritic agent ko5x, on the purpose of verifying a, thinking: The normalization integral ∫₁³(|ψ|²dx) = ∫₁³(a²/(1+x)+0.25)dx correctly gives a²·ln2 + 0.5 = 1, so a² = 0.5/ln2 and a = √(0.5/ln2) ≈ 0.85.
