Question: Example(question='We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.1', choice3='0.35', choice4='0.6', correct_index=0)
