We have [ψ]=3/2, [ψ̄]=3/2, [σ_{μν}]=0, [F^{μν}]=2. Summing: 3/2+3/2+0+2=5. Thus [κ]+5=4 → [κ]=−1.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent fsGP:\nThe mass dimension of κ is −1.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine whether the theory is renormalizable by considering the criteria for renormalizability based on the mass dimension of the coupling constant.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent DCvz, on the purpose of determining mass dimensions, thinking: I determine field dimensions by requiring the action to be dimensionless in four dimensions: the Dirac kinetic term fixes [ψ]=3/2, the gauge kinetic term fixes [A]=1 so [F^{μν}]=2, and γ matrices carry no mass dimension.; answer: Mass dimensions in d=4: ψ has 3/2, F^{μν} has 2, γ_μ is dimensionless.\nCoT-SC agent fsGP, on the purpose of calculating \\( \\kappa \\) dimension, thinking: The mass dimension of the interaction term must be 4 in d=4.
