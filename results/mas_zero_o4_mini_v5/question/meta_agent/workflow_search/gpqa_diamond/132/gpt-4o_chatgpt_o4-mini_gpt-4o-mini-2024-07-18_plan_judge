Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 132_Iteration_0
proposed answer: From sub-task 3 values [H2PO4–]=0.0367 M and [HPO4²–]=0.0281 M, use Henderson–Hasselbalch (pH ≈7.094), then Ka3 to get [PO4³–]≈6.24×10⁻⁷ M corresponding to choice 2.
