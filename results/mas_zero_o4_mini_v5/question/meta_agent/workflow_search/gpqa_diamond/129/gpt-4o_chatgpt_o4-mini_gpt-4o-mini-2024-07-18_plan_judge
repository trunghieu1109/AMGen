Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 129_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Based on sub-task 2’s result of z ≳ 1.9 and the provided options (1.9, 2.4, 3, 1.2), the lower-limit choice corresponds to the first option.
