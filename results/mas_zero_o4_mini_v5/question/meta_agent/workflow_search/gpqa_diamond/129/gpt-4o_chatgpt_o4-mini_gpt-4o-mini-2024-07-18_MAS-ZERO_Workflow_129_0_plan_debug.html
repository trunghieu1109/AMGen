    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? &#39;, choice1=&#39;1.9\n\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;2.4&#39;, choice3=&#39;3&#39;, choice4=&#39;1.2\n\n&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the redshift required for the Lyman-alpha wavelength (~1216 Angstrom) to fall within the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent uASc:
We use the relation λ_observed=(1+z)λ_emitted. Taking the blue cutoff of the ground‐based optical window at ≈3500 Å gives z=(3500/1216)−1≈1.88, so a lower limit of ≈1.9.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent uASc:
z ≳ 1.9

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine which of the given choices represents the lower limit for detection by optical telescopes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
