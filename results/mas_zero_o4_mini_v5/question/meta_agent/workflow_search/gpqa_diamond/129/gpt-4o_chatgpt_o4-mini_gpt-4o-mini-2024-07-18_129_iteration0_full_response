This is straightforward and well‐defined, so no [TOO_HARD] needed.; answer: The redshift z of a distant object is defined by z = (λ_observed – λ_emitted) / λ_emitted. Equivalently, λ_observed = (1 + z) · λ_emitted. Thus, if a spectral line has a rest (emitted) wavelength λ_emitted, it will be measured at a longer wavelength λ_observed by a factor of (1 + z) due to cosmic expansion (or Doppler motion). A higher redshift means a larger fractional shift toward longer (redder) wavelengths.\nCoT-SC agent mLWz, on the purpose of calculating redshift, thinking: To bring the 1216\u2009Å Lyman-α line into the optical window of ground-based telescopes (roughly ≥3500\u2009Å), we use z=(λ_obs/λ_em)−1. Taking λ_obs≈3500\u2009Å gives z≈3500/1216−1≈1.88, so the lower limit is about 1.9.; answer: z ≳ 1.9\nCoT-SC agent uASc, on the purpose of calculating redshift, thinking: We use the relation λ_observed=(1+z)λ_emitted. Taking the blue cutoff of the ground‐based optical window at ≈3500\u2009Å gives z=(3500/1216)−1≈1.88, so a lower limit of ≈1.9.; answer: z ≳ 1.9\nCoT-SC agent 5OJa, on the purpose of calculating redshift, thinking: We use λ_observed=(1+z)λ_emitted. For Lyman-α at 1216 Å to appear at the blue end of optical (~3500 Å) requires (1+z)=3500/1216≈2.88 => z≈1.88. Thus lower limit ~1.9.; answer: z≈1.9\nCoT agent r9FU, on the purpose of determining the correct choice, thinking: Based on sub-task 2’s result of z ≳ 1.9 and the provided options (1.9, 2.4, 3, 1.2), the lower-limit choice corresponds to the first option.; answer: A)\nCritic agent JJWW, on the purpose of reviewing the choice, thinking: The chosen lower limit z≈1.9 corresponds to shifting the Lyα line to ~3500Å in the optical range, above the ~3000Å atmospheric cutoff, making it observable from ground-based telescopes. This correctly identifies the smallest viable choice among the options.; answer: True', iteration_idx=0)]
