Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 179_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Based on inclusion of both central–outer and outer–outer repulsions and feedback confirming the known minimum total energy, the system’s minimum energy matches choice A.
