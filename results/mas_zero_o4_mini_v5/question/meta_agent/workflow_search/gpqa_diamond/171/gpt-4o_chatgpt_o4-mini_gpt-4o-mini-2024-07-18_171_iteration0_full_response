Setting this ratio equal to 2 yields ln\u20092 = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2−1/T_1).; answer: The excitation levels relate by N_exc,1/N_exc,2 = exp[ΔE/k_B(1/T_2 − 1/T_1)], i.e. ln\u20092 = (ΔE/k_B)(1/T_2 − 1/T_1).\nCoT-SC agent 5bj2, iteration 0, on deriving equation, thinking: From sub-task 1 we have ln\u20092 = (ΔE/k_B)(1/T_2 − 1/T_1). With ΔE = 1.38×10⁻²³ J and k_B = 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K, the factor ΔE/k_B = 1, so ln\u20092 = 1/T_2 − 1/T_1 = (T_1 − T_2)/(T_1 T_2).; answer: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 * T_2)\nCoT-SC agent JfGX, iteration 1, on deriving equation, thinking: We substitute ΔE/k_B=(1.38×10⁻²³ J)/(1.38×10⁻²³ J/K)=1 into ln2=(ΔE/k_B)(1/T₂−1/T₁), giving ln2=(1/T₂−1/T₁)=(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂).

Plugging ΔE=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J and k_B=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J/K yields ln\u20092=(1/T₂−1/T₁).
