IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic–halogen bond. The simplest structure is an acetophenone (COCH3) with a halogen on the ring: 4-chloroacetophenone.; answer: 4-chloroacetophenone\nCoT-SC agent cc21, on the purpose of analyzing FTIR data, thinking: The IR spectrum of 4-chloroacetophenone should display a strong C=O stretching band and characteristic aromatic C–Cl stretching bands.
