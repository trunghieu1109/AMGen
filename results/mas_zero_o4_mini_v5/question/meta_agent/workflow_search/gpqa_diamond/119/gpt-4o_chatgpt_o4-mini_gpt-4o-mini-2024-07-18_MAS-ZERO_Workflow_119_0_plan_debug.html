Example(question=&#39;Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 1/plx^3&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 1/plx^2&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 1/plx^1&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1/plx^4&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, deduce how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent aich:
Distance d is inversely proportional to parallax (d=1/p). For a uniform spatial distribution, number in a shell ∝ d^2 dd; with dd/dp = -1/p^2, substituting gives N(p)dp ∝ (1/p^2)*(1/p^2)dp = 1/p^4 dp.

### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:
From sub-task 1: d∝1/p. Uniform spatial density ⇒ stars in shell ∝d² dd. Since dd/dp=−1/p² and d=1/p, we get dN/dp ∝(1/p²)*(1/p²)=1/p⁴.

### thinking by Debate Agent YWUl:
Distance d ∝1/p. For uniform spatial density, number of stars in shell of radius d is ∝d^2 dd. With dd/dp=−1/p^2 and d=1/p, we get N(p)dp ∝(1/p^2)*(1/p^2)dp=1/p^4 dp.

### thinking by Debate Agent IA6k:
From sub-task 1: d∝1/p. For uniform spatial density, number in shell ∝d^2dd. With dd/dp=1/p^2, we get N(p)∝(1/p^2)*(1/p^2)=1/p^4.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, deduce how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
