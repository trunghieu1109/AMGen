Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Given a uniform spatial density, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dd at distance d is ∝d^2 dd. With d=1/p and dd=|dd/dp|dp=1/p^2 dp, we get dN/dp∝(1/p^2)*(1/p^2)=1/p^4.

Answer:∝1/plx^4
Extracted answer: ∝1/plx^4
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: Distance d is inversely proportional to parallax p (d=1/p). For a uniform spatial distribution the number of stars in a shell of thickness dd at distance d scales as d^2 dd. Since dd/dp = −1/p^2 and d = 1/p, substituting gives N(p) dp ∝ (1/p^2)*(1/p^2) dp = 1/p^4 dp.
