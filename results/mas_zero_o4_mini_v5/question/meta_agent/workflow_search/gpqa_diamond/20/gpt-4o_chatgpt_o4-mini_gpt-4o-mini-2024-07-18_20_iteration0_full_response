Dimethyl fumarate is a meso or symmetric molecule without chirality.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT agent OqPs, for sub-task 2, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has an sp3-hybridized alpha carbon bonded to four different groups, making it chiral and optically active. Dimethyl fumarate lacks such a stereocenter (it only shows cis–trans isomerism), so it is not optically active.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT agent wHTj, for sub-task 2, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the α-carbon bearing OH, H, CH3, and CO2Me groups, making it chiral. Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral E-alkene without a stereogenic center.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\nDebate agent QNME, for sub-task 3, thinking: Sub-task1: A=benzoquinone.
