Example(question=&#39;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone &amp; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).&#39;, choice1=&#39;A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, choice2=&#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, choice3=&#39;A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, choice4=&#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, identify the correct choice from the given options. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent QNME:
Sub-task1: A=benzoquinone. Sub-task2: B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The option matching A=benzoquinone, B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is choice3, i.e., C).

### thinking by Debate Agent Tp3r:
Sub-task 1 gives A = benzoquinone; Sub-task 2 gives B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate; matches option 3, which is C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
Sub-task 1: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism as enol forms would disrupt aromaticity. Sub-task 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and shows optical isomerism. Matching these to the choices gives A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate corresponding to choice 3, labelled C).

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
From sub-task 1, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. From sub-task 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. The option matching A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is choice 3, i.e. C).

### answer by Debate Agent QNME:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, identify the correct choice from the given options.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
