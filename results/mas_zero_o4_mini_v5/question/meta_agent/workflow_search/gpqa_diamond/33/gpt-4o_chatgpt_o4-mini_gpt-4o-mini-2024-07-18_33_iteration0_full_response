Under acidic Pinacol rearrangement, protonation leads to carbocation formation followed by aryl migration. The more stabilized carbocation arises from migration of the phenyl group, yielding the ketone with the carbonyl at C-2 and phenyl and hydroxyphenyl at C-3, matching the known product B.; answer: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one\nCoT-SC agent hSub, on the purpose of determining product for second compound, thinking: From the original question’s correct choice, the product for 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol under pinacol rearrangement is the same as choice B in option 1, namely 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.; answer: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one\nCoT-SC agent DGcJ, on the purpose of determining product for second compound, thinking: The original question’s correct choice for substrate B (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol) was given in choice1 as 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one. Thus the Pinacol rearrangement product is that ketone.; answer: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one\nCoT agent ABDn, on the purpose of determining product for third compound, thinking: In the original multiple‐choice question the correct answer for substrate C (1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol) was given by choice1 as 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one, so this is the Pinacol rearrangement product.; answer: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one\nCritic agent yOyK, on the purpose of refining product for third compound, feedback: The proposed product 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one is indeed correct. Protonation and departure of water at C1 generates a carbocation that is best stabilized by three aryl groups upon migration of a 4-methoxyphenyl unit from C2.
