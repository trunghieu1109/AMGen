Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 94_Iteration_0
proposed answer: From sub-task 2, the two products identified are 2-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-5-en-4-one and 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one. The latter matches choice 3.
