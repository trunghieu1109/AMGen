Equilibrium expression: K_Ca-EDTA = [CaEDTA2-] / ([Ca2+][EDTA4-])\nCoT agent TOTF, on calcium ion concentration calculation, thinking: We have 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca–EDTA, formation constant K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4-]) = 5×10^10. Let x be [Ca2+] and [EDTA4-]; at equilibrium [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M. Then 5×10^10 = 0.02/(x^2) ⇒ x^2 = 0.02/(5×10^10) = 4×10^-13 ⇒ x ≈ √(4×10^-13) = 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCritic agent 1hOh, on feedback for calcium ion concentration, feedback: The equilibrium calculation is correctly set up: Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]), with [CaEDTA]≈0.02 M and free [EDTA4–]=[Ca2+]=x. Solving 5×10^10 = 0.02/x^2 gives x ≃6.3×10^–7 M.; correct: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCoT agent TOTF, on calcium ion concentration refinement, thinking: We use the equilibrium expression Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]), with initial stoichiometric concentrations giving [CaEDTA]≈0.02 M and free [EDTA4–]=[Ca2+]=x. Solving 5×10^10 = 0.02/x^2 yields x^2 = 0.02/(5×10^10) = 4×10^-13, so x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCritic agent 1hOh, on feedback for calcium ion concentration, feedback: The calculation correctly applies the formation constant expression Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]) with [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M and free [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–] = x. Solving 5×10^10 = 0.02/x^2 gives x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; correct: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCoT agent TOTF, on calcium ion concentration refinement, thinking: We use the formation constant expression Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]) with [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M and free [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–] = x. Thus 5×10^10 = 0.02/x², so x² = 0.02/(5×10^10) = 4×10^-13 and x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCritic agent 1hOh, on feedback for calcium ion concentration, feedback: The original calculation is correct. Using Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) with [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M and setting [Ca2+] = [EDTA] = x gives 5×10^10 = 0.02/x^2. Solving yields x^2 = 4×10^-13 and x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M. An exact quadratic solution (5×10^10 x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0) likewise gives 6.3×10^-7 M, so the refined [Ca2+] is 6.3×10^-7 M.; correct: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCoT agent TOTF, on calcium ion concentration refinement, thinking: Using Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]), with [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M and at equilibrium [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–] = x, we solve 5×10^10 = 0.02/x^2. Thus x^2 = 0.02/(5×10^10) = 4×10^-13 and x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nDebate agent FuR4, round 0, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice3, which corresponds to option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 9Us2, round 0, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: We compare the calculated [Ca2+] = 6.3×10^-7 M to the choices and see that it matches choice C.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 9v6F, round 0, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The calculated concentration 6.3×10^-7 M corresponds exactly to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 79YQ, round 0, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The computed [Ca2+] is 6.3×10^-7 M, which matches choice 3, corresponding to C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent FuR4, round 1, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice3, which corresponds to option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 9Us2, round 1, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The calculated calcium ion concentration is 6.3×10^−7 M, which exactly matches choice 3 corresponding to option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 9v6F, round 1, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice3, which corresponds to option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 79YQ, round 1, on matching concentration to choices, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice 3, which corresponds to option C).; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent, on finalizing choice, thinking: All debate agents concluded option C matches the calculated concentration of 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
