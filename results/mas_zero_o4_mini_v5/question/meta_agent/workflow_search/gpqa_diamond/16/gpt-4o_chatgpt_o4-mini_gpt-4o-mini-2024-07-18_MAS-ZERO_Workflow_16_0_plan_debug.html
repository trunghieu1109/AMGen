    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.&#39;, choice1=&#39;1.0x10^-2 M &#39;, choice2=&#39;5.0x10^-3 M&#39;, choice3=&#39;6.3x10^-7 M&#39;, choice4=&#39;2.0x10^-2 M &#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine which of the provided multiple-choice answers matches the calculated concentration. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice3, which corresponds to option C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
The calculated calcium ion concentration is 6.3×10^−7 M, which exactly matches choice 3 corresponding to option C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9v6F:
The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice3, which corresponds to option C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M matches choice 3, which corresponds to option C).

### answer by Debate Agent FuR4:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent 9Us2:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent 9v6F:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent 79YQ:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, finalize the choice matching the calculated concentration.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
