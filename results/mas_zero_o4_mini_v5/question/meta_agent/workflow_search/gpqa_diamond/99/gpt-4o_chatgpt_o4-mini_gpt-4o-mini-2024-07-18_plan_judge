Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We assign A→H: A=propene; B=1,2-dibromopropane; C=propyne (flammable gas); D=1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) giving two singlets in 1H NMR; E=2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene; F=2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (used in dyes); G=its diazonium chloride; H=2-hydroxy-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (phenolic, gives violet/blue with FeCl₃). Statement 3 is incorrect because H does not give a yellow color with ferric chloride.
