    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star&#39;s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?&#34;, choice1=&#39;~0.07&#39;, choice2=&#39;~0.32&#39;, choice3=&#39;~0.11&#39;, choice4=&#39;~0.39&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, compare the brightness decrease and determine the relative radius of the exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar). 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 5F0d:
From sub-task 1 the brightness drop δ≈0.1035, so R_pl/R_star = √δ ≈ 0.32.

### thinking by Debate Agent inoi:
From sub-task 1 the brightness drop is ΔF≈0.1035, and transit depth δ=(R_pl/R_star)^2=0.1035 ⇒ R_pl/R_star≈√0.1035≈0.32.

### thinking by Debate Agent cIKT:
From sub-task 1 the brightness drop is δ ≈ 0.1035, and for a transit depth δ = (R_pl/R_star)^2, so R_pl/R_star = √0.1035 ≈ 0.32.

### thinking by Debate Agent MCBa:
From sub-task 1 the brightness drop is δ≈0.1035, and δ = (R_pl/R_star)^2, thus R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.32.

### answer by Debate Agent 5F0d:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent inoi:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent cIKT:
0.32

### answer by Debate Agent MCBa:
Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, compare the brightness decrease and determine the relative radius of the exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
