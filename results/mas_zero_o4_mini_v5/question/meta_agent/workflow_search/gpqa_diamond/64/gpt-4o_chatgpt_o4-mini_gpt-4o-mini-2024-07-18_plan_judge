Question: Example(question='By considering different factors like heat, acidic and basic medium, etc., select a suitable mechanism and point out the major products from the following reactions.\n1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A\n(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B', choice1='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice2='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', choice3='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice4='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 64_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Based on sub-task 1, A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one; based on sub-task 2, B is lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate. This corresponds to choice 2, which is option B).
