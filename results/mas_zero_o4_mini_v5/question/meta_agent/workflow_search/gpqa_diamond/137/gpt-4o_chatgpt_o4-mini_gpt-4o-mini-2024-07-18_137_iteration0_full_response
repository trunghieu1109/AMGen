For an acid-catalyzed reaction whose rate is proportional to [H+], lowering [H+] by 10³-fold slows the rate by roughly the same factor.; answer: Increasing the pH from 1 to 4 reduces the proton concentration by 1000-fold, thereby decreasing the rate of an acid-catalyzed reaction by approximately 1000-fold.\nCoT agent N4Od, on the purpose of analyzing temperature impact, thinking: The question asks for how an exothermic reaction affects temperature and subsequently the reaction rate. The assistant identifies that heat release raises temperature, which increases reaction rates per the Arrhenius principle.; answer: The exothermic reaction releases heat, causing the temperature of the reaction mixture to rise. According to the Arrhenius equation, this increase in temperature leads to more frequent and energetic molecular collisions, thereby accelerating the reaction rate.\nDebate agent JTtU, round 0, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: Sub-task 1 shows increasing pH from 1 to 4 lowers [H+] by 1000-fold, drastically slowing an acid-catalyzed reaction. Sub-task 2 shows a temperature rise accelerates the rate via Arrhenius, but this effect is smaller than the 1000-fold slowdown. The net rate decrease is best explained by the pH change.; answer: D)\nDebate agent dcoZ, round 0, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: The exothermic heat raises temperature, accelerating the rate, but the pH rise from 1 to 4 reduces [H+] by 10^3-fold, causing a much larger rate decrease for an acid-catalyzed reaction. Thus the dominant cause of the slowdown is the increased pH.; answer: D)\nDebate agent gT68, round 0, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: Sub-task 1 shows pH rise from 1 to 4 cuts [H⁺] 1000-fold and slows an acid-catalyzed rate by ~1000×. Sub-task 2 shows exotherm raises T, speeding reaction but by a far smaller factor. The net slowdown is dominated by the increased pH.; answer: D)\nDebate agent fpdV, round 0, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: Sub-task 1 shows pH change from 1 to 4 reduces [H+] by 10^3, slowing an acid-catalyzed reaction by ~1000-fold. Sub-task 2 shows exotherm raises temperature, which would speed the reaction. The net observed slowing is therefore due primarily to the pH increase.; answer: D)\nDebate agent JTtU, round 1, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: Sub-task 1 shows raising pH from 1 to 4 cuts [H+] by 10^3, slowing an acid‐catalyzed reaction ~1000×.

The net observed slowdown is therefore due primarily to the increased pH.; answer: D)\nDebate agent dcoZ, round 1, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: The rise in pH from 1 to 4 reduces [H+] by 10^3, causing a ~1000-fold slowdown of the acid-catalyzed reaction, which dominates over the modest rate increase from the exothermic temperature rise.; answer: D)\nDebate agent gT68, round 1, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: The 1000‐fold decrease in [H+] from pH 1 to 4 slows the acid‐catalyzed reaction far more than any temperature rise speeds it. Hence the rate drop is due to increased pH.; answer: D)\nDebate agent fpdV, round 1, on the purpose of determining the reason for rate change, thinking: Sub-task 1 shows increasing pH from 1 to 4 cuts [H+] by 10^3 and slows an acid-catalyzed reaction roughly 1000-fold.
