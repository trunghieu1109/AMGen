    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, choice1=&#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, choice2=&#39;10.&#39;, choice3=&#39;1.&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2, calculate the ratio of the neutrino flux between the energy bands 700-800 KeV and 800-900 KeV. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 8ckR:
Both 700–800 keV and 800–900 keV bins receive only the low‐energy tail of the 8B (pp-III) neutrino spectrum, each contributing at the ~10^-4 level, giving a flux ratio ≃1.

### thinking by Debate Agent tEMz:
Based on sub‐task 1, only the pp‐III (⁸B) tail (and minor CNO) contributes to both 700–800 keV and 800–900 keV bins at roughly the same fractional level (~10⁻⁴ of total). Their integrals over these adjacent 100 keV bins are nearly equal, yielding a ratio ≃1.

### thinking by Debate Agent KtjN:
The 8B neutrino spectrum tail contributes roughly equally to the 700–800 keV and 800–900 keV bands (each about 10⁻⁴ of the total), so their flux ratio is about unity.

### answer by Debate Agent 8ckR:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent tEMz:
The ratio of neutrino flux in the 700–800 keV band to that in the 800–900 keV band is approximately 1.

### answer by Debate Agent KtjN:
Flux ratio ≈ 1.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2, calculate the ratio of the neutrino flux between the energy bands 700-800 KeV and 800-900 KeV.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
