The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151223 u. Subtracting the mass of 3 electrons (3×0.00054858 u) and adding back the small electron binding energy (~2.18×10⁻⁷ u) yields a nuclear mass ≈6.01348 u. Converting 1 u=1.660539×10⁻²⁷ kg gives ≈9.99×10⁻²⁷ kg.; answer: The mass of nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) is approximately 6.01348 u (≈9.99×10⁻²⁷ kg).\nCoT-SC agent FTju, on the purpose of calculating energy, thinking: We compute γ=1/√(1−v²/c²)=1/√(1−0.96²)=≈3.571. With m≈9.99×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg and c²≈9×10¹⁶\u2009m²/s², total energy E=γmc²≈3.571×9.99×10⁻²⁷×9×10¹⁶\u2009J≈3.21×10⁻⁹\u2009J. Converting J to GeV (1\u2009GeV=1.602×10⁻¹⁰\u2009J) gives ≈20.0\u2009GeV.; answer: Total relativistic energy E=γ\u2009m\u2009c²≈3.21×10⁻⁹\u2009J (≈20.0\u2009GeV).\nCoT-SC agent 0Ypb, on the purpose of calculating energy, thinking: We use m≈9.99×10⁻²⁷ kg from sub-task 1, β=0.96 so γ=1/√(1−β²)=1/√(1−0.9216)=1/0.28≈3.571. Then E=γmc²=3.571×9.99×10⁻²⁷ kg×(3.00×10⁸ m/s)²≈3.21×10⁻⁹ J. Converting to GeV via 1 GeV=1.602×10⁻¹⁰ J gives ≈20.0 GeV.; answer: The relativistic energy of nucleus X at 0.96c is E≈3.21×10⁻⁹ J (≈20.0 GeV).\nCoT-SC agent YkWQ, on the purpose of calculating energy, thinking: We use the relativistic energy formula E=γmc² with m≈9.99×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg and β=0.96. γ=1/√(1−β²)=1/√(1−0.9216)≈3.571. Then mc²=(9.99×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg)(9×10¹⁶\u2009m²/s²)=8.991×10⁻¹⁰\u2009J ≈5.61\u2009GeV. Thus E≈γ·5.61\u2009GeV≈3.571·5.61\u2009GeV≈20.05\u2009GeV.; answer: The relativistic energy of nucleus X at 0.96c is approximately 20.05 GeV.\nCoT agent Mrcx, on the purpose of comparing choices, thinking: The computed energy (~20.0 GeV) is closest to choice2 (20.132 GeV) among the given options.; answer: B)\nCritic agent jHjk, on the purpose of verifying choice, feedback: The selection of choice2 (20.132 GeV) is correct based on the calculated energy and required precision.; correct: True', iteration_idx=0)]
