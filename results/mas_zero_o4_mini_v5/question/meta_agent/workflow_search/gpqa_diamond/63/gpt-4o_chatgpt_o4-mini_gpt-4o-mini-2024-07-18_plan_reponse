            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",
