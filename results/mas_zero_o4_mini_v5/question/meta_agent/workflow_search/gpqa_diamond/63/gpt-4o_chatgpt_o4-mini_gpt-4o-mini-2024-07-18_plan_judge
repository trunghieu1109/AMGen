Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 63_Iteration_0
proposed answer: From sub-task 1 we have 0.2 mol H₂O (0.4 mol H and 0.2 mol O), 0.025 mol O₂ (0.05 mol O) and 0.1 mol N₂ (0.2 mol N) from 0.325 mol of salts. Total atoms =0.4+0.25+0.2=0.85 mol atoms → 0.85/0.325≈2.615 atoms per formula unit of the mixture, but since salts A and B are equimolar the sum of their atom counts is 17.
