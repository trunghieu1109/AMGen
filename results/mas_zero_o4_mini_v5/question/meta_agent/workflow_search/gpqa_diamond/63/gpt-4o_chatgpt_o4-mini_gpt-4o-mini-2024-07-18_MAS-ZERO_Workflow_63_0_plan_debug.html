    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, choice1=&#39;15&#39;, choice2=&#39;13&#39;, choice3=&#39;17&#39;, choice4=&#39;19&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the gases formed from the equimolar mixture of salts A and B and their total molecular weight based on the weight increase in tube №1. 

 ### thinking by CoT Agent Hftx:
We can determine moles of gases from mass increases and volume: H2O (3.60 g→0.200 mol), O₂ (0.80 g O→0.025 mol O₂) and the remaining 2.24 L STP→0.100 mol gas C. No CO₂. Gas C is likely N₂. However, “total molecular weight” is ambiguous: it could mean the sum of individual M_r values (18+32+28=78) or the average molar mass of the mixture (7.20 g/0.325 mol≈22.15). Without clarification, we can’t be sure which is required.

### answer by CoT Agent Hftx:
H2O, O₂, and likely N₂; sum of their molar masses = 18 + 32 + 28 = 78
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify whether “total molecular weight” refers to the sum of individual molar masses or the average molar mass of the gas mixture and confirm the identity of gas C.

### Sub-task 2: Determine the composition of the gases that reacted with red-hot copper in tube №3, which led to the formation of CuO. 

 ### thinking #1 by CoT Agent ctnk:
The 0.80 g mass gain in tube 3 corresponds to 0.05 mol O atoms (0.80/16), which comes from consuming 0.025 mol O₂ (each O₂ provides 2 O atoms). No other gases oxidize copper under these conditions. Thus only O₂ reacted with Cu.

### answer #1 by CoT Agent ctnk:
O₂

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, calculate the total number of atoms in the original salts A and B.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From sub-task 1 we have 0.2 mol H₂O (0.4 mol H and 0.2 mol O), 0.025 mol O₂ (0.05 mol O) and 0.1 mol N₂ (0.2 mol N) from 0.325 mol of salts. Total atoms =0.4+0.25+0.2=0.85 mol atoms → 0.85/0.325≈2.615 atoms per formula unit of the mixture, but since salts A and B are equimolar the sum of their atom counts is 17.
