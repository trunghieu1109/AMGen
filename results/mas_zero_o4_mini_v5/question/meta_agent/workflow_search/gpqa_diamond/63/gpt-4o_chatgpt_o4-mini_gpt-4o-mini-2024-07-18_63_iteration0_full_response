Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=2)

No CO₂. Gas C is likely N₂. However, “total molecular weight” is ambiguous: it could mean the sum of individual M_r values (18+32+28=78) or the average molar mass of the mixture (7.20 g/0.325 mol≈22.15). Without clarification, we can’t be sure which is required.\n\n### answer by CoT Agent Hftx:\nH2O, O₂, and likely N₂; sum of their molar masses = 18 + 32 + 28 = 78\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease clarify whether “total molecular weight” refers to the sum of individual molar masses or the average molar mass of the gas mixture and confirm the identity of gas C.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine the composition of the gases that reacted with red-hot copper in tube №3, which led to the formation of CuO. \n\n ### thinking #1 by CoT Agent ctnk:\nThe 0.80 g mass gain in tube 3 corresponds to 0.05 mol O atoms (0.80/16), which comes from consuming 0.025 mol O₂ (each O₂ provides 2 O atoms). No other gases oxidize copper under these conditions.
