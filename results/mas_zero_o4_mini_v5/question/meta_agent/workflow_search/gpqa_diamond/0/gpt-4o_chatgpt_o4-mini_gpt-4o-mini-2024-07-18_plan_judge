Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 0_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Both debate agents concluded D) because only 10^-4 eV exceeds the larger uncertainty (~3.3×10⁻⁷ eV) and thus can clearly resolve the states.

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 3
