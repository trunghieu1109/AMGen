    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?&#39;, choice1=&#39;Superstring Theory&#39;, choice2=&#39;Quantum Electrodynamics&#39;, choice3=&#39;Quantum Chromodynamics&#39;, choice4=&#39;Classical Electrodynamics&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, determine which theory never requires regularization at high energies. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent ms4K:
Among the listed theories, only Superstring Theory is perturbatively UV finite due to the extended nature of strings and thus never requires a separate regularization at high energies.

### thinking by Debate Agent oioE:
Regularization is required in QED, QCD, and classical electrodynamics to handle ultraviolet divergences, whereas in perturbative superstring theory the finite string length smooths high-energy interactions, yielding UV-finite amplitudes without an external regulator.

### thinking by Debate Agent sTqe:
Based on the UV behavior, only Superstring Theory is perturbatively finite due to the extended nature of strings and does not require regularization at high energies.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3P8l:
Among the listed theories, only Superstring Theory is perturbatively UV finite due to the extended nature of strings, so it never requires a high-energy regularization scheme.

Given the above, answer the following question: Final decision based on all debates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
