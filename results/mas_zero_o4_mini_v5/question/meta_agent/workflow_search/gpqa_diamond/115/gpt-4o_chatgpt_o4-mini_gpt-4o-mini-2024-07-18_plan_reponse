            "Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.",
