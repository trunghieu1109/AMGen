The time‐averaged power per unit solid angle is dP/dΩ = (μ0 p̈0^2)/(32π^2 c) sin^2θ. Since p̈0 = −ω^2 p0, this yields (μ0 p0^2 ω^4)/(32π^2 c) sin^2θ. Substituting ω=2πc/λ shows the λ dependence.; answer: dP/dΩ = (μ0 p0^2 ω^4)/(32π^2 c) sin^2θ = (μ0 p0^2 (2πc)^4)/(32π^2 c) λ^{−4} sin^2θ, so f(λ,θ) ∝ λ^{−4} sin^2θ.\nCoT agent 3nQa, on calculating fraction, thinking: The power pattern is f(θ)∝sin^2θ with maximum at sin^2(90°)=1. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4, so the fraction is 1/4.; answer: 1/4\nCritic agent nTtn, feedback: The fraction of maximum power radiated at θ=30° follows the sin²θ pattern, giving sin²(30°)=¼.
