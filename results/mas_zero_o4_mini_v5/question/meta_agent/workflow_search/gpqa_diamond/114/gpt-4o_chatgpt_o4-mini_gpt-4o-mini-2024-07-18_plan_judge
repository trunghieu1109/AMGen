Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Using the total momentum p_total=1091 keV/c and photon energy E_ph=1533 keV, we get cosθ = p_total/(2E_ph) ≃ 0.3558, so θ ≃ 69.2°. The photons are symmetric about the x-axis, giving an opening angle of 2θ ≃ 138.4°, corresponding to choice C.
