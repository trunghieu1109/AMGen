Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Starting from a₁≈0.04 AU (from P₁=3 d and M⋆≈1.5 M⊙) and b=0.2 gives cos i≈0.0349. For planet 2, R⋆=1.5 R⊙≈0.006975 AU and Rp₂=2.5 R⊕≈0.000109 AU, so a₂,max≈(R⋆–Rp₂)/cos i≈0.197 AU. By Kepler’s law P₂=3 d·(0.197/0.04)^{3/2}≈32.7 d≈33.5 d.
