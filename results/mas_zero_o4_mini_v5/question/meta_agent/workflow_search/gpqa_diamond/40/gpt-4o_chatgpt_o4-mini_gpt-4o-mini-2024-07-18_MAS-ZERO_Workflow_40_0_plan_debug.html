    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.&#39;, choice1=&#39;(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;1&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, apply relativistic effects to determine the speed of light as observed in the laboratory frame. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Ghpr:
From sub-task 1, the light speed in the glass rest frame is u&#39; = 1/n. To find the speed in the lab frame where the glass moves at velocity v, apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: u = (u&#39; + v) / (1 + u&#39;v). Substituting u&#39; = 1/n gives u_lab = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n), which simplifies to (1 + n v) / (n + v).

### thinking by Debate Agent zD6d:
In the medium’s rest frame light speed is u&#39;=1/n. To find its speed in the lab frame where the medium moves at speed v along the beam, use the relativistic velocity addition formula: u=(u&#39;+v)/(1+u&#39;v). Substituting u&#39;=1/n yields u_lab=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n), which simplifies to (1+nv)/(n+v).

### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:
In the medium’s rest frame light travels at speed u&#39; = 1/n. To transform to the lab frame where the medium moves at speed v in the same direction, apply the relativistic velocity addition formula u = (u&#39; + v)/(1 + u&#39;v). Substituting u&#39; = 1/n yields u_lab = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v).

### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:
In the rest frame of the glass, light speed is u′=1/n. To transform to the lab frame where the glass moves at velocity v along the beam, use the relativistic velocity‐addition formula u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v). Substituting u′=1/n gives u_lab=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n), which simplifies to (1+n v)/(n+v).

### answer by Debate Agent Ghpr:
u_lab = (1 + n v) / (n + v)

### answer by Debate Agent zD6d:
u_lab = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

### answer by Debate Agent R0wp:
The speed of light in the laboratory frame is u_lab = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

### answer by Debate Agent nsjI:
u_lab = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Final decision based on all debates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
