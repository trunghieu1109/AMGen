To find the speed in the lab frame where the glass moves at velocity v, apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: u = (u\' + v) / (1 + u\'v). Substituting u\' = 1/n gives u_lab = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n), which simplifies to (1 + n v) / (n + v).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zD6d:\nIn the medium’s rest frame light speed is u\'=1/n. To find its speed in the lab frame where the medium moves at speed v along the beam, use the relativistic velocity addition formula: u=(u\'+v)/(1+u\'v). Substituting u\'=1/n yields u_lab=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n), which simplifies to (1+nv)/(n+v).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:\nIn the medium’s rest frame light travels at speed u\' = 1/n. To transform to the lab frame where the medium moves at speed v in the same direction, apply the relativistic velocity addition formula u = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v). Substituting u\' = 1/n yields u_lab = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:\nIn the rest frame of the glass, light speed is u′=1/n.

Setting c=1 gives speed = 1/n.; answer: The speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is 1/n.\nCoT agent V91D, on the purpose of incorporating medium velocity, thinking: To find the light speed in lab frame, use relativistic velocity addition. In medium’s rest frame light travels at u'=1/n. The medium moves at v in the same direction, so u_lab=(u'+v)/(1+u'v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+nv)/(n+v).; answer: The speed of light in the moving glass relative to the laboratory is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which can be written as (1 + n v)/(n + v).\nCritic agent sBvp, on the purpose of feedback on velocity effects, thinking: The motion of the glass “drags” the light forward, so in the lab frame its speed is given by relativistic addition: u_lab=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v). As v increases (in the same direction as the beam), u_lab grows above the static value 1/n and approaches the vacuum limit c=1.; answer: The medium’s velocity increases the observed light speed via u_lab=(1+nv)/(n+v), which exceeds 1/n and tends toward 1 for large v.\nCoT agent V91D, on the purpose of refining velocity effects, thinking: In the medium’s rest frame light speed is u' = 1/n. The medium moves at v, so in the lab frame u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v) = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v).; answer: (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v)\nCritic agent sBvp, on the purpose of feedback on velocity effects, thinking: The medium’s motion “drags” the light, so its speed in the lab frame is higher than 1/n when the glass moves in the same direction as the beam. Relativistic velocity addition gives u=(1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v). As v→1, u approaches 1 but never exceeds c.; answer: (1 + n v)/(n + v)\nCoT agent V91D, on the purpose of refining velocity effects, thinking: We apply relativistic velocity addition: in the glass rest frame light speed is u'=1/n; transforming to the lab frame with medium velocity v gives u=(u'+v)/(1+u'v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n) which simplifies to (1+n v)/(n+v).; answer: (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v)\nCritic agent sBvp, on the purpose of feedback on velocity effects, thinking: The medium’s velocity v adds to or subtracts from the light’s speed in the glass via relativistic velocity addition. Specifically, u=(1/n + v)/(1 + v/n), so for v in the direction of the beam (v>0) the observed speed u exceeds 1/n and approaches 1 as v→1, while for v opposite the beam speed is further reduced.; answer: u=(1/n + v)/(1 + v/n)\nCoT agent V91D, on the purpose of refining velocity effects, thinking: In the glass rest frame light speed is u'=1/n. Transforming to the lab frame where the glass moves at speed v along the beam uses relativistic velocity addition: u=(u'+v)/(1+u'v). Substituting u'=1/n gives u=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n) which simplifies to (1+n v)/(n+v).; answer: u_lab = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v).
