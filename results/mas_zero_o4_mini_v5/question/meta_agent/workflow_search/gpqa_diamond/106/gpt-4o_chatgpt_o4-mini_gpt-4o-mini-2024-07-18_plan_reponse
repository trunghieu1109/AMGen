            "Imagine a situation where a novel natural molecule, Xantheraquin, is discovered and is being investigated for in silico testing against a bacterial pathogen that is multidrug resistant. Preliminary studies indicate that Xantheraquin has multiple chiral centers and can exist in various tautomeric forms. Which of the following steps would be the MOST crucial before proceeding with in silico docking studies, given the complexities of bioinformatics in structure-based drug discovery, ?",
            "Use the most stable chiral form of Xantheraquin, relying on quantum mechanical calculations to predict its interaction with the bacterial target.",
            "Combine in silico predictions with preliminary in vitro binding affinity assays to validate the most promising forms of Xantheraquin before extensive docking studies.",
            "Analyze all tautomeric and chiral forms, but prioritize those forms that are most likely to be biologically active based on physicochemical properties.",
            "Focus on Xantheraquin's pharmacokinetics and ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) properties, using molecular dynamics simulations to predict its behavior in a biological system.",
