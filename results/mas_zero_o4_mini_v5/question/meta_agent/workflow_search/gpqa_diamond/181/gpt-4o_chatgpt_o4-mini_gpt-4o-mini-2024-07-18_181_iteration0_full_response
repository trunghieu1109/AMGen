No additional info request is needed.; answer: The Mott–Gurney (Child’s law) equation assumes:\n1. Single‐carrier transport (only electrons or only holes) with no contribution from the opposite carrier.\n2. Trap‐free material (no deep traps that capture carriers and alter the space‐charge profile).\n3. Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) so that carrier injection at the electrodes is not limiting.\n4. Steady‐state space‐charge‐limited current (SCLC) regime where injected charge dominates over any thermally generated carriers.\n5. Negligible diffusion current (drift dominates transport).\n6. Constant mobility (μ does not depend on electric field or carrier density).\n7. Uniform dielectric constant (ε) and a one‐dimensional field across the sample of thickness L.\nUnder these conditions, J\u2009=\u2009(9/8)\u2009ε\u2009μ\u2009V²\u2009/\u2009L³ accurately describes the current–voltage behavior.\nCoT-SC agent Jth7, analyzing statements, thinking: The Mott-Gurney equation requires a trap-free single-carrier device, Ohmic contacts, negligible diffusion, and drift-dominated SCLC. Statement A matches exactly. B incorrectly replaces injection barrier with negligible drift. C is wrong because it’s for single-carrier only. D is wrong because Schottky contacts introduce barriers.; answer: A) True\nB) False\nC) False\nD) False\nCoT-SC agent 4QB3, analyzing statements, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation requires: single‐carrier transport, trap‐free material, Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier), drift‐dominated (negligible diffusion), constant mobility, and uniform dielectric. Statement A matches all these. B wrongly says negligible drift (but drift must dominate). C uses two carriers (violates single‐carrier). D has a Schottky contact (injection barrier), so invalid.; answer: A: Valid – meets all SCLC assumptions.  B: Invalid – contradicts drift‐dominated transport (it says negligible drift).  C: Invalid – violates single‐carrier assumption (two carriers).  D: Invalid – Schottky contact introduces an injection barrier, violating Ohmic contact requirement.\nCoT-SC agent CN5l, analyzing statements, thinking: Applying the assumptions from Sub-task 1: Choice1 matches all required conditions (trap-free, single-carrier, ohmic contact/no injection barrier, negligible diffusion).
