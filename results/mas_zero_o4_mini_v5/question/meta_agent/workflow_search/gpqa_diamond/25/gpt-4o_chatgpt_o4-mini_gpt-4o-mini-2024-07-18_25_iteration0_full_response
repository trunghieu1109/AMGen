Diiodoethen-1-one (a ketene) is known to do such [2+2] additions, giving the correct product structure. Thus A = 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.\nStep 2: Rank the dienes by their Diels–Alder reactivity: cyclopenta-1,3-diene (most reactive, locked s-cis) > 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (next, s-cis favored but steric hindrance) > (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene (can adopt s-cis but less favorable) > (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (least, locked s-trans-like).

The diiodoketene is 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one. Thus A = 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.\n\nNext, rank the dienes by Diels–Alder reactivity (most to least): cyclopenta-1,3-diene (highest due to ring strain), then 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (electron rich), then (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene, and least is (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (sterically hindered s-cis conformation).
