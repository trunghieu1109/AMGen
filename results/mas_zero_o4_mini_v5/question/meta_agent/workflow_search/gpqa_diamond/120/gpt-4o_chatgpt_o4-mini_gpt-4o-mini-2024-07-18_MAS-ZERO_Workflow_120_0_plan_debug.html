    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:&#39;, choice1=&#39;(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol&#39;, choice2=&#39;(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, choice3=&#39;(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, choice4=&#39;(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-tasks 1 and 2, identify the correct product from the given choices by analyzing the stereochemistry and structure. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 7LZl:
Organocuprate Me2CuLi performs SN2 attack at the less hindered epoxide carbon, inverting its configuration. Mapping this outcome onto the given cyclohexanol structures matches choice 2, i.e. (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

### thinking by Debate Agent CbvA:
Organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via SN2 inversion, leading to (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to choice 2 (B).

### thinking by Debate Agent kSkj:
The organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, causing inversion at that center and yielding (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

### thinking by Debate Agent U451:
The organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via a backside SN2 mechanism, causing inversion of configuration at that center and yielding (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to choice 2.
