They did not ask for multiple-choice output, so a full descriptive answer is required. This is straightforward organic chemistry without missing data, so no [TOO_HARD].; answer: Organocuprates (R2CuLi) open epoxide rings by a concerted SN2‐type attack. The cuprate’s soft nucleophilic alkyl group coordinates to the epoxide oxygen, polarizing the C–O bonds. Attack then occurs at the less hindered carbon—steric factors favor backside approach at the smaller substituent. The attack inverts configuration at that carbon. This gives a copper‐alkoxide intermediate, which upon aqueous workup is protonated to yield the alcohol with the new R group installed at the less hindered site and inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\nCoT agent D3ZD, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome, thinking: We need to state that organocuprate opening of epoxides proceeds by SN2 attack at the less hindered carbon, leading to inversion of configuration at that carbon.; answer: The nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon via a backside SN2‐type mechanism, inverting its configuration (R → S or S → R).\nCritic agent SiUy, on the purpose of providing feedback, feedback: The answer accurately describes that the organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via a backside SN2 mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration at that center.; correct: Yes\nCoT agent D3ZD, on the purpose of refining stereochemical outcome, thinking: The user asks for the stereochemical outcome based on sub-task 1.
