Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 116_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Optical isomerism requires chirality. Compound 1 (hindered biphenyl) is axially chiral; compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has an spÂ³ stereocenter. Compounds 3 and 4 lack chirality.

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 116_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (an sp3 carbon bearing four different substituents). Among the listed compounds, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has such a chiral center. No other compounds meet this criterion.
