This is a direct explanatory task, not a multiple-choice question, and sufficient context is provided.; answer: Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism in which two compounds (enantiomers) have identical connectivity but are non-superimposable mirror images and rotate plane-polarized light in equal but opposite directions. Chirality refers to the property of a molecule that makes it non-identical to its mirror image, typically due to the presence of one or more stereocenters (atoms bonded to four different substituents). Stereoisomers are isomers with the same molecular formula and bonding order but different three-dimensional spatial arrangements; they include enantiomers (optical isomers) and diastereomers.\nCoT agent OnZo, on the purpose of analyzing chiral centers, thinking: Optical isomerism arises from chirality—usually a carbon bearing four different substituents. We check each structure for such a stereocenter.; answer: 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: no tetrahedral stereocenter (any chirality would be atropisomerism, not a classic chiral carbon).\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: yes—central (α) carbon bonded to H, OH, CH₃ and CO₂Me.\n3. Benzophenone: no sp³ carbon with four different substituents (carbonyl C is sp²).\n4. Dimethyl fumarate: no sp³ stereocenter (C=C gives E/Z, not a chiral center).\nCritic agent GPoM, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies that only compound 2 has a stereogenic (chiral) center. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 lack an sp3 carbon bearing four different substituents and therefore cannot exhibit classical optical isomerism.; answer: Only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism.\nCoT agent OnZo, on the purpose of analyzing chiral centers, thinking: Optical isomerism requires an sp3 carbon with four different substituents. Checking each: 1 lacks sp3 stereocenter, 2 has an α-carbon bonded to H, OH, CH3, CO2Me, 3 has sp2 carbonyl, 4 has sp2 alkene carbons. Thus only 2 is chiral.; answer: Only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center.\nCritic agent GPoM, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies sp3 stereocenters and rightly concludes that only compound 2 has a chiral center. While compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism via axial chirality, that falls outside the specific ‘chiral center’ criterion.; answer: Yes\nCoT agent OnZo, on the purpose of analyzing chiral centers, thinking: Optical isomerism requires an sp³ carbon bonded to four different substituents (a stereocenter). Checking each compound: 1) has no sp³ carbon with four distinct groups; 2) its α-carbon is bonded to H, OH, CH₃, and CO₂Me, so it is chiral; 3) the carbonyl C is sp², so no chiral center; 4) the alkene carbons are sp², so no chiral center.; answer: 1: no; 2: yes; 3: no; 4: no\nCritic agent GPoM, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies the presence or absence of chiral centers: compound 2 has a stereocenter, while compounds 1, 3, and 4 do not.; answer: 1: no; 2: yes; 3: no; 4: no\nCoT agent OnZo, on the purpose of analyzing chiral centers, thinking: Optical isomerism requires an sp3 carbon bonded to four different substituents.
