Example(question=&#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, choice1=&#39;2 and 3&#39;, choice2=&#39;1 and 2&#39;, choice3=&#39;3 and 4&#39;, choice4=&#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent h70z:
Optical isomerism requires a chiral center with four different substituents. From sub-task 2 only compound 2 has such a center, so only it exhibits optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent 13vF:
Optical isomerism arises from a chiral center. From sub-task 2 only compound 2 has such a center, so only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent uR49:
Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires an sp3 carbon bonded to four different substituents. From sub-task 2 only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has such a chiral center.

### thinking by Debate Agent Us29:
Only compound 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism, but no provided choice corresponds to just compound 2.

### answer by Debate Agent h70z:
2

### answer by Debate Agent 13vF:
2

### answer by Debate Agent uR49:
Compound 2

### answer by Debate Agent Us29:
[ERROR]

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, finalize which compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (an sp3 carbon bearing four different substituents). Among the listed compounds, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has such a chiral center. No other compounds meet this criterion.
