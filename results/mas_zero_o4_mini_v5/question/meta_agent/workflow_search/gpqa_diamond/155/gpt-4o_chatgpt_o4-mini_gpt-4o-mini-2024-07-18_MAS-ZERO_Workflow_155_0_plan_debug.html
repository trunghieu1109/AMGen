Example(question=&#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, choice2=&#39;3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, choice3=&#39;2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, choice4=&#39;2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 2, determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Bp40:
The mixture contains two enantiomers from the racemic diol, which resolve into two separate peaks on a chiral column, plus the achiral meso diol gives one additional peak, for a total of three peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent Imci:
Based on sub-task 2, the mixture contains a racemic pair (two enantiomers) resolved into two peaks plus one meso diastereomer giving one peak on a chiral HPLC, for a total of three peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent BPnQ:
The racemic reaction yields two enantiomers, which separate on a chiral column into two peaks, and the meso diol is achiral and appears as a single peak, giving 3 total peaks.

### answer by Debate Agent Bp40:
3

### answer by Debate Agent Imci:
[ERROR]

### answer by Debate Agent BPnQ:
3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 2 and debates, determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
