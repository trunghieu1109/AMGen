We infer its role in intercellular communication from its quorum‐sensing nature in bacteria and its ability to trigger morphological and transcriptional changes in yeast.; answer: The quorum-sensing peptide functions as an intercellular signal that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mimics the mating pheromone. It binds to the pheromone receptor, activates the MAPK signaling cascade, induces G1 cell‐cycle arrest, triggers polarized growth, and leads to shmoo formation along with the associated transcriptional reprogramming.\nCoT-SC agent 86T8, exploring chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, thinking: The user asks for an explanation of ChIP-MS and the types of protein complexes identified. This isn’t a simple multiple-choice, so I’ll provide a detailed overview.; answer: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) workflow: 1) Cross-link proteins to DNA in cells to preserve interactions. 2) Shear chromatin into fragments. 3) Immunoprecipitate using an antibody against a target (e.g., specific histone modification or DNA-binding protein). 4) Reverse cross-links to release proteins. 5) Digest proteins into peptides and analyze by LC-MS/MS. 6) Identify proteins and infer complexes via peptide spectra. Types of protein complexes typically identified in active chromatin: • Nucleosome histone complex (core histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4 and variants) • Histone‐modifying enzymes (e.g., HATs, HDACs, methyltransferases) • Chromatin remodelers (e.g., SWI/SNF, ISWI) • General transcription machinery (pre-initiation complex: RNA Pol II, TFIID, TFIIH, etc.) • Co-activator complexes (Mediator) • Sequence-specific transcription factors and enhancer complexes • Chromatin architectural proteins (e.g., CTCF, cohesin) The pre-replication complex (ORC, Cdc6, Mcm2-7) is usually not enriched unless the IP specifically targets replication origins.\nCoT-SC agent 9qv5, exploring chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, thinking: The sub-task asks which protein complexes are typically identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry when analyzing active chromatin. ChIP-MS captures proteins bound to DNA regions under study, such as promoters and enhancers, so one recovers histones, transcription regulators, co-activators and pre-initiation machinery. Replication complexes are not bound to active transcription sites and thus are least likely to appear.; answer: ChIP-MS of active chromatin will recover nucleosome histone complexes, enhancer protein complexes, pre-initiation complexes (general transcription factors/Pol II), and other co-activator or chromatin remodeler complexes; the least observed will be pre-replication complexes.\nCoT-SC agent SjWm, exploring chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, thinking: The user asks for descriptions of protein complexes identified by ChIP-MS of active chromatin (shmoo). It's an open question, not multiple choice. So I’ll list the main complexes typically recovered (PIC, mediator, elongation factors, nucleosomes, remodelers) and note that pre-replication complexes are absent because they bind inactive origins in G1, not active transcription sites.; answer: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry on active shmoo chromatin typically recovers:\n\n1. Pre‐initiation complex components (e.g., TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH)\n2. Coactivator and enhancer complexes (e.g., Mediator, chromatin remodelers like Swi/Snf)\n3. Transcription elongation factors (e.g., Spt5, FACT)\n4. Nucleosome core histones and histone‐modifying enzymes (e.g., HATs, HDACs)\n\nPre‐replication complex proteins (e.g., ORC, Cdc6, MCMs) are least likely to be detected in this assay, since they bind origins during G1 rather than at active transcription sites.\nDebate agent 4jjA, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active (transcriptionally engaged) regions isolates proteins involved in transcription initiation and regulation and histone variants/modifications. The pre-replication complex assembles at origins during G1 but is not part of active transcription chromatin, so it will be minimally recovered.; answer: Likely observed protein complexes: pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex. Least likely complex: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent uVPd, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Given that shmoo formation involves active transcriptional reprogramming, we expect to capture proteins associated with active chromatin: transcriptional pre-initiation complexes, enhancer-binding protein complexes, and nucleosome histone complexes engaged in gene activation. Because cells are arrested in G1 and not entering S-phase, pre-replication complexes will be minimally bound to chromatin and thus least likely recovered.; answer: Likely observed: pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex. Least likely observed: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent gGgI, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Sub-task 1 shows that the quorum‐sensing peptide induces a pheromone‐like response in yeast, leading to transcriptional activation at mating genes and G1 arrest (shmoo formation). Sub-task 2 indicates that ChIP‐MS on active chromatin captures transcriptional machinery at promoters (pre‐initiation complex), regulatory factor assemblies at enhancers (enhancer protein complex), and the underlying nucleosomes/histones at active loci. The pre‐replication complex is assembled at origins in late M/G1 but is not directly associated with actively transcribed chromatin and thus would be underrepresented in an active‐chromatin ChIP‐MS.; answer: Protein complexes likely observed in the assay: pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex. Least likely complex: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent SMa6, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Active chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry on shmoo-forming yeast will capture transcriptionally engaged chromatin and its associated factors: proteins of the pre-initiation complex (RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors), enhancer-binding complexes, and histones in remodeled nucleosomes. The pre-replication complex assembles at origins of replication during G1 but is not part of active transcriptional chromatin, so it will be underrepresented or absent.; answer: Likely observed: pre-initiation complex; enhancer protein complex; nucleosome histone complex. Least likely observed: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent 4jjA, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Active chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry will enrich for proteins directly bound to transcriptionally engaged DNA regions. These include general transcription machinery at promoters (pre-initiation complex), regulatory factors at enhancers (enhancer protein complex), and core histones in remodeled nucleosomes. In contrast, the pre-replication complex assembles at origins during late M/G1 but is not associated with loci undergoing active transcription in the shmoo state, so it will be underrepresented or absent.; answer: Likely observed: pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex. Least likely: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent uVPd, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Active-chromatin ChIP–MS on shmoo-forming yeast captures transcriptionally engaged factors (pre-initiation complex, enhancer proteins, histones) but not replication-origin complexes, which are not part of active transcription. Hence the pre-replication complex will be least represented.; answer: Likely observed: pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex. Least likely observed: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent gGgI, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: ChIP-MS of active chromatin isolates transcriptional machinery (pre-initiation complex), regulatory factors (enhancer protein complex), and histones (nucleosome histone complex).
