Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 36_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The final product is 1,1,2,2-tetraethylethene. All four ethyl groups are equivalent by symmetry, giving one CH3 and one CH2 signal, plus one signal for the equivalent sp2 carbons, for a total of 3 signals.
