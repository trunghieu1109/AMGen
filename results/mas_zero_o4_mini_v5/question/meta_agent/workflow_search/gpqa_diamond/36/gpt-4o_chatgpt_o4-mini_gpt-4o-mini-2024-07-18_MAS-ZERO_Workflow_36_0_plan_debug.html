    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---&gt; A\nA + BuLi ---&gt; B\nB + Bromoethane ---&gt; C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---&gt; D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---&gt; E&#39;, choice1=&#39;3&#39;, choice2=&#39;11&#39;, choice3=&#39;8&#39;, choice4=&#39;6&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, determine the structure of final product E formed by the reaction of D with PPh3/3-bromopentane/BuLi. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent YBxV:
The ketone D (pentan-3-one) undergoes a Wittig reaction with the phosphonium ylide derived from 3-bromopentane and PPh3/BuLi. The ylide Ph3P= C(Et)2 reacts with the C=O of pentan-3-one to give the tetrasubstituted alkene where both alkene carbons bear two ethyl groups. This is ethene with two ethyl substituents on each carbon: 1,1,2,2-tetraethylethene.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent YBxV:
Final product E is 1,1,2,2-tetraethylethene (ethene with two ethyl groups on each carbon).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Based on the output of sub-task 5, identify the number of distinct 13C-NMR signals for the final product E.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The final product is 1,1,2,2-tetraethylethene. All four ethyl groups are equivalent by symmetry, giving one CH3 and one CH2 signal, plus one signal for the equivalent sp2 carbons, for a total of 3 signals.
