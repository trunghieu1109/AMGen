The maximum energy (endpoint Q) occurs when the other particles carry away minimal kinetic energy, and is fixed by the mass difference between initial and final states.; answer: The spectrum of E is continuous because in a four-body final state the available energy is partitioned continuously among all particles. The endpoint Q is set by the total mass difference between the initial (2A) and final (2B+2V) states (i.e. Q = [2m_A – (2m_B + 2m_V)]c^2).\nCoT agent DVoR, on analyzing variant decay process, thinking: Replacing the two neutrinos by a single massless particle still gives a multi‐body final state (2 electrons + M) whose shared energy can vary continuously; the phase‐space distribution changes but remains continuous. Since M is massless (whereas 2 neutrinos carry away nonzero invariant mass), the maximum electron energy is larger than before.; answer: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nCritic agent 8z1d, feedback: The provided analysis correctly identifies that replacing two neutrinos with a single massless particle still yields a multi-body final state, so the electron energy spectrum remains continuous. It also rightly notes that removing the invariant mass of the neutrino pair raises the maximum energy available to the electrons, hence increasing the endpoint. The reasoning and conclusion are sound.; correct: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nCoT agent DVoR, on refining variant decay process, thinking: Replacing two neutrinos with a single massless particle maintains a multi-body final state, so the electron energy spectrum remains continuous, and because the neutrino pair had nonzero invariant mass whereas M is massless, more energy is available to electrons, raising the endpoint.; answer: C)\nCritic agent 8z1d, feedback: The analysis is sound: replacing two neutrinos (which can have nonzero invariant mass) with a single massless particle still yields a multi-body final state, so the electron spectrum remains continuous, and because the single massless particle enforces zero invariant mass for the undetected part, more energy is available to the electrons, raising the endpoint.; correct: C\nCoT agent DVoR, on refining variant decay process, thinking: Replacing two neutrinos with a single massless particle still yields a multi-body final state, so the electron energy spectrum remains continuous.

Replacing two massive Neutrinos with one massless particle still leaves multiple bodies, so continuity remains, and the lighter undetected particle lets the E’s endpoint increase.; answer: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nDebate agent HRrG, round 0, thinking: The decay retains a multi-body final state (now 3 bodies), so the electron spectrum stays continuous.
