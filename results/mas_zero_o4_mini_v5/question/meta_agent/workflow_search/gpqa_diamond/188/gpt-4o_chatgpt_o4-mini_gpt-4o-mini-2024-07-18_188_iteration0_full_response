This is straightforward physics knowledge, no missing info.; answer: Spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the underlying laws (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) have a symmetry that the ground state does not share. This leads to massless (or light) Nambu–Goldstone bosons. Typical particles/modes associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries include:\n\n• Magnons – spin-wave excitations in magnets (broken spin-rotation symmetry)\n• Phonons – lattice vibrations in crystals (broken continuous translational symmetry)\n• Pions (and kaons, etas) – pseudo–Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry in QCD\n• Superfluid phonons – sound modes in superfluids (broken \n  U(1) particle-number symmetry)\n• Spin waves in antiferromagnets, ferroelectric modes in ferroelectrics, etc.\nReflexion CoT agent zKF6, on the purpose of analyzing particle characteristics, thinking: Magnons, phonons, and pions are Nambu–Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin-rotation, translational, and chiral symmetries, respectively). Skyrmions are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes and are not directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way.; answer: B)\nCritic agent SfQK, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies magnons, phonons, and pions as Nambu–Goldstone bosons from broken continuous symmetries and properly distinguishes skyrmions as topological solitons not tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.; answer: Skyrmion\nReflexion CoT agent zKF6, on the purpose of refining analysis, thinking: Magnons, phonons, and pions are Nambu–Goldstone modes arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin-rotation, translational, and chiral symmetries, respectively).
