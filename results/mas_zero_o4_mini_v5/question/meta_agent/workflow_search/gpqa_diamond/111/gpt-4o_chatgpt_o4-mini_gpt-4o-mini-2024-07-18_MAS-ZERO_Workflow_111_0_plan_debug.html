    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Let |alpha&gt; be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up&gt; + (2-i) |down&gt;, where |up&gt; and |down&gt; are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. &#39;, choice1=&#39;0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)&#39;, choice2=&#39;0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)&#39;, choice3=&#39;0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the normalized state vector |alpha&gt; based on the given state (1+i)|up&gt; + (2-i)|down&gt;. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ToUr:
Compute normalization: norm^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7, so norm = √7. Divide each coefficient by √7.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ToUr:
|α⟩ = [(1 + i)|up⟩ + (2 − i)|down⟩] / √7

### Sub-task 2: Based on the normalized state vector, determine the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operator given its matrix representation. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent L58G:
The operator is A=(ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]]= (ħ/2)σ_x. σ_x has eigenvalues ±1 with eigenvectors (1,±1)/√2, so A has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 and eigenstates (|up&gt;±|down&gt;)/√2.

### answer by Final Decision Agent L58G:
Eigenvalues: +ħ/2 and -ħ/2; Eigenstates: (|up&gt;+|down&gt;)/√2 for +ħ/2, and (|up&gt;-|down&gt;)/√2 for -ħ/2.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the normalized state vector and eigenstates, calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1UAO:
The normalized state is |α⟩=[(1+i)|up⟩+(2−i)|down⟩]/√7. The eigenstates are |±⟩=(|up⟩±|down⟩)/√2. Compute ⟨+|α⟩=(1/√2√7)[(1+i)+(2−i)]=3/√14, so P+=|3/√14|²=9/14≈0.64. Similarly ⟨−|α⟩=(1/√14)[(1+i)−(2−i)]=(−1+2i)/√14, so P−=5/14≈0.36.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1UAO:
P(+ħ/2)=9/14≈0.64; P(−ħ/2)=5/14≈0.36

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the probabilities and eigenvalues, calculate the average value of the operator.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
