Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 84_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 depends on the semi‐major axes via T_eq ∝ T_star·√(R_star/(2a)), so T_eq1/T_eq2 = √(a2/a1). Sub-task 2 did not provide the orbital distances or periods (a1, a2), so a numeric value cannot be determined.

Answer:T_eq1/T_eq2 = √(a2/a1)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the semi-major axes or orbital periods for Planet1 and Planet2 to compute their equilibrium temperature ratio.
Extracted answer: T_eq1/T_eq2 = √(a2/a1)
Correct answer: 2
