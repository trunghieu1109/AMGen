Without those periods we must estimate using the available Doppler amplitudes and assume circular orbits, giving Teq1/Teq2≈(a2/a1)1/2≈0.536.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent CjuO:\nUsing the relation K∝Mp/P^{1/3} and Kepler’s third law for circular orbits gives P2/P1≈0.154, hence a2/a1≈0.287. Since Teq∝a^{-1/2}, the ratio Teq1/Teq2≈(a2/a1)^{1/2}≈0.536≈0.53.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent DIHY:\nSub-task 2 is missing the orbital periods, so we cannot compute the semi-major axes and hence the equilibrium temperatures precisely. Without P1 and P2, any ratio is uncertain. Based on the Kepler 3rd law and K∝M/P^1/3, one might infer ~0.53, but this requires assumed periods. Therefore a request for P1 and P2 is needed.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vYeA:\nExact equilibrium temperatures require knowing orbital periods to determine semi-major axes, which are not provided.

For circular orbits, K∝M_p/P^(1/3) so P2/P1=(M2K1/M1K2)^3≈(5·0.03/(7·0.04))^3≈0.154. Then a∝P^(2/3) gives a2/a1≈0.287.
