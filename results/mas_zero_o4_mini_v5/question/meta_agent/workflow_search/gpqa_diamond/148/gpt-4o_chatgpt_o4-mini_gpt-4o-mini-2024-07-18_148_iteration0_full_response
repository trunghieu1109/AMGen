The question doesn’t request a multiple‐choice letter, so I need to give a full explanation.; answer: The two equal‐integral peaks for the same α-proton indicate two distinct species in solution rather than spin-spin splitting. Their nearly identical chemical shifts show that each species has a very similar local environment. Since coupling patterns rule out J-splitting, the most likely cause is that you have two isomeric forms (for example, amide rotamers or epimerized diastereomers) that interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale. Each isomer places the α-proton in a slightly different electronic environment, giving two separate signals of equal intensity.\nCoT agent 31vd, on analyzing LC-MS data, thinking: The LC-MS data show two chromatographic peaks of equal intensity yet identical mass spectra, indicating two distinct species with the same molecular formula. Since they don’t interconvert rapidly even at elevated temperature, they are not merely rotamers but true stereoisomers. Combined with the NMR evidence for two equally populated forms of the α-proton, the most consistent explanation is that epimerization occurred during synthesis, giving two diastereomers (e.g., a mixture of L- and D- at the α-carbon) that are separable by LC but share the same mass.; answer: The two equal-intensity LC-MS peaks with identical mass spectra indicate the presence of two stereoisomeric forms—most likely diastereomers resulting from epimerization at the α-carbon during synthesis.\nCritic agent ENBe, on reviewing LC-MS data, thinking: The LC-MS analysis correctly identifies two equally intense peaks with identical mass spectra, which strongly supports the presence of diastereomers arising from α‐carbon epimerization during synthesis.; answer: The interpretation is correct.\nCoT agent 31vd, on refining LC-MS data, thinking: The persistence of two LC-MS peaks with identical mass spectra even at elevated temperature confirms that the species are not merely conformers or rotamers but are true stereoisomers that do not interconvert rapidly. This matches the NMR observation of two equal‐intensity α‐proton signals arising from two distinct diastereomeric environments. The equal populations and separable retention times are characteristic of diastereomers formed by epimerization at the α‐carbon during peptide coupling.; answer: The two equal‐intensity LC-MS peaks with identical m/z values, which remain distinct at elevated temperature, corroborate that the sample is a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers resulting from epimerization at the α-carbon; these diastereomers have slightly different chromatographic properties but the same molecular weight.\nCritic agent ENBe, on reviewing LC-MS data, thinking: The LC-MS data strongly support the presence of two diastereomers: the two peaks of equal intensity and identical mass spectra that remain separate even at elevated temperature are exactly what you’d expect if epimerization at the α-carbon produced a 1:1 mixture of diastereomeric peptides with slightly different chromatographic behavior.; answer: The LC-MS results corroborate the diastereomer mixture explanation resulting from epimerization at the α-carbon.\nCoT agent 31vd, on refining LC-MS data, thinking: The persistence of two LC-MS peaks with identical mass spectra even at elevated temperature indicates these are not rapidly interconverting conformers or rotamers but discrete stereoisomers. This perfectly matches the NMR observation of two equal-intensity α-proton signals. The only stereoisomeric pair consistent with unchanged molecular weight and slow interconversion is a pair of diastereomers arising from α-carbon epimerization during peptide coupling.; answer: The LC-MS data confirm a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers resulting from α-carbon epimerization; they remain distinct at high temperature and share identical mass spectra.\nCritic agent ENBe, on reviewing LC-MS data, thinking: Your LC-MS analysis is sound. Observing two peaks with identical mass spectra at elevated temperature rules out rapidly interchanging conformers or rotamers and indicates two distinct stereoisomers. Their equal intensities mirror the duplicate α-proton signals in the NMR, consistent with a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers formed by α-carbon epimerization during peptide coupling.; answer: The compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\nCoT agent 31vd, on refining LC-MS data, thinking: The LC-MS data showing two distinct peaks of equal intensity with identical mass spectra that persist even at elevated temperature cannot be explained by conformational rotamers (which would coalesce at higher temperature) nor by contamination. Together with the NMR evidence of two α-proton signals of equal intensity, the only plausible explanation is a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers arising from epimerization at the α-carbon during peptide coupling. This refined understanding aligns both sets of data into a single coherent model.; answer: The LC-MS data confirm that the sample is a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers resulting from α-carbon epimerization: the two chromatographic peaks have identical mass spectra and remain distinct even at elevated temperature, consistent with two separable stereoisomers rather than rapidly interconverting conformers.\nDebate agent Qp9t, round 0, on integrating findings, thinking: The two equal‐integral NMR signals and two distinct, equal‐intensity LC‐MS peaks with identical mass spectra that do not coalesce at elevated temperature are best explained by a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers arising from α‐carbon epimerization during peptide coupling.; answer: B)\nDebate agent MgfX, round 0, on integrating findings, thinking: Integration of the NMR data showing two separate α-proton signals of equal intensity (ruling out coupling) with the LC-MS data showing two distinct peaks of identical mass (persistent at elevated temperature) points to two stable stereoisomers rather than rotamers or contamination.
