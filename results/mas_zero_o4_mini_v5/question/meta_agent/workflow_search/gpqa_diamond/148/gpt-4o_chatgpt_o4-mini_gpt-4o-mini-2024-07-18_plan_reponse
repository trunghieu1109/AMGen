            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The NMR shows two equal-integral \u03b1-proton peaks with no coupling, and LC-MS shows two peaks of identical mass persisting at elevated temperature, consistent with two stable stereoisomers. This matches formation of a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers via \u03b1-carbon epimerization during amide coupling.\n\nAnswer:B)",
