Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 58_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Using the computed [OH⁻] of 0.0417 M gives pOH ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 − 1.38 = 12.62, which corresponds to choice B).
