Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 68_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The computed minimum decay length L_min ≈1.9×10⁻⁶ m matches closest to the provided option 2.08×10⁻⁶ m, which corresponds to choice C).
