Example(question=&#39;In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.&#39;, choice1=&#39;2.08*1e-1 m&#39;, choice2=&#39;2.08*1e-9 m&#39;, choice3=&#39;2.08*1e-6 m&#39;, choice4=&#39;2.08*1e-3 m&#39;, correct_index=2).
