    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, choice1=&#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, choice3=&#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the expectation value of P_z using the given state vector and the matrix form of P_z. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent nhzI:
We have state components c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2. P_z is diagonal (ℏ, 0, -ℏ). Expectation ⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|²ℏ + |c2|²·0 + |c3|²(−ℏ) = (1/4)ℏ + 0 + (1/4)(−ℏ) = 0.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent nhzI:
The expectation value of P_z is 0.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the expectation value of P_z^2. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent mMmx:
We use the state components c1=−1/2, c2=1/√2, c3=−1/2 and P_z^2 eigenvalues ℏ^2, 0, ℏ^2. So ⟨P_z^2⟩=|c1|^2ℏ^2+|c2|^2·0+|c3|^2ℏ^2=(1/4+1/4)ℏ^2=ℏ^2/2.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent mMmx:
The expectation value of P_z^2 is ℏ^2/2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, calculate the uncertainty ΔP_z using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
