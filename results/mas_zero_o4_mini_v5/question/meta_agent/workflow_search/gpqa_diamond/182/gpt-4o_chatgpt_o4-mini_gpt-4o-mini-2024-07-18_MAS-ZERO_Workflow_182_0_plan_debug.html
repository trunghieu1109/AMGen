    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?&#39;, choice1=&#39;1&#39;, choice2=&#39;3&#39;, choice3=&#39;0&#39;, choice4=&#39;5&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine the reaction mechanism and identify the product formed when the compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent jUU7:
Red phosphorus and HI effect a reductive deoxygenation (similar to HI/P reductions): carboxylic acid and aldehyde are converted to alkyl iodides which are then reduced by HI to methyl groups, while the vinyl and ring alkene remain intact.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent jUU7:
The reaction proceeds via reductive deoxygenation of –COOH and –CHO to –CH₃. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
