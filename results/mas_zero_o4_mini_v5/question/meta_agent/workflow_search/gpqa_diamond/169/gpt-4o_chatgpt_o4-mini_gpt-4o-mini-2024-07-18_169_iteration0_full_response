Compute σ_yψ: [0  −i; i  0]·(3i,4)=(-4i,−3). Then ⟨σ_y⟩=ψ†σ_yψ=(1/25)[(−3i,4)·(−4i,−3)]=(1/25)(−12−12)=−24/25. Hence ⟨S_y⟩=(ħ/2)⟨σ_y⟩=−12ħ/25.; answer: -12*hbar/25\nCoT-SC agent BSHO, on the purpose of performing calculations, thinking: First normalize the spin state ψ=(3i,4) so its norm is 5, giving ψ_norm=(3i/5,4/5).
