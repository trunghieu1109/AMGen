            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "The IR confirms an ester. The 1H NMR shows a para\u2010disubstituted benzene (4\u2009H), two vinyl H (trans coupling J\u224816\u2009Hz), one of which couples to a methyl (J\u22481.5\u2009Hz), plus a singlet for OCH3 and a doublet for a vinyl CH3. This fits methyl (E)-4-propenylbenzoate (Ar-CH=CH-CH3 at para to CO2Me), formula C11H12O2.\n\nAnswer:The compound is methyl (E)-4-propenylbenzoate (methyl trans-p-propenylbenzoate), C11H12O2.",
