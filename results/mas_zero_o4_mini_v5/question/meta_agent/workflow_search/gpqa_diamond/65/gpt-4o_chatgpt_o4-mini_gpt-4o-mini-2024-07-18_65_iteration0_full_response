In any relativistic EFT, including SMEFT, operators must be Lorentz invariant to ensure consistency, causality, and a well‐defined particle interpretation.; answer: Lorentz symmetry is the requirement that operators be invariant under spacetime rotations and boosts. In the SMEFT, every operator must respect Lorentz symmetry, so yes, it must be respected by all operators.\nCoT agent IfFQ, on the purpose of analyzing Poincare symmetry, thinking: The question asks for an analysis of Poincare symmetry in SMEFT and whether all operators must respect it. This is straightforward: SMEFT is a local QFT respecting Poincare invariance, so all operators must be Poincare invariant. No missing info or excessive complexity, so no [TOO_HARD] needed.; answer: In SMEFT, Poincare symmetry (the combined group of space–time translations and Lorentz transformations) ensures invariance under shifts in space–time and rotations/boosts, which leads to conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. All effective operators in SMEFT must be constructed as Poincare-invariant (i.e., Lorentz-scalar) combinations of fields and their derivatives. Therefore, every operator in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.\nCoT agent 3HGn, on the purpose of analyzing CP symmetry, thinking: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation and parity, and while it is an approximate symmetry of the SM, the SM already contains CP-violating interactions (in the CKM matrix). The SMEFT framework is constructed to include all gauge- and Lorentz-invariant operators up to a given dimension, regardless of their CP properties. Thus CP invariance is not imposed as a fundamental requirement on the operator basis; CP-violating operators are allowed and included to capture possible new sources of CP violation.; answer: CP symmetry is not required to be respected by all SMEFT operators. Operators violating CP are included in the full SMEFT basis to account for both SM and potential beyond-SM sources of CP violation.\nCoT agent Merq, on the purpose of analyzing CPT symmetry, thinking: The user requests an analysis of CPT symmetry within SMEFT and whether all operators must respect it. This is not a multiple-choice question, so we provide a full answer without selecting a letter.; answer: CPT symmetry is guaranteed by the CPT theorem, which holds in any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. SMEFT is built on precisely these assumptions—it extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators while preserving locality, Lorentz symmetry, and unitarity. As a result, every operator in the SMEFT must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Violating CPT would require abandoning one of the core QFT principles (e.g., locality or Lorentz invariance), which lies outside the SMEFT framework. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected by all SMEFT operators.\nDebate agent Gjag, round 0, on the purpose of determining the correct combination of symmetries, thinking: Sub-tasks conclude that all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincaré (2) invariance, while CP violation is allowed (3) and CPT follows from the QFT axioms rather than being an independent imposed symmetry.
