Example(question=&#39;Identify compound E in the following reaction scheme.\nCompound A, when reacted with HCN, produces compound B.\nCompound B, upon reduction with H2 in the presence of Pd, forms compound C.\nCompound C, upon reaction with HNO2, forms compound D.\nCompound D, upon elimination of an inert gas, forms compound E.\nHints:\na) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\nb) The IR spectrum of compound A exhibits a strong peak at around 1750 cm^-1 whereas, IR spectrum of compound E exhibits strong peak at around 1715 cm^-1.&#39;, choice1=&#39;4-methylcycloheptan-1-one&#39;, choice2=&#39;2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one&#39;, choice3=&#39;2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one&#39;, choice4=&#39;3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, identify compound E by analyzing the elimination of an inert gas from compound D and the IR spectrum data. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent x6GO:
Elimination of N₂ from the α-hydroxy diazonium intermediate yields a cyclobutanone whose IR C=O stretch at 1715 cm⁻¹ matches a small four-membered ketone with four methyl substituents, corresponding to 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one.

### thinking by Debate Agent R5zW:
Upon loss of N₂ from the α-hydroxy diazonium intermediate, a carbocation rearrangement yields a strained cyclobutanone. The IR C=O stretch at 1715 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a four-membered ketone. Thus compound E matches 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one.

### thinking by Debate Agent BvTM:
Compound D loses N₂ to generate a carbocation that rearranges into a four-membered ketone; the IR C=O stretch at 1715 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a cyclobutanone, matching 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one.

### thinking by Debate Agent tKg4:
Loss of N₂ from the α-hydroxy diazonium yields a carbocation that rearranges to the strained four-membered ketone. The observed IR C=O stretch at 1715 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a cyclobutanone. Among the choices, only 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one matches, corresponding to choice C.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, identify compound E by analyzing the elimination of an inert gas from compound D and the IR spectrum data.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
