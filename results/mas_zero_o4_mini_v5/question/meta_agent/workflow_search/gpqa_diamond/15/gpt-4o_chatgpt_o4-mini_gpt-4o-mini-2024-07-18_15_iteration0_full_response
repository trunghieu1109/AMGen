If correct, output \'True\'. \n\n ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent 6cLs:\nThe conclusion of four optically active compounds is incorrect. Compound 6, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, is meso due to an internal mirror plane, so it is achiral.

Compound 6, the all-syn cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, has D3d symmetry (an S6 axis and mirror planes) and is achiral. Thus only compounds 2, 4, and 5 are optically active, giving a total of three.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, reflect on previous attempts and refine the count of optically active compounds.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent DQVo, on the purpose of determining criteria for optical activity, thinking: The user asks for criteria for optical activity. This is straightforward chemical knowledge about chirality and stereochemistry, so no additional data or decomposition is needed.; answer: Optical activity arises when a molecule is chiral, i.e. it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key criteria:\n1. Presence of at least one stereogenic element (commonly a tetrahedral carbon with four different substituents).\n2. Absence of an internal plane of symmetry or inversion center (meso compounds are achiral despite stereocenters).\n3. Other forms of chirality also confer optical activity, such as axial chirality (e.g. allenes, biphenyls), helical chirality, and planar chirality.\n4.
