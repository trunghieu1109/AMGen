proposed answer: Reviewing the stereochemical analyses and symmetry elements: 
1: achiral; 2: has two stereocenters without an internal mirror plane so chiral; 3: meso (achiral); 4: R,R succinic acid (chiral); 5: R‚Äêcyclohex-3-en-1-ol (chiral); 6: the all-syn cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is meso due to D3d symmetry (achiral); 7: achiral. Thus only compounds 2, 4, and 5 are optically active, giving a total of three.
