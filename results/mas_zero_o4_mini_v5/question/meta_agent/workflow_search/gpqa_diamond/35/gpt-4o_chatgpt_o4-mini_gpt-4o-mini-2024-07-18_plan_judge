Question: Example(question='Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?', choice1='Cold molecular interstellar medium.', choice2='Cold atomic interstellar medium.', choice3='Warm atomic interstellar medium.', choice4='Warm molecular interstellar medium.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 35_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The 3.9 ÂµeV line is the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, which is observed in absorption by the cold atomic neutral medium (cold neutral medium) in the Milky Way.
