    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star&#39;s surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.&#34;, choice1=&#39;~2.9&#39;, choice2=&#39;~4.5&#39;, choice3=&#39;~7.8&#39;, choice4=&#39;~1.1&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 when the star has a Teff of 6000K. Use the wavelength of 1448 Å. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent faZf:
We use the Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations n2/n1 ≃ (g2/g1) exp(−ΔE/kT). Assuming g2≈g1 and ΔE=hc/λ with λ=1448 Å, we get ΔE/kT≈16.6 at T=6000 K, so n2/n1≈exp(−16.6)≈6.3×10⁻⁸.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent faZf:
n2/n1 ≃ 6.3×10⁻⁸

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of Sub-task 1, calculate the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 when the star has a Teff of 5500K. Use the wavelength of 1448 Å. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7wYa:
We use the Boltzmann factor n2/n1 ≃ exp(−ΔE/kT) with ΔE/k=ΔE/ (1.38×10−23 J/K) converted via 1448 Å. From sub-task 1, ΔE/kT at 6000 K was 16.6, so ΔE/k=16.6×6000=99600 K. At T=5500 K, ΔE/kT=99600/5500≈18.11, so n2/n1≈exp(−18.11)≈1.4×10−8.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7wYa:
n2/n1 ≃ 1.4×10^-8

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2, determine the factor by which the ratio of Ti atoms changes from the no-spot condition to the spot condition.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
