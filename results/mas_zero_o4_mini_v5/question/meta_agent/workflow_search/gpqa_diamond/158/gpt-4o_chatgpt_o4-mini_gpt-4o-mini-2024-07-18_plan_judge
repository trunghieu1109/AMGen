Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 158_Iteration_0
proposed answer: To compute the comoving distance for z≈5.5 in a flat ΛCDM (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7), we evaluate D_C = (c/H₀) ∫₀^{5.5} dz'/√(Ωₘ(1+z')³+ΩΛ). Numerical integration (Simpson’s rule or finer quadrature) gives ∫₀^{5.5} dz/E(z) ≈1.85–1.87, so D_C ≈ (3×10⁵ km/s / 70 km/s/Mpc)×1.86 ≈8.0×10³ Mpc ≈8.0 Gpc.

Answer:Comoving distance ≈8.0 Gpc
Extracted answer: Comoving distance ≈8.0 Gpc
Correct answer: 0

proposed answer: To compute the comoving distance D_C for z≈5.5 in a flat ΛCDM cosmology (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), evaluate D_C = (c/H₀) ∫₀^{5.5} dz'/√[Ωₘ(1+z')³+Ω_Λ]. Numerically this integral is ≃7.8×10³ Mpc, which rounds to 8 Gpc.

Answer:8 Gpc
Extracted answer: 8 Gpc
Correct answer: 0
