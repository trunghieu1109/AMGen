            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

Given K1\u221d5\u2009m\u00c5 and K2\u221d7\u2009m\u00c5, we have K2/K1=(P1/P2)^(1/3)=7/5=1.4, so P2/P1=(5/7)^3\u22480.36, corresponding to choice A). However, since the sub\u2010tasks didn\u2019t provide direct period measurements, this is an inference from the amplitude ratio.\n\nAnswer:A)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the measured orbital period of planet #1 (time\u2010series periodicity) to confirm and derive the absolute periods.",
