Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Initial NN 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0. Emitted X has intrinsic parity –1, so parity conservation η_X(–1)^{l+L_NN}=+1 ⇒ l+L_NN odd. Angular momentum conservation J_initial=0 ⇒ J_NN=l. For T(NN)=0, Pauli requires S_NN+L_NN odd. Choice A (3P0+s) has S_NN=1, L_NN=1 ⇒ S+L=2 even, violating Pauli. All other choices satisfy the constraints.
