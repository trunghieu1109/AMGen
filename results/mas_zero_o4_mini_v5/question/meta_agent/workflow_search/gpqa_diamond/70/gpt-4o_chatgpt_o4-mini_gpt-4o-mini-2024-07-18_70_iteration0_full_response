From Kepler’s third law a ∝ P^(2/3), so Teq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).; answer: The equilibrium temperature scales with orbital period as Teq ∝ P^(-1/3).\nCoT agent MGJz, on the purpose of calculating temperature ratio, thinking: Using Teq ∝ P^(−1/3), we have Teq4/Teq2 = (P4/P2)^(−1/3) = (3.5/2)^(−1/3) ≈ 1.75^(−1/3) ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.; answer: ~0.83\nCritic agent DyfH, on the purpose of reviewing temperature ratio calculation, feedback: The computation correctly applies Teq ∝ P^(−1/3) with P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.
