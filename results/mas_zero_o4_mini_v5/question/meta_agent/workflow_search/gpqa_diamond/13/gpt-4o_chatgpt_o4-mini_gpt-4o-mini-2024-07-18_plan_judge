Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 13_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The disappearing peaks are those captured by PFA alone (direct, high-affinity IKAROSâ€“DNA sites) but lost when DSG+PFA is used. These correspond to sites of strong, direct binding typical of active promoters and enhancers.
