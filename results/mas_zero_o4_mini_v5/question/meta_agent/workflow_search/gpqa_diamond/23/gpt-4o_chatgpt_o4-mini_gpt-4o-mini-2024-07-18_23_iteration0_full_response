This fits equimolar cyclohexene + benzene.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN:\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. It decolorizes bromine water because cyclohexene adds Br₂ across its C=C. When heated with platinum, cyclohexene transfers hydrogen to benzene: cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, yielding an equimolar mixture Y of benzene and cyclohexane.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, evaluate the properties and reactions of mixture Y, including why it does not decolorize bromine water. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0UjO:\nFrom sub-task 1, mixture X (cyclohexene + benzene) disproportionates on Pt to give benzene (from cyclohexene dehydrogenation) and cyclohexane (from benzene hydrogenation). Thus mixture Y is equimolar benzene + cyclohexane. Neither has C=C bonds that react with Br₂: cyclohexane is saturated, benzene does not undergo addition without catalysts. Hence Y does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y over Pt yields only cyclohexane.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0UjO:\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. It does not decolorize bromine water because neither component has C=C bonds available for addition: cyclohexane is fully saturated, and benzene does not add Br₂ under these conditions.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, identify substance Z using the given mass fraction of hydrogen and its properties. \n\n ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5Np2:\nThe hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% corresponds to C6H12 (12 H atoms out of molar mass 84).

This fits equimolar cyclohexene + benzene.; answer: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and benzene. It decolorizes bromine water because cyclohexene adds Br₂ across its C=C. When heated with platinum, cyclohexene transfers hydrogen to benzene: cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, yielding an equimolar mixture Y of benzene and cyclohexane.\nCoT-SC agent 0UjO, on the purpose of evaluating mixture Y, thinking: From sub-task 1, mixture X (cyclohexene + benzene) disproportionates on Pt to give benzene (from cyclohexene dehydrogenation) and cyclohexane (from benzene hydrogenation). Thus mixture Y is equimolar benzene + cyclohexane. Neither has C=C bonds that react with Br₂: cyclohexane is saturated, benzene does not undergo addition without catalysts. Hence Y does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y over Pt yields only cyclohexane.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. It does not decolorize bromine water because neither component has C=C bonds available for addition: cyclohexane is fully saturated, and benzene does not add Br₂ under these conditions.\nCoT-SC agent 5Iw6, on the purpose of evaluating mixture Y, thinking: From sub-task 1 we found mixture Y is equimolar benzene + cyclohexane. Bromine water only reacts with C=C double bonds (e.g., alkenes) but neither benzene (resists addition under mild conditions) nor cyclohexane (saturated) add Br₂ under these conditions. Hence mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane; neither compound contains a reactive C=C bond under normal conditions, so the mixture does not decolorize bromine water.\nCoT-SC agent IzMX, on the purpose of evaluating mixture Y, thinking: Based on sub-task 1, mixture Y is formed when cyclohexene transfers hydrogen to benzene over Pt: cyclohexene → benzene and benzene → cyclohexane. Thus Y is an equimolar mix of benzene and cyclohexane. Both lack C=C bonds (benzene is aromatic and resists addition, cyclohexane is saturated), so they cannot add Br₂ and thus won’t decolorize bromine water.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. It does not decolorize bromine water because neither component has an ordinary C=C bond available for electrophilic addition.\nCoT agent 5Np2, on the purpose of identifying substance Z, thinking: Mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28% corresponds to C6H12 (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of both mixture X and Y yields cyclohexane only, it’s saturated and widely used as a solvent.; answer: cyclohexane\nCritic agent M6D3, on the purpose of reviewing substance Z, thinking: The answer is correct. A hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% corresponds to formula CnH2n, and the only saturated C6H12 widely used as a solvent—which does not react further with hydrogen—is cyclohexane. No alternative fits all given properties.; answer: cyclohexane\nCoT agent 5Np2, on the purpose of refining substance Z, thinking: The hydrogen mass fraction 14.28% corresponds to C6H12 (12\u2009H atoms). Hydrogenation of both mixtures yields only this saturated hydrocarbon, which is widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen. Hence Z is cyclohexane.; answer: cyclohexane\nCritic agent M6D3, on the purpose of reviewing substance Z, thinking: The answer correctly identifies Z as cyclohexane. The hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% matches C6H12 (12\u2009H out of molar mass 84), it is fully hydrogenated, non‐reactive under further hydrogenation, and is a common solvent. No conjugated bonds are present, so the reasoning is sound.; answer: cyclohexane\nCoT agent 5Np2, on the purpose of refining substance Z, thinking: The hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% corresponds to C6H12 (12 H out of molar mass 84). This saturated hydrocarbon is produced by hydrogenation of both mixtures and is a common solvent that does not undergo further hydrogenation.; answer: Substance Z is cyclohexane.\nCritic agent M6D3, on the purpose of reviewing substance Z, thinking: The identification is correct. Cyclohexane (C6H12) has a hydrogen mass fraction of 12/84 ≈ 14.28%, is fully saturated and does not further hydrogenate, and is indeed a common solvent. No alternative isomer (e.g. methylcyclopentane) is as widely used in this role, so cyclohexane is the best choice.; answer: Substance Z is cyclohexane.\nCoT agent 5Np2, on the purpose of refining substance Z, thinking: The hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% corresponds to C6H12 (12 H atoms out of molar mass 84).
