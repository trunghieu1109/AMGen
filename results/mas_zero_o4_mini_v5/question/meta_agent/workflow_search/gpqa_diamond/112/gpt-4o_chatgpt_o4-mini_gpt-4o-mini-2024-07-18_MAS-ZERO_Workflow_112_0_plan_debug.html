    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.&#39;, choice1=&#39;C6H10O2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C6H12O&#39;, choice3=&#39;C6H10O&#39;, choice4=&#39;C6H12O2&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 4: Based on the FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry analysis, determine the chemical formula from the options. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent qx1M:
Combined spectroscopic data (broad O–H, C=O, C=C in IR; vinyl H’s in NMR; m/z 45 COOH⁺ in MS) indicate a carboxylic acid with an alkene, matching C6H10O2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7oa0:
The IR shows broad O–H (3000 cm⁻¹), C=O (1700 cm⁻¹), C=C (1650 cm⁻¹); the 1H NMR has vinyl protons; MS m/z 45 indicates COOH⁺ fragment. This matches a carboxylic acid with an alkene, formula C6H10O2.

### thinking by Debate Agent Lip6:
FTIR shows broad O–H (3000 cm⁻¹), C=O (1700 cm⁻¹), and C=C (1650 cm⁻¹); ¹H NMR shows vinyl H’s at δ5.0–6.5 ppm; MS m/z 45 fragment is COOH⁺, indicating a carboxylic acid with an alkene. The matching formula is C6H10O2.

### thinking by Debate Agent JIV3:
The IR shows broad O–H, C=O, and C=C stretches; NMR reveals vinyl protons; MS fragment m/z 45 is COOH⁺. These data match a carboxylic acid with an alkene, C6H10O2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Final decision on the chemical formula.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
