    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.&#39;, choice1=&#39;9.5*1e4 GeV&#39;, choice2=&#39;1.8*1e5 GeV&#39;, choice3=&#39;2.6*1e5 GeV&#39;, choice4=&#39;3.9*1e5 GeV&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the threshold energy for gamma rays to produce electron-positron pairs with CMB photons using the average photon energy of the CMB (10^-3 eV). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT:
Threshold for pair production: E_γ E_CMB ≥ m_e^2c^4. With m_e c^2=0.511 MeV and E_CMB=10^-3 eV=10^-9 MeV, we get E_γ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2/10^-9 MeV ≃0.261 MeV^2/10^-9 MeV=2.61×10^8 MeV=2.6×10^5 GeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT:
2.6*10^5 GeV

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, identify the correct choice among the options A, B, C, and D.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
