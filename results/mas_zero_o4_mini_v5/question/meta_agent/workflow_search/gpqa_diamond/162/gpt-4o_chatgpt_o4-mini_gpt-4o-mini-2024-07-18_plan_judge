Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 162_Iteration_0
proposed answer: From sub-task 3 we have [Fe³⁺]=9.36×10⁻³ M and pK₁≈2.2 for Fe³⁺ hydrolysis. Solving the equilibrium yields pH≈2.69.

Answer:pH ≈ 2.69
Extracted answer: pH ≈ 2.69
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 162_Iteration_0
proposed answer: From sub-task 3 we have added 0.1 M acid V = 30.09 mL into 100 mL total. Moles H⁺ initial = 0.1 M×0.03009 L = 3.009×10⁻³ mol. Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g/106.87 g mol⁻¹ ≈ 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol, which consumes 3×9.36×10⁻⁴ = 2.808×10⁻³ mol H⁺. Leftover H⁺ = 3.009×10⁻³ − 2.808×10⁻³ = 2.01×10⁻⁴ mol. In 0.100 L that is [H⁺] = 2.01×10⁻³ M, pH = −log[H⁺] ≈ 2.70.
