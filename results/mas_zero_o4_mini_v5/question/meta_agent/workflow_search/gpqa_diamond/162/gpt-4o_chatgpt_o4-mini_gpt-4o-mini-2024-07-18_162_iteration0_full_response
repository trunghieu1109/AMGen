At 0.1 M acid that requires V = n/C = 2.808×10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol·L⁻¹ = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.; answer: 28.08 cm³\nCoT agent DOx4, on calculating volume of acid, thinking: We need volume = moles H+ / concentration = 2.808×10−3 mol / 0.1 mol·L−1 = 2.808×10−2 L = 28.08 cm3.; answer: 28.08 cm3\nCoT agent AwyV, on calculating volume of acid, thinking: We need 2.808×10^−3 mol H+.

Calculating [H⁺] requires the first hydrolysis constant (Ka₁) or its pKa. Without that, we can only approximate assuming a typical pKa₁ (~2.2) to get pH≈2.12, but the exact value depends on the actual Ka₁.; answer: pH ≈2.1\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the first hydrolysis constant (Ka₁) or pKa₁ for Fe³⁺ to calculate the pH accurately.\nDebate agent X73Q, round 0, on calculating pH, thinking: To find the pH after adding exactly the stoichiometric amount of strong acid, all H⁺ is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃, leaving a solution of Fe³⁺. The pH is then set by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺: Ka1 = [FeOH²⁺][H⁺]/[Fe³⁺]. Without the hydrolysis constant for Fe³⁺, the exact pH can’t be determined.

The hydrolysis constant (Ka₁) for Fe³⁺ is not given, so an approximate value (e.g. Ka₁≈6.3×10⁻³, pKa₁≈2.2) must be assumed. Using C(Fe³⁺)=0.000936 mol/0.12808 L≈7.31×10⁻³ M and solving x²/(C−x)=Ka gives x≈4.33×10⁻³ M → pH≈2.36.
