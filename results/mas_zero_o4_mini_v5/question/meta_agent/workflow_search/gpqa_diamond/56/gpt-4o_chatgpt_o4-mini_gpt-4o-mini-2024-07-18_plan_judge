Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 56_Iteration_0
proposed answer: To compute Im f(0) numerically we need the wave number k. Using the given phase shifts we can only evaluate the partial‐wave sum Σ(2l+1)sin²δl. Without k we cannot obtain the numeric amplitude in fm.

Answer:Im f(0) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l = (1/k) × 10.8525
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the wave number k (or momentum) to compute the numerical value.
Extracted answer: Im f(0) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l = (1/k) × 10.8525
