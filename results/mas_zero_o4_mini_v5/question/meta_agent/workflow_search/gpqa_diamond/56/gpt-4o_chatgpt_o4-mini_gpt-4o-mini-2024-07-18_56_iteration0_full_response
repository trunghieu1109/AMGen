No multiple-choice format is required. Details are known from partial-wave expansion and the optical theorem, so no extra data is needed.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp:\nIn elastic scattering the total amplitude f(θ) is expanded in partial waves: \n\n f(θ)= (1/k) ∑ℓ (2ℓ+1)e^{iδℓ}sinδℓ Pℓ(cosθ).  \n\nAlong the forward direction (θ=0) the imaginary part is\n\n Im\u2009f(0)= (1/k) ∑ℓ (2ℓ+1)sin²δℓ.  \n\nThus each real phase shift δℓ contributes to Im\u2009f(0) through sin²δℓ, and by the optical theorem σ_total=(4π/k)Im\u2009f(0).  The larger the phase shift the larger the imaginary part of the forward amplitude.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude using the phase shifts δo=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent Kygp, on the purpose of understanding phase shifts, thinking: The user asks for an explanation of how phase shifts enter the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude.
