If in the ejecta frame the Galaxy’s center moves at 60 000 km/s toward the ejecta, then in the Galaxy frame the ejecta moves at 60 000 km/s toward the Galaxy center.; answer: 60000 km/s\nCoT agent nd4g, on the purpose of calculating time dilation, thinking: We use time dilation: Δt = γ Δτ, with Δτ = 50 s, v = 60000 km/s = 0.2 c. γ = 1/√(1−0.2²) ≃ 1.02062.
