Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 117_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The enol tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes rapid electrophilic α-bromination at C2, which is kinetically favored over alkene addition or tertiary C–H bromination, yielding the mono-bromoketone as the major product.
