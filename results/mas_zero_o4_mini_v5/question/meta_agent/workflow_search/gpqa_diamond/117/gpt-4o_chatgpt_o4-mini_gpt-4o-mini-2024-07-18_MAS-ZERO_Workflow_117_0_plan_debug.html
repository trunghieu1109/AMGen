Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the possible products from Sub-task 2, evaluate the stereochemistry and determine the major product. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Xcvd:
The enol rapidly tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes electrophilic α-bromination at C2 much faster than alkene addition or tertiary C–H bromination, yielding the mono-bromoketone as the predominant product.

### thinking by Debate Agent OPPM:
Under bromination conditions, the enol rapidly tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes fast electrophilic α-bromination at C2, which is kinetically favored over alkene addition or tertiary C–H bromination, giving the mono-bromo ketone as the major product.

### thinking by Debate Agent UaNN:
The enol tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes rapid electrophilic α‐bromination at C2, which is kinetically favored over vicinal dibromide formation or tertiary C–H bromination. Hence the mono-bromo ketone predominates.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZUcK:
Under bromination conditions, the enol tautomerizes rapidly to the ketone and undergoes electrophilic α-bromination at C2 much faster than addition across the double bond or tertiary C–H bromination, making the α-bromoketone the major product.

### answer by Debate Agent Xcvd:
2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

### answer by Debate Agent OPPM:
A)

### answer by Debate Agent UaNN:
A)

### answer by Debate Agent ZUcK:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of Sub-task 2, determine the major product.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
