Enols readily tautomerize to ketones and undergo electrophilic halogenation with bromine at the α-position, rather than simple vicinal dibromide formation, yielding α-bromoketones.; answer: Functional groups: an alkene (C=C) and an alcohol (enol). Type of reaction with Br2: electrophilic halogenation of the enol (via enol–ketone tautomerism) to give an α-bromoketone.\nCoT-SC agent ohb4, on the purpose of listing possible products, thinking: 4,4-Dimethylcyclopent-1-enol can undergo two types of bromine reactions: electrophilic bromination of the enol (after tautomerization to the ketone) to give an α-bromoketone, and direct addition of Br2 across the C=C double bond to give a vicinal dibromide. A less likely side reaction is bromination at the tertiary (4-)position of the ketone. Thus multiple products are possible.; answer: Possible products:\n- 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (α-bromoketone)\n- (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol (vicinal dibromide)\n- (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol (vicinal dibromide)\n- 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (tertiary bromination)\nCoT-SC agent Wt1F, on the purpose of listing possible products, thinking: Sub-task 1 predicts electrophilic halogenation of the enol via tautomerization to the ketone (α-bromination) as well as possible bromine addition across the C=C bond (vicinal dibromide). The α-bromoketone should be the major product, while the dihalide isomer (stereoisomeric pair) would be minor.; answer: Possible products: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone; (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol; (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.\nCoT-SC agent nJbR, on the purpose of listing possible products, thinking: Based on enol–ketone tautomerism, the enol can be brominated at the α-carbon to give 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Alternatively, bromine can add across the C=C of the enol to give vicinal dibromides with two stereochemical outcomes, and minor allylic/tertiary bromination could yield a mono-bromo ketone at C-4.; answer: Possible products:\n1) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\n2) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol\n3) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol\n4) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\nDebate agent Xcvd, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: The enol tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes rapid α-bromination. Electrophilic addition across the C=C and tertiary bromination are slower and minor. Thus the major product is the α-bromoketone.; answer: A)\nDebate agent OPPM, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Enol tautomer undergoes α‐bromination much faster than electrophilic addition or tertiary C–H bromination. Thus the α‐bromoketone predominates.; answer: A)\nDebate agent UaNN, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Under Br2, the enol tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes electrophilic α-bromination faster than alkene addition. The transient enol is more susceptible at C2, giving the mono-bromo ketone as the major product.; answer: A)\nDebate agent ZUcK, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: 4,4-Dimethylcyclopent-1-enol rapidly tautomerizes to the corresponding ketone under bromination conditions, and enol bromination at the α-position is faster and more favorable than halogen addition across the double bond or tertiary bromination. Thus the α-bromoketone predominates.; answer: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\nDebate agent Xcvd, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Under bromination conditions, the enol tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes fast α‐bromination at C2, making the α‐bromoketone the major product.; answer: A)\nDebate agent OPPM, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Under bromination conditions the enol tautomer rapidly converts to the ketone and undergoes electrophilic α-bromination far faster than addition across the double bond or tertiary bromination, giving the α-bromoketone as the major product.; answer: A)\nDebate agent UaNN, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Under bromination conditions the enol rapidly tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes electrophilic α‐bromination at C2 to give the α‐bromoketone.
