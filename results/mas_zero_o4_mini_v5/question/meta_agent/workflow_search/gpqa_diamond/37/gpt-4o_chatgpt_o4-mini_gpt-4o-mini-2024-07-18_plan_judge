Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 37_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The enamine is deprotonated by LDA to an aza-enolate, undergoes SN2 alkylation with ethyl iodide, and acid hydrolysis yields heptan-4-one. Only choice 4 matches this sequence with B = heptan-4-one.
