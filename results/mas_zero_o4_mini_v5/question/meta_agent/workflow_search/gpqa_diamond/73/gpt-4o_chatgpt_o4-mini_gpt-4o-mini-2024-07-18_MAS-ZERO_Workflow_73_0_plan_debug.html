    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, choice1=&#39;52%&#39;, choice2=&#39;48%&#39;, choice3=&#39;44%&#39;, choice4=&#39;40%&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the decay rate from the given probability of 32% within 100 minutes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent hPUk:
We have exponential decay P(t)=1−e^(−λt). Given P(100)=0.32⇒e^(−λ·100)=0.68⇒λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386 min^−1.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent hPUk:
λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min^−1

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pc1Q (yourself):
For an exponential decay with λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386 min⁻¹, the process is memoryless. The probability of decay in the next 150 min is 1−e^(−λ·150)=1−e^(−0.00386·150)≈0.44 (44%).

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pc1Q (yourself):
C)

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, review the calculation for decay probability in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent KCqK:
The calculation correctly applies the memoryless property of exponential decay. From P(decay ≤100)=0.32 we get λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386 min⁻¹. Then P(decay in next 150 min)=1−e^(−λ·150)≈44%.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pc1Q (yourself):
For exponential decay, P(decay in time t)=1−e^(−λt). Given P(100)=0.32 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386. Memoryless implies P(decay in next 150 min)=1−e^(−λ·150)≈1−e^(−0.00386·150)≈0.44 or 44%.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, review the calculation for decay probability in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent KCqK:
The reasoning correctly applies the memoryless property of exponential decay. From P(100)=0.32 we get λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386, then P(next 150) = 1 - e^{-λ·150} ≈ 0.44 (44%).

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pc1Q (yourself):
For exponential decay with rate λ≈−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386 min⁻¹, the memoryless property gives P(decay in next 150 min)=1−e^(−λ·150)≈1−e^(−0.00386·150)≈0.44.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pc1Q (yourself):
C)

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, review the calculation for decay probability in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent KCqK:
The calculation is correct. Using the known 32% decay probability in 100 min gives λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹. By the memoryless property, P(decay in next 150 min) = 1 − e^(−λ·150) ≈ 0.4477, or about 44%.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes.
