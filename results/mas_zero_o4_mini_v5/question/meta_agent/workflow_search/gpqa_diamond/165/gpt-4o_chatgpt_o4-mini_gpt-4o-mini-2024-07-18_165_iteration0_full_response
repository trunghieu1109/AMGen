No tree‐level mass term is present.; answer: The following Lagrangian terms feed into the radiative mass of H₂:\n1) The singlet‐fermion Yukawa: −½\u2009y_i\u2009φ\u2009N_{iR}^c\u2009N_{iR}^c\n2) The scalar‐doublet Yukawa: −g_{iα}\u2009\x08ar N_{iR}\u2009L_α\u2009S\n3) The S kinetic term: |D^μ\u2009S|^2 (gauge couplings to W,Z)\n4) The SM top Yukawa from L_SM: y_t\u2009\x08ar Q\u2009H\u2009t_R\n5) The scalar potential V(φ,S,H), in particular φ^2\u2009H†H and S†S\u2009φ^2 quartics\nThese interactions break the global symmetry explicitly and generate M_{H₂} at one loop.\nCoT agent kYq7, on the purpose of deriving mass formula, thinking: The pseudo-Goldstone H₂ mass arises at one-loop from explicit symmetry-breaking interactions: scalar quartics, gauge loops of S, SM top Yukawa, and singlet-fermion Yukawas.
