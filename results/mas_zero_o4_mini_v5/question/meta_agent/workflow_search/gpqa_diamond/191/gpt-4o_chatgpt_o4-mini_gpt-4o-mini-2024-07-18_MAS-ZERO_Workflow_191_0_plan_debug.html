    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the correct choice for the electric field at point P from the given options. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent DtnW:
For any point outside an uncharged conducting sphere with internal charge +q, the external field is that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s center: E = q/(4πε₀L²). Among the options, choice4 corresponds to 1/(4πε₀)·q/L², which is option D).

### thinking by Debate Agent kMIH:
By Gauss’s law, for points outside the conductor (L&gt;R) the field is as if the entire charge +q is at the center, giving E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L², which matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent lRDI:
By Gauss’s law, for any point outside the spherical conductor (L &gt; R), the induced charges ensure the external field is that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s center, giving E = q/(4πε₀ L²), which matches choice 4.

### answer by Debate Agent DtnW:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent kMIH:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent lRDI:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make the final decision based on all debates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
