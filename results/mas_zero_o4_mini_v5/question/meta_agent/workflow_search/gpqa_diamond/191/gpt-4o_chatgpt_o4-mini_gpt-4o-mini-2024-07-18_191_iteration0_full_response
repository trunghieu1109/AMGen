This is straightforward: induced charges on cavity and outer surfaces ensure field inside the conductor is zero, and the external field behaves as if the net charge resides at the conductor’s center.; answer: When a charge +q is placed inside a cavity within a conductor, the conductor’s free electrons rearrange to cancel any field within its bulk. Negative induced charge –q appears on the cavity wall, exactly shielding the conductor material. An equal +q appears on the outer surface. For points outside (distance L from the conductor’s center), the field is radial and as if a point charge +q were at the center: E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L². Inside the cavity, the field is determined by the cavity shape and position of +q, but never penetrates into the conductor material.\nCoT agent T3fz, on the purpose of calculating electric field, thinking: From sub-task 1, the conductor shields internal fields and carries net charge +q on its outer surface. By Gauss’s law, for any point outside the sphere, the field is as if a point charge +q were concentrated at the centre.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2} , directed radially outward\nCritic agent qhoX, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning is sound. Inside the conductor the field is zero and all induced charge resides on the outer surface so, by Gauss’s law for any point P with L>R, the field is exactly that of a point charge +q at the centre. The result E= (1/4πε₀)·q/L² directed radially outward is correct.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2} (radially outward)\nCoT agent T3fz, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The conductor’s induced charges ensure that any external point sees the full charge +q concentrated at the centre. By Gauss’s law, for L>R the field magnitude is E=(1/4πε₀)·q/L², directed radially outward.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}, directed radially outward\nCritic agent qhoX, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The calculation correctly applies Gauss’s law and the property that a conductor with total charge +q behaves externally like a point charge located at its center. Thus for L>R the field is indeed E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² directed radially outward.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}, directed radially outward\nCoT agent T3fz, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The induced charges on the conductor ensure that externally the field is identical to that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s center. By Gauss’s law, for any point P with L>R, the magnitude is E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² directed radially outward.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}, directed radially outward\nCritic agent qhoX, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: Your calculation is correct. By the conductor’s shielding effect, all induced charges redistribute so that outside the sphere the field is identical to that of a point charge +q at its center. Applying Gauss’s law for L>R then yields E=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}, directed radially outward.; answer: E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}, directed radially outward\nCoT agent T3fz, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: By Gauss’s law, for any point outside the spherical conductor (L > R), the induced charges ensure that the external field is exactly that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s center.
