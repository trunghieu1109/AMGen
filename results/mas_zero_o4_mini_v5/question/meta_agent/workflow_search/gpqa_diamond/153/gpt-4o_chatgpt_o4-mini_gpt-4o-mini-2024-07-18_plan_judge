Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 153_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The mass spectrum shows a 3:1 chlorine isotopic pattern at M+ 156/158 suggesting one Cl atom. IR reveals a carboxylic acid (broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H and sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O). ¹H NMR has a COOH proton at 11.0 ppm and two sets of aromatic doublets (2H each), consistent with a para‐disubstituted benzene. Together these data best fit 4‐chlorobenzoic acid.

Answer:4-chlorobenzoic acid

proposed answer: The molecular ion peaks at m/z 156/158 (3:1) indicate one Cl atom. IR shows broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ and strong 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm (COOH) and two aromatic doublets (2H each) indicate a para‐substituted benzene. Together this matches 4‐chlorobenzoic acid.
