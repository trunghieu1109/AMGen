    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, choice1=&#39;~2.25&#39;, choice2=&#39;~2.35&#39;, choice3=&#39;~2.32&#39;, choice4=&#39;~2.23\n&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 based on the given radius and mass ratio. Use the formula for luminosity in terms of radius and temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SFAX:
Since both stars have the same surface temperature (λmax identical → T1=T2), luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2·(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2·1 = 2.25.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent SFAX:
2.25

### Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, analyze the impact of the same wavelength (temperature) on the luminosity ratio. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 22L7:
Identical peak wavelengths imply equal surface temperatures. By Stefan–Boltzmann law (L ∝ R²T⁴), if T₁=T₂ the T⁴ terms cancel, leaving L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²=(1.5)²=2.25.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 22L7:
With the same wavelength (and thus same temperature), the luminosity ratio depends solely on the stars’ surface areas: L1/L2=(R1/R2)²=2.25.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, consider the radial velocities&#39; effect on the luminosity ratio. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent vt9J:
We compute the redshift z≈700 km/s ÷ 3×10^5 km/s ≈0.00233. Since λ_max,obs is the same, Star_2’s emission temperature is T₂=T_obs(1+z), while T₁=T_obs. Thus L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂)⁴=2.25/(1+z)⁴≈2.23. If one instead applies the correction multiplicatively, one finds ≈2.27. In either case the Doppler effect alters the ratio by ≲1%, so L₁/L₂ remains essentially ≈2.25.

### answer by Final Decision Agent vt9J:
The Doppler shift introduces a &lt;1% correction, adjusting L₁/L₂ from 2.25 to ≈2.23–2.27 (essentially unchanged).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, determine the correct answer from the given choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
