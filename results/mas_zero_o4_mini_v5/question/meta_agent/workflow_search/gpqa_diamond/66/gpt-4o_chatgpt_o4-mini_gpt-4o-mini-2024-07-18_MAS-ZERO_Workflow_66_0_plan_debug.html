    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;1&#39;, choice2=&#39;1/2&#39;, choice3=&#39;0&#39;, choice4=&#39;2/3&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Analyze the coupled angular momentum state |l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. Identify the quantum numbers and their implications. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9L8k:
We need to state the individual and total orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, and explain their physical meaning: l1 and l2 are both 1 (p‐orbitals), l=2 indicates the D‐state of the two‐electron system, and m=–1 is the z‐component of the total L. No crucial information is missing and the question isn&#39;t overly complex, so no [TOO_HARD] is needed.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9L8k:
For the state |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, –1⟩:
• l₁ = 1: electron 1 is in a p orbital (orbital angular momentum quantum number 1).
• l₂ = 1: electron 2 is in a p orbital.
• l = 2: total orbital angular momentum of the two‐electron system; this is the D‐state (2ℏ√l(l+1)=√6ℏ total magnitude).
• m = –1: the z‐component of the total L is –ℏ.
Implications:
• Individual m₁, m₂ values must sum to m: m₁ + m₂ = –1 (e.g. m₁=0, m₂=–1 or m₁=–1, m₂=0).
• The l=2 state is symmetric under particle exchange (spatial wavefunction symmetry).
• There are 2l+1 = 5 total m‐states for this D‐multiplet (from m=+2 down to m=–2).

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine the possible values of L_{1z} and L_{2z} and calculate the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues -\hbar for both. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent AtP5 (yourself):
The coupled state |1,1;2,−1&gt; expands in the uncoupled basis as (1/√2)|m₁=0,m₂=−1&gt; + (1/√2)|m₁=−1,m₂=0&gt;. Each term has amplitude 1/√2, so the probability for a given allowed pair is (1/√2)²=1/2.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent AtP5 (yourself):
B)

### Sub-task 2: Review the probability calculation above and provide feedback. If correct, output &#39;True&#39;. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 2x1h:
The calculation is incorrect. The state |1,1;2,−1⟩ expands only into |m₁=0,m₂=−1⟩ and |m₁=−1,m₂=0⟩, so there is no |−1,−1⟩ component and the joint probability for both L₁z and L₂z being −ℏ is 0.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and feedback, refine the probability calculation for L_{1z} and L_{2z} eigenvalues.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We expand |1,1;2,−1〉 in the uncoupled basis: it contains only |m₁=0,m₂=−1〉 and |m₁=−1,m₂=0〉, so there is no component with m₁=−1 and m₂=−1. Thus the joint probability is zero.
