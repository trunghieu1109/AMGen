Identify the quantum numbers and their implications. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9L8k:\nWe need to state the individual and total orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, and explain their physical meaning: l1 and l2 are both 1 (p‐orbitals), l=2 indicates the D‐state of the two‐electron system, and m=–1 is the z‐component of the total L. No crucial information is missing and the question isn\'t overly complex, so no [TOO_HARD] is needed.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9L8k:\nFor the state |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, –1⟩:\n• l₁ = 1: electron 1 is in a p orbital (orbital angular momentum quantum number 1).\n• l₂ = 1: electron 2 is in a p orbital.\n• l = 2: total orbital angular momentum of the two‐electron system; this is the D‐state (2ℏ√l(l+1)=√6ℏ total magnitude).\n• m = –1: the z‐component of the total L is –ℏ.\nImplications:\n• Individual m₁, m₂ values must sum to m: m₁ + m₂ = –1 (e.g. m₁=0, m₂=–1 or m₁=–1, m₂=0).\n• The l=2 state is symmetric under particle exchange (spatial wavefunction symmetry).\n• There are 2l+1 = 5 total m‐states for this D‐multiplet (from m=+2 down to m=–2).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine the possible values of L_{1z} and L_{2z} and calculate the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues -\\hbar for both. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent AtP5 (yourself):\nThe coupled state |1,1;2,−1> expands in the uncoupled basis as (1/√2)|m₁=0,m₂=−1> + (1/√2)|m₁=−1,m₂=0>. Each term has amplitude 1/√2, so the probability for a given allowed pair is (1/√2)²=1/2.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent AtP5 (yourself):\nB)\n\n### Sub-task 2: Review the probability calculation above and provide feedback. If correct, output \'True\'. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 2x1h:\nThe calculation is incorrect. The state |1,1;2,−1⟩ expands only into |m₁=0,m₂=−1⟩ and |m₁=−1,m₂=0⟩, so there is no |−1,−1⟩ component and the joint probability for both L₁z and L₂z being −ℏ is 0.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and feedback, refine the probability calculation for L_{1z} and L_{2z} eigenvalues.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents="CoT agent 9L8k, on analyzing quantum state, thinking: We need to state the individual and total orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, and explain their physical meaning: l1 and l2 are both 1 (p‐orbitals), l=2 indicates the D‐state of the two‐electron system, and m=–1 is the z‐component of the total L.
