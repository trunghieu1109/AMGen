Therefore, the kinetic property in acidic solutions is “slower.”; answer: slower\nCoT-SC agent iWQ8, on the purpose of determining kinetic property, thinking: In acidic solutions, the oxygen reduction reaction is kinetically sluggish, requiring high overpotentials due to slow electron transfer and adsorption steps. Thus its kinetic property is “slower.”; answer: slower\nCoT-SC agent y5Cv, on the purpose of determining kinetic property, thinking: The original multiple-choice answer indicated that kinetically, oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions (choice 'stronger – slower').
