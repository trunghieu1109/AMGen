    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, choice2=&#39;A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, choice3=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm&#39;, choice4=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 2: Final decision on product structures. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent RR5S:
The Diels–Alder between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene yields two norbornene‐type bicyclic anhydride isomers. Secondary orbital interactions favor the endo approach, giving the endo adduct as the major product and the exo adduct as the minor product.

### answer by Final Decision Agent RR5S:
Sub-task 2: The major product is the endo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride with four methyl groups on the former diene ring. The minor product is the corresponding exo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride with the same tetramethyl substitution pattern.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SYpb (yourself):
The endo adduct’s methyl groups (6H singlet ~1.7 ppm) are spatially close to the bridgehead protons (2H singlet ~3.5 ppm), giving a strong NOESY cross‐peak in the major product. Other pairs lack this proximity.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SYpb (yourself):
A)

### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the NOESY NMR analysis and correct if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent LU5j:
The previous assignment is incorrect: the NOESY cross-peak in the major endo adduct arises from spatial proximity between the bridgehead 1H (doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride CH2 (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), not the 6H methyls.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SYpb (yourself):
The NOESY cross-peak in the major endo adduct arises from spatial proximity between the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride CH2 (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), consistent with the critic’s correction.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SYpb (yourself):
B)

### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the NOESY NMR analysis and correct if necessary. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent LU5j:
Your NOESY NMR analysis is correct. The major (endo) adduct places the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) in close spatial proximity to the anhydride CH₂ protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), giving rise to the observed cross-peak.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SYpb (yourself):
The endo adduct places the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) in close spatial proximity to the anhydride CH2 protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), yielding the observed NOESY cross-peak.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SYpb (yourself):
B)

### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the NOESY NMR analysis and correct if necessary. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent LU5j:
The analysis is correct: in the endo adduct the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) lies close in space to the anhydride CH₂ protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), yielding the observed NOESY cross‐peak.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
