proposed answer: Red P and HI generate PI₃, which converts the carboxylic acid to the acyl iodide. That intermediate undergoes decarboxylation to give the alkyl iodide, which is further reduced by HI to the alkane.

Answer:sec-butylbenzene
Extracted answer: sec-butylbenzene

proposed answer: Red phosphorus and HI effect reductive decarboxylation of the benzoic acid, removing CO₂ and replacing the carboxyl group with hydrogen. The para-sec-butyl substituent remains, yielding sec-butylbenzene.
