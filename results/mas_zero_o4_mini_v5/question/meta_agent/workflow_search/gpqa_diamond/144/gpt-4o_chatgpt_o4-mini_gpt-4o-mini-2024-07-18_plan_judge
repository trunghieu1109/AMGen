Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 144_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Sub-task 1 gives 3 chiral centers (C5, C6, C9). Sub-task 2 gives 2 stereogenic C=C bonds (at C3–C4 and C7–C8). Total stereogenic elements = 3 + 2 = 5. Maximum stereoisomers = 2^5 = 32.
