Each C=C contributes one degree of unsaturation and with no rings or additional unsaturations, total DoU = 2.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; the compound has two double bonds at C3–C4 and C7–C8 and contains no rings.\nDebate agent KH68, round 0, on identifying structural features, thinking: We calculate the molecular formula C14H25ClO and use DU = (2C+2–H–X)/2 = (28+2–25–1)/2 = 2. These correspond exactly to the two C=C bonds; no rings are present.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; double bonds at C3–C4 and C7–C8; no rings.\nDebate agent W2QW, round 0, on identifying structural features, thinking: The molecule has 14 carbons, one oxygen, one chlorine, and two C=C double bonds; no rings are present. Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation, so the total DU = 2.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; contains two C=C double bonds and no rings.\nDebate agent HRB5, round 0, on identifying structural features, thinking: Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated from the number of rings and multiple bonds. The name indicates two C=C double bonds (at C3–C4 and C7–C8), no rings, and no other unsaturations (OH and halogen don’t contribute). Thus DoU = 2.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; double bonds at C3–C4 and C7–C8; no rings.\nDebate agent 5Txo, round 1, on identifying structural features, thinking: Using the molecular formula (C14H25ClO) and DU formula DU = (2C + 2 – H – X)/2 = (28 + 2 – 25 – 1)/2 = 2. The compound name also indicates two C=C double bonds and no rings.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; two C=C double bonds at C3–C4 and C7–C8; no rings present.\nDebate agent KH68, round 1, on identifying structural features, thinking: We use the molecular formula C14H25ClO and the formula DU = (2C + 2 – H – X)/2 = (28 + 2 – 25 – 1)/2 = 2. Each degree corresponds to one C=C double bond. There are no rings or other unsaturations.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; contains two C=C double bonds at C3–C4 and C7–C8; no rings present.\nDebate agent W2QW, round 1, on identifying structural features, thinking: All agents agree the molecule has two C=C double bonds (at C3–C4 and C7–C8) and no rings. The formula C14H25ClO gives DoU = (2·14+2–25–1)/2 = 2, matching the two double bonds.; answer: Degree of unsaturation = 2; two C=C double bonds at C3–C4 and C7–C8; no rings.\nDebate agent HRB5, round 1, on identifying structural features, thinking: The compound name indicates two C=C double bonds (at C3–C4 and C7–C8) and no rings. Each double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation, halogens and OH do not.
