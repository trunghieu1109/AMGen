Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 146_Iteration_0
proposed answer: We have total energy 1876 MeV from annihilation, divided equally among 4 A particles gives 469 MeV each. Using rest energy 300 MeV yields γ≈1.563 and β≈√(1−1/γ²)≈0.77c, corresponding to choice C).
