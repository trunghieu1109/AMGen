There is enough information (masses of p and A, slow antiproton) to perform a threshold‐level energy balance in the CM frame. No extra marks or info requests are needed.; answer: In the center‐of‐mass frame (antiproton nearly at rest in the lab), the total available energy is E_tot ≃ m_p c² + m_{p̄} c² = 2·938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Producing four A particles requires rest energy 4·m_A c² = 4·300 MeV = 1200 MeV, leaving 676 MeV of kinetic energy to be shared. By symmetry (and momentum conservation), each A carries 676 MeV/4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Thus each A has total energy E_A = 300 MeV + 169 MeV = 469 MeV, so γ_A = 469/300 ≃ 1.56 and β_A = √(1−1/γ_A²) ≃ 0.78\u2009c. Conservation of energy ensures the rest‐mass and kinetic energies sum to E_tot, and momentum conservation is satisfied by the symmetric back‐to‐back emission of the four A particles.\nCoT agent NsYj, on the purpose of calculating total energy, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we found the total available energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton rest energies: E_tot = m_p c² + m_{p̄} c² = 2×938\u2009MeV = 1876\u2009MeV.; answer: 1876 MeV\nCoT agent OEUE, on the purpose of calculating total energy, thinking: The total initial energy comes from the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.
