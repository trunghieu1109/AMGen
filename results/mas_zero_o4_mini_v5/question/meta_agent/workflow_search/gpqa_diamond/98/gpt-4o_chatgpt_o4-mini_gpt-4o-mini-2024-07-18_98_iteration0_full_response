Together these match the carboxylic acid functional group.; answer: O–H stretch (broad at ~3000 cm⁻¹) and C=O stretch (strong at ~1700 cm⁻¹) indicating a carboxylic acid\nCoT agent 2du8, on the purpose of analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The question asks to interpret the two complex multiplets in the 1H NMR—the doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and the doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)—and assign them to specific hydrogen environments in a carboxylic acid with no vinyl protons. These patterns arise only if there are two nonequivalent methine (CH) protons each coupled to multiple alkyl groups. The dtq requires coupling to three different sets of protons (one CH3 giving a doublet, one CH2 giving a triplet, and another CH3 giving a quartet), while the dtt requires coupling to three similar but nonidentical sets (two CH2 groups and one CH3 all giving triplets).; answer: Environment 1 (dtq): methine proton on a carbon bonded to one methyl and one ethyl group, split by CH3 (doublet), CH2 (triplet), and CH3 (quartet).\nEnvironment 2 (dtt): methine proton on a carbon bonded to two ethyl groups, split by two CH2’s (triplets) and one CH3 (triplet).\nCoT agent I6aY, on the purpose of analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The splitting patterns can be rationalized by two inequivalent methine protons, each coupling to three distinct neighboring proton sets. A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) arises when a CH proton couples to one CH (doublet), one CH2 (triplet) and one CH3 (quartet). A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) arises when a CH couples to one CH (doublet) and two non-equivalent CH2 groups (two triplets). The lack of vinyl signals confirms a fully saturated framework with two methine centers each bearing different alkyl substituents.; answer: Signal 1 (dtq): methine H_a coupling to one CH (doublet), one CH2 (triplet) and one CH3 (quartet).  Signal 2 (dtt): methine H_b coupling to one CH (doublet) and two CH2 groups (two triplets).  No vinyl H signals → all aliphatic environments.\nCoT agent M1T9, on the purpose of analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The broad IR band at ~3000\u2009cm⁻¹ and strong C=O stretch confirm a carboxylic acid. In the ¹H NMR, the absence of vinyl signals rules out unsaturation. A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) arises when a methine proton (CH) is coupled to one neighboring CH (1\u2009H, giving the doublet), to a CH₂ (2\u2009H, giving the triplet), and to a CH₃ (3\u2009H, giving the quartet). A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) comes from a methine proton coupled to one CH (1\u2009H) and two different CH₂ groups (2\u2009H each), each giving a triplet. Thus one CH is adjacent to a methyl and an ethyl substituent, and the other CH is flanked by two ethyl substituents.; answer: The dtq signal corresponds to a methine H coupled to 1\u2009H (CH), 2\u2009H (CH₂) and 3\u2009H (CH₃). The dtt signal corresponds to a methine H coupled to 1\u2009H (CH) and two distinct CH₂ groups (2\u2009H each). These patterns indicate one CH bearing an ethyl and a methyl substituent and another CH bearing two ethyl substituents.\nDebate agent T38g, round 0, on the purpose of identifying compound, thinking: Sub-task 1 identifies a carboxylic acid (broad OH at ~3000\u2009cm⁻¹, C=O at 1700\u2009cm⁻¹). Sub-task 2 assigns dtq to a CH bonded to CH3, CH2, and CH, and dtt to a CH bonded to CH3 and two CH2’s. Only CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (choice 3) fits both patterns.; answer: C)\nDebate agent QGR5, round 0, on the purpose of identifying compound, thinking: Sub-task 1 confirmed carboxylic acid (broad OH at 3000 cm⁻¹, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹). Sub-task 2 assigned dtq to a CH bonded to CH3 + C2H5 and dtt to a CH bonded to two C2H5. Only CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH fits these environments.; answer: C)\nDebate agent r2fc, round 0, on the purpose of identifying compound, thinking: From the FTIR we have a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows two distinct methine environments: one (dtq) from a CH bonded to a methyl and an ethyl, and one (dtt) from a CH bonded to two ethyl‐type CH2 groups.
