Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 192_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Given N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/r, we have N(r)dr ∝ r^5 * dplx/dr * dr = r^5 * (−1/r^2) dr ∝ r^3 dr, so N(r) ∝ r^3.
