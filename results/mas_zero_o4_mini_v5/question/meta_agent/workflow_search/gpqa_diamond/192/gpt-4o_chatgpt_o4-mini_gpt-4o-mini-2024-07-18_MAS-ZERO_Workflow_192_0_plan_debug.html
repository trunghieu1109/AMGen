    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ r^2&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ r^4&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ r^3&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ r^5&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, analyze the results to determine which choice (A, B, C, D) correctly describes the change in the number of stars with distance. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 9LWy:
Given N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and parallax plx = 1/r, thus N(plx) ∝ r^5. Converting to per-unit-distance: N(r)dr = N(plx)*(dplx/dr)dr ∝ r^5*(1/r^2)dr = r^3 dr, so N(r) ∝ r^3, matching choice C).

### thinking by Debate Agent iwXF:
Given N(plx)∝1/plx^5 and plx=1/r, we find N(r)∝r^3, matching choice C.

### thinking by Debate Agent EmwU:
We have N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/r, so N(r) ∝ r^3, matching choice C).

### thinking by Debate Agent zk75:
Given N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/r, we get N(r)dr ∝ r^5*(1/r^2)dr = r^3 dr, so N(r) ∝ r^3.

### answer by Debate Agent 9LWy:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent iwXF:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
