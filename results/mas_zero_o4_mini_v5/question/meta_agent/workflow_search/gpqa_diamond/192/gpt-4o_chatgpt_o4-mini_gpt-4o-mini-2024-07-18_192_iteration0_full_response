Thus plx (in arcsec) = 1/r (in parsec). Solving gives r = 1/plx. This is the standard distance–parallax relation.; answer: Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Stellar parallax (plx) is defined as the apparent shift of a star’s position due to Earth’s orbit, measured in arcseconds.\n2. By definition, a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond: plx(arcsec) = 1 / r(parsec).\n3. Rearranging gives the distance in parsecs as\n   r = 1 / plx\nThus the mathematical relationship is r = 1/plx (with r in parsecs when plx is in arcseconds).\nCoT agent hnfB, on the purpose of determining number of stars variation, thinking: We have N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. With plx = 1/r, plx^-5 = r^5. But N(r)dr = N(plx)|dplx| = k r^5 * (1/r^2) dr ∝ r^3 dr. Hence N(r) ∝ r^3.; answer: C)\nCritic agent vamR, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The answer is correct. Starting from N(plx) ∝ plx^–5 and using plx = 1/r gives N(plx) ∝ r^5. Converting to distance space via N(r) dr = N(plx) |dplx/dr| dr and |dplx/dr| = 1/r^2 yields N(r) ∝ r^3, matching the provided answer.; answer: True\nDebate agent 9LWy, round 0, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: Sub-task 2 found N(r) ∝ r^3, which corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent iwXF, round 0, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: From sub-task 2 we have N(r) ∝ r^3, which corresponds to choice C (∼ r^3).; answer: C)\nDebate agent EmwU, round 0, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: From N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx=1/r, we get N(r)dr ∝ r^5·(1/r^2)dr ∝ r^3 dr, so N(r) ∝ r^3, corresponding to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent zk75, round 0, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: From sub-task 2 we found N(r)∝r^3, which corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 9LWy, round 1, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: Sub-task 2 yielded N(r)∝r^3, which directly corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent iwXF, round 1, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: From sub-task 2 we derived N(r) ∝ r^3, which matches choice C.; answer: C)\nDebate agent EmwU, round 1, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: From N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/r, we get N(r) ∝ r^3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent zk75, round 1, on the purpose of determining correct choice, thinking: We have N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx=1/r, so N(plx) ∝ r^5.
