Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We list allowed configurations of four spin-1/2 fermions in 1D infinite well with max two per level. The ground {1,1,2,2}=10E, first excited {1,1,2,3}=15E. The next smallest sum is {1,2,2,3}=1+4+4+9=18E.

proposed answer: To find the second excited state, compare possible single- and double-excitation energy costs from the ground state (10E). The smallest next cost is promoting one fermion from n=1 (energy 1E) to n=3 (9E), a +8E increase. So the second excited state energy is 10E + 8E = 18E.
