Thus CH₃COOH is not suitable for reagent B.; correct: False\nCoT agent MbCN, on the purpose of refining reagent B, thinking: Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strong acid or base; acetic acid is too weak. A strong acid like HCl is appropriate for direct acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.; answer: HCl\nCritic agent xj4a, on the purpose of refining reagent B, feedback: Correct.
