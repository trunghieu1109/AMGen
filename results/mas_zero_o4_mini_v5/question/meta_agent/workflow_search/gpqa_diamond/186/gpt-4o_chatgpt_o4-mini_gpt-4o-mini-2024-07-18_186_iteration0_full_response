No critical missing info, so no [TOO_HARD] needed.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8Eaz:\nESPRESSO is a fibre-fed, cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph at ESO’s Paranal Observatory, fed by one or all four 8.2\u2009m VLT Unit Telescopes. Key capabilities:\n• Wavelength coverage: ≈380\u2009–\u2009788\u2009nm.\n• High-resolution modes: R≈140 000 (single UT), R≈190 000 (ultra‐high, single UT), and R≈70 000 (multi-UT, combined light).\n• Radial-velocity precision: down to ≈10\u2009cm/s for bright targets (using simultaneous reference calibration).\n• High throughput and stability: vacuum-enclosed, temperature‐controlled bench, allowing long-term stability better than 1\u2009m/s.\n• Sensitivity: achieves S/N≈10 per binned pixel in a 1\u2009hr exposure on targets as faint as V≈16–17\u2009mag (in 4-UT mode).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the expected S/N for each star and determine if it meets the detectability threshold. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Abqx:\nWe need the S/N vs magnitude performance for ESPRESSO in single-UT mode to compute S/N for each star precisely.
