    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, choice1=&#39;10 MeV.&#39;, choice2=&#39;5 MeV.&#39;, choice3=&#39;2 MeV.&#39;, choice4=&#39;20 MeV.&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using relativistic physics. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent OGgc:
For a two-body decay from rest, energies are E1=(M^2+m1^2−m2^2)c^2/(2M). Here M c^2=300 GeV, m1 c^2=0.66·300=198 GeV, m2 c^2=99 GeV. Compute (300^2+198^2−99^2)=119403, divide by 2·300=600 gives E1=199.005 GeV. Then T1=E1−m1 c^2=199.005−198=1.005 GeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent OGgc:
T1 ≈ 1.005 GeV

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the rest masses of the two fragments based on the given conditions. The sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M, and one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent IapJ:
Let m_small = x, m_large = 2x. Given x + 2x = 0.99 M ⇒ 3x = 0.99 M ⇒ x = 0.33 M. Thus m_small = 0.33 M and m_large = 0.66 M.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent IapJ:
m_small = 0.33 M; m_large = 0.66 M

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 2 and sub-task 3, calculate the difference between the kinetic energy values. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent cb14:
Using T1_rel ≈ 1.005 GeV and T1_class ≈ 1.000 GeV gives ΔT ≈ 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

### thinking by Debate Agent cqwK:
The relativistic T1 ≈1.005 GeV and classical T1 ≈1.000 GeV differ by ΔT≈0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

### thinking by Debate Agent M7qy:
The relativistic kinetic energy T1≈1.005 GeV and classical T1≈1.000 GeV differ by ΔT≈0.005 GeV = 5 MeV, corresponding to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent xZl4:
The relativistic kinetic energy T1≈1.005 GeV and classical estimate T1≈1.000 GeV differ by ΔT≈0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

### answer by Debate Agent cb14:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent cqwK:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent M7qy:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent xZl4:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 2 and sub-task 3, calculate the difference between the kinetic energy values.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
