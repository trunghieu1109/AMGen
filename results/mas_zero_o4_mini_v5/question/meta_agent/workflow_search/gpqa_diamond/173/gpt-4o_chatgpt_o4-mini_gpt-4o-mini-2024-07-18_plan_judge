Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 173_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Sub-task 2 gave T1_rel≈1.005 GeV and sub-task 3 gave T1_cl≈1.000 GeV, so ΔT≈0.005 GeV=5 MeV, which corresponds to choice B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
