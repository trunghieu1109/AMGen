    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.&#39;, choice1=&#39;29&#39;, choice2=&#39;25&#39;, choice3=&#39;35&#39;, choice4=&#39;31&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify Substance X and determine its constituent elements, focusing on the heavier isotope and its role in reactions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent PrfT:
The reactions described match those of a deuteride reagent analogous to LiAlH4. Gas W (D2) has equal protons and neutrons; precipitate Al(OD)3 yields D2O (melting point ~277 K). The organic reagent and its analog are LiAlD4/LiAlH4.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent PrfT:
Substance X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4), containing lithium, aluminum, and the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium, which acts as the deuteride donor in reductions.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, analyze the reaction between Substance X and liquid Y, focusing on the release of gas W and formation of precipitate G. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent tAo0:
Given LiAlD4 (X) and liquid Y being D2O, the deuteride reduces water, liberating D2 gas (W) and precipitating Al(OD)3 (G), with LiOD in solution. Upon heating, G releases D2O. Stoichiometry: LiAlD4 + 3 D2O → Al(OD)3↓ + LiOD + 3 D2.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent tAo0:
LiAlD4 + 3 D₂O → Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + LiOD + 3 D₂ (gas W); gas W is deuterium (D₂), and precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the properties of gas W, focusing on the number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent anH1:
Gas W was identified as D₂ based on sub-task 2; each deuterium nucleus has one proton and one neutron, so a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

### answer by Final Decision Agent anH1:
Gas W (D₂) contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, investigate the properties of precipitate G and its decomposition to release B, including determining the melting point of B. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YoIH:
The precipitate G formed from LiAlD4 and D2O is Al(OD)3. Upon heating, aluminum deuteroxide dehydrates, releasing heavy water (D2O). The known melting point of D2O under standard conditions is about 277 K.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YoIH:
Precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). When heated it decomposes to release heavy water (D₂O), which has a melting point of approximately 277 K.

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, analyze the reaction of a keto acid with Substance X to determine the resulting product containing 2 atoms of oxygen. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent cnqB:
Reduction of a keto acid (e.g. pyruvic acid) by LiAlD₄ converts the keto group to a secondary alcohol and the carboxyl group to a primary alcohol, yielding a diol with two oxygen atoms.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent cnqB:
1,2-propanediol

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Based on the output of sub-task 5, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X, considering all isotopes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Substance X is LiAlD₄, containing 4 deuterium atoms (mass ≈2 each) and 1 Al atom (mass ≈27). Cumulative masses: 4×2=8 for deuterium (lightest) + 27 for aluminum (heaviest) = 35.
