proposed answer: The proposed 7-step sequence (nitration → reduction → Friedel–Crafts acylation → bromination → second nitration → diazotization → hydrodeamination) is chemically sound but leads to cumulative deactivation of the aromatic ring, causing later electrophilic steps to suffer low conversions. Estimated yields per step give an overall yield of ~10–20%. Careful control of regioselectivity and reaction conditions is required to minimize side products.

Answer:Feasible but low overall yield (~10–20%) due to cumulative deactivation and side reactions; requires careful control of regioselectivity and reaction conditions.

proposed answer: Nitration first installs a strong deactivator, making the ring much less reactive toward subsequent Friedel–Crafts acylation and electrophilic bromination. Although each step is chemically feasible, the strongly deactivating nitro group introduced initially will significantly lower the overall yields.

Answer:The sequence is technically feasible but will suffer from very low overall yields due to ring deactivation by the nitro group before Friedel–Crafts acylation and bromination.
