Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 45_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Sub-task 1 identifies olefin metathesis. Sub-task 2 details Ru-catalyzed self-metathesis forming internal dimer R–CH=CH–R with E and Z isomers, each giving three stereoisomers (R,R), (S,S), and meso. Total = 3 + 3 = 6.

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 45_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene self-metathesis yields a symmetric decene (3,7-dimethyldec-4-ene) plus ethene. The decene has one C=C (E/Z) and two equivalent chiral centers (2^2 stereocenters) but symmetry gives for each geometry one meso plus an enantiomeric pair: 3 isomers per E or Z, totalling 6 distinct products (excluding ethene).
