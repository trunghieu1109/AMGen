    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;6&#39;, choice3=&#39;8&#39;, choice4=&#39;2&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the type of reaction that occurs when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent MasV:
Grubbs catalysts are well‚Äêknown for mediating the redistribution of alkene fragments via cleavage and reformation of C=C bonds, i.e., olefin metathesis.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent MasV:
Olefin metathesis

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of Sub-task 1, determine the possible intermediate steps and products formed. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9Uxz:
Enumerating all metathesis products from rac-3-methylpent-1-ene requires knowing whether only self-metathesis occurs or if a cross-partner is present, as well as catalyst loading and concentration. Without this, one can only outline the general catalytic cycle and the simplest products.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9Uxz:
The reaction proceeds via (1) formation of a Ru-alkylidene active species, (2) [2+2] cycloaddition to give a metallacyclobutane intermediate, and (3) cycloreversion to release ethene plus the C10 head-to-head dimer; possible alkene isomerization may also occur
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify whether only self-metathesis is intended or if a cross-metathesis partner and the reaction conditions (e.g. concentration, temperature, catalyst loading) are provided to predict the full product spectrum.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of Sub-task 1 and 2, calculate the number of possible unique products (excluding ethene).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene self-metathesis yields a symmetric decene (3,7-dimethyldec-4-ene) plus ethene. The decene has one C=C (E/Z) and two equivalent chiral centers (2^2 stereocenters) but symmetry gives for each geometry one meso plus an enantiomeric pair: 3 isomers per E or Z, totalling 6 distinct products (excluding ethene).
