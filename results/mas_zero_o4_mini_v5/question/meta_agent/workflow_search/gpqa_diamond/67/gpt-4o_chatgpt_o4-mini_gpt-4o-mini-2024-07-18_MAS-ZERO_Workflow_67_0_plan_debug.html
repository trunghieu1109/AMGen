    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?&#39;, choice1=&#39;gamma*B/2&#39;, choice2=&#39;gamma*B&#39;, choice3=&#39;gamma*B/sqrt(2)&#39;, choice4=&#39;sqrt(2)*gamma*B&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Describe the initial conditions of the particle&#39;s magnetic moment and the magnetic field before it changes direction. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent FvzT:
The question asks for initial conditions which are clearly stated: the particle’s spin is aligned with the initial B-field along +Z.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent FvzT:
Initially, the particle’s magnetic moment is aligned along the +Z direction (spin‐up eigenstate of Sz), and the magnetic field is uniform with magnitude B pointing along the +Z axis.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, analyze how the change in magnetic field direction affects the particle&#39;s magnetic moment. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent It30:
The spin is initially in the +Z eigenstate. When the field is switched to +Y, that +Z state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. It becomes a superposition of +Y and –Y eigenstates, so under the new H=−γB Sy the state rotates (precesses) about the Y axis. This causes the expectation value of the magnetic moment’s Z component to oscillate in time.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent It30:
The magnetic moment begins to precess about the new +Y axis because the initial +Z‐aligned state is a superposition of Sy eigenstates. As a result, its Z component oscillates sinusoidally at the Larmor frequency ω=γB.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, calculate the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
