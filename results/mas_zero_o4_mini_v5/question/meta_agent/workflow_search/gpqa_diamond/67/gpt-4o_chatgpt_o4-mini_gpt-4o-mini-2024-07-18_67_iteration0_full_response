When the field is switched to +Y, that +Z state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. It becomes a superposition of +Y and –Y eigenstates, so under the new H=−γB\u2009Sy the state rotates (precesses) about the Y axis. This causes the expectation value of the magnetic moment’s Z component to oscillate in time.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent It30:\nThe magnetic moment begins to precess about the new +Y axis because the initial +Z‐aligned state is a superposition of Sy eigenstates. As a result, its Z component oscillates sinusoidally at the Larmor frequency ω=γB.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, calculate the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent FvzT, on the purpose of understanding initial setup, thinking: The question asks for initial conditions which are clearly stated: the particle’s spin is aligned with the initial B-field along +Z.; answer: Initially, the particle’s magnetic moment is aligned along the +Z direction (spin‐up eigenstate of Sz), and the magnetic field is uniform with magnitude B pointing along the +Z axis.\nCoT agent It30, on the purpose of analyzing change in magnetic field, thinking: The spin is initially in the +Z eigenstate.
