Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 193_Iteration_0
proposed answer: There are 2 fully aligned states with E=−3J giving weight e^{3βJ}, and 6 mixed states with E=+J giving weight e^{−βJ}. Summing these yields the partition function.

Answer:Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{−βJ}
Extracted answer: Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{−βJ}
Correct answer: 0

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 193_Iteration_0
proposed answer: There are 2 states with E = -3J giving Boltzmann factor e^{3Jβ}, and 6 states with E = J giving e^{-Jβ}. Summing yields Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}.
