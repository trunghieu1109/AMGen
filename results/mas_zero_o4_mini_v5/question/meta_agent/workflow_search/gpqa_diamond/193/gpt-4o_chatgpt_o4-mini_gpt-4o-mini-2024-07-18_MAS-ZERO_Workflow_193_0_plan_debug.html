Example(question=&#39;Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)&#39;, choice1=&#39;Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)&#39;, choice2=&#39;Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)&#39;, choice3=&#39;Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)&#39;, choice4=&#39;Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)&#39;, correct_index=0).

 ### thinking by Debate Agent LFK6:
Two fully aligned states with E=−3J give factor e^{3Jβ}, and six mixed states with E=J give factor e^{−Jβ}. Summing yields Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}, which matches choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent 14d3:
There are 2 fully aligned states with energy E=−3J giving factor e^{3Jβ}, and 6 mixed states with energy E=J giving factor e^{−Jβ}. Summing these contributions yields Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}, which corresponds to choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent bO5F:
Two fully aligned states have energy -3J giving factor e^{3Jβ}, and six mixed states have energy J giving factor e^{-Jβ}. Summing yields Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ}, matching choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent zu45:
Count 2 states with E = -3J → factor e^{3Jβ}, and 6 states with E = J → factor e^{-Jβ}. Summing gives Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, sum the Boltzmann factors to find the partition function Z.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
