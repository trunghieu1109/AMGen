Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 9_Iteration_0
proposed answer: All sub-tasks yield densities: (a) ≈5.51 g/cm³, others ≈5.5 g/cm³. Thus option (a) has the highest density.
