Question: Example(question='A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', choice1='5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice2='3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice3='2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', choice4='2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Numbering the ring with the carboxylic acid as C-1 and applying the rule of lowest set of locants by alphabetical consideration (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) gives cyano at C-3 rather than C-5. That yields C-2=hydroxy, C-3=cyano, C-4=methoxy, C-5=formyl, C-6=dimethylamino. Alphabetical listing of substituents with locants gives 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which is choice B).
