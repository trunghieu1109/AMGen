Example(question=&#39;Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.&#39;, choice1=&#39;3&lt;5&lt;1&lt;6&lt;2&lt;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39;, choice3=&#39;6&lt;2&lt;4&lt;5&lt;1&lt;3&#39;, choice4=&#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2, arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Jyp6:
Meta-directing groups (COOH, COOR, NO2) yield the lowest para fraction; weak activators (C2H5, CH3) give higher; halogen (Cl) gives the highest, matching the sequence 6&lt;2&lt;4&lt;5&lt;1&lt;3.

### thinking by Debate Agent KNrN:
Meta‐directing substituents (–COOH, –COOR, –NO2) give the lowest para yield, followed by activators alkyl (C2H5, CH3) and then halogen (Cl) gives the highest. Hence the order is 6&lt;2&lt;4&lt;5&lt;1&lt;3, corresponding to choice C.

### thinking by Debate Agent IKHp:
Meta‐directors (COOH, COOR, NO2) give the lowest para yields, followed by halogen deactivator Cl, then activating alkyls; thus 6&lt;2&lt;4&lt;5&lt;1&lt;3 corresponds to choice C).

### answer by Debate Agent Jyp6:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent KNrN:
C)

### answer by Debate Agent IKHp:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2, arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
