Question: Example(question='Identify the starting material, A, in the following reaction.\nA + a methyleneruthenium compound + 1-propene ---> 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane', choice1='2-methyl-3-methylenebicyclo[2.1.0]pentane', choice2='bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-6-ene', choice3='1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane', choice4='2-methylbicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The product arises from cross‚Äêmetathesis of two exocyclic methylene groups on a cyclopentane ring. Only 1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane has the required adjacent exocyclic =CH2 groups on a cyclopentane core; the other choices are bicyclic or lack the correct ring.
