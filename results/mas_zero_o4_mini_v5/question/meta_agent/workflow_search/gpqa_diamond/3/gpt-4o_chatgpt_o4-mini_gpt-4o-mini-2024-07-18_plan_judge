Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles Gauss’s law for magnetism acquires a magnetic charge density term ∇·B=μ₀ρ_m and Faraday’s law acquires a magnetic current term ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−μ₀J_m, so only the divergence of B and the circulation of E equations are modified.
