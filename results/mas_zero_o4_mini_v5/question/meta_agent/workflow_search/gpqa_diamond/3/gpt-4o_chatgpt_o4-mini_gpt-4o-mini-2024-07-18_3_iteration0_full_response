The relevant equations are Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction (curl of B).; answer: The divergence equation (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and the curl equation (Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s addition).\nCoT agent TwPR, Sub-task 2, thinking: Sub-task 1 identified Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B).

That directly alters Gauss’s law for magnetism (the divergence equation for B), making ∇·B=ρ_m instead of zero. The curl‐of‐B equation (Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s addition) remains unchanged in its coupling to electric currents and displacement current; monopoles only modify the dual equation for ∇×E.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B=ρ_m.
