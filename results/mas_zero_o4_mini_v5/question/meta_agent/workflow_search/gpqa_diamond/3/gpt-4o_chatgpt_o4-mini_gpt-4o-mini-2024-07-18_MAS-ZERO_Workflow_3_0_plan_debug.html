    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, choice1=&#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, choice2=&#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, choice3=&#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, choice4=&#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine how the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect these Maxwell&#39;s equations. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent TwPR:
Sub-task 1 identified Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B). Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a source term to the former but does not alter the latter, which couples B only to electric currents and displacement current.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent TwPR:
The divergence equation becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (magnetic charge density); the curl equation remains ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, match the modified equations to the provided choices and determine the correct option. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent eJow (yourself):
Sub-task 2 shows only the Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) is modified by adding μ₀ρm, while the Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B) remains unchanged. Thus only the divergence-of-B equation differs.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent eJow (yourself):
A)

### Sub-task 3: Review the answer above and criticize on where it might be wrong. If absolutely correct, output &#39;True&#39; in &#39;correct&#39;. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent xVo6:
The answer is incorrect. In a theory with magnetic monopoles both Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (the curl of E) acquire additional source terms. The original answer only modified ∇·B and ignored the change to the circulation of the electric field due to magnetic current.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, match the modified equations to the provided choices and determine the correct option.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>In the presence of magnetic monopoles Gauss’s law for magnetism acquires a magnetic charge density term ∇·B=μ₀ρ_m and Faraday’s law acquires a magnetic current term ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−μ₀J_m, so only the divergence of B and the circulation of E equations are modified.
