    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?&#39;, choice1=&#39;8&#39;, choice2=&#39;6&#39;, choice3=&#39;7&#39;, choice4=&#39;10&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, determine the structure of product 4 after treatment with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZiIa:
Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild hydride donor that does not reduce simple vinyl chlorides or alkenes, so product 3 remains unchanged.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZiIa:
1-chlorocyclohexene

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
