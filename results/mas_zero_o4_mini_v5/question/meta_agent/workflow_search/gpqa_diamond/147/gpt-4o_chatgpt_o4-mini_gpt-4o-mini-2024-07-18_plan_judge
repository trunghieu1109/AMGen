Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 147_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Assuming Y = Sb (121.76 g/mol) and A4 = SbF₃ gives M ≈121.76 + 3×19.00 = 178.76 g/mol, which falls within the 160–180 g/mol range.
