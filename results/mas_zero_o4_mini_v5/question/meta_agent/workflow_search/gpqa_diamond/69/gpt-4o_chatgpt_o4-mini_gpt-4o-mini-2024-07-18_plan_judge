Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 69_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The sub-task 2 outputs did not provide explicit structural data for E. All agents speculated that E is N2O4 with a planar gauche geometry, which corresponds to the C2v point group. Without the molecular formula or connectivity, this assignment remains a best guess.

Answer:C2v
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the molecular formula or explicit structural connectivity of product E to confirm its geometry and symmetry.
Extracted answer: C2v
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: All sub-task analyses consistently identify product E (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide) in its lowest-energy conformation as having a two-fold rotation axis through the sulfur and two perpendicular mirror planes, which corresponds to point group C2v.
