Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 172_Iteration_0
proposed answer: We use the non‐relativistic formula ΔE = (Δp)²/(2m). With Δp = 5.27×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s and m = 9.11×10⁻³¹ kg, we get ΔE = (5.27e-25)²/(2×9.11e-31) ≈ 1.5×10⁻¹⁹ J.

Answer:ΔE ≈ 1.5 × 10^(-19) J
Extracted answer: ΔE ≈ 1.5 × 10^(-19) J
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 172_Iteration_0
proposed answer: To propagate uncertainty for E=p²/(2m), use dE/dp = p/m = v, so ΔE ≃ v·Δp = (2×10⁸ m/s)(5.3×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≃1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J.

Answer:≈1.06×10^-16 J
Extracted answer: ≈1.06×10^-16 J
Correct answer: 2
