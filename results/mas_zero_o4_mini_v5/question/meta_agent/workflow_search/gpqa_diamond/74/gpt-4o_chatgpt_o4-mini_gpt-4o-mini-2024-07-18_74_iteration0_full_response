Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=1)

While GADD45G’s general functions in stress signaling, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis are well described, direct evidence of its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. Without specific experimental or literature data on how SARS-CoV-2 modulates GADD45G or vice versa, any answer must remain tentative and would benefit from additional data.; answer: GADD45G is a stress‐induced regulatory protein that interfaces with MAPK signaling pathways to mediate cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. In the context of viral infections, GADD45G can modulate innate immune responses, potentially influencing the balance between antiviral defense and immunopathology. For SARS‐CoV‐2 specifically, it may be upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines (like IL-2) and could affect the fate of infected epithelial or immune cells, thereby impacting viral replication and host tissue damage.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide data on GADD45G expression changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection or any known interactions between GADD45G and viral or host proteins to refine this analysis.\nCoT-SC agent wHTj, on the purpose of sequence analysis, thinking: I scanned the provided coding sequence in the primary reading frame. Immediately after the HA tag coding region (YPYDVPDYA), there is a TGA codon (stop) in frame, which would terminate translation prematurely before the GADD45G coding sequence.; answer: The sequence contains an in-frame TGA stop codon right after the HA tag, causing early termination of translation.\nCoT-SC agent bMbc, on the purpose of sequence analysis, thinking: I translated the N-terminal HA tag sequence and found that immediately after the epitope the codon TGA appears in-frame, which is a stop codon. This would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely and prevent expression of the full-length recombinant protein.; answer: The N-terminal HA tag sequence introduces an in-frame stop codon (TGA) immediately after the epitope, causing premature translation termination.\nCoT-SC agent nOed, on the purpose of sequence analysis, thinking: The sequence translates the HA tag correctly but contains an in-frame TGA codon at nucleotides 34–36 (right after the tag), which is a stop codon. This would cause premature termination of translation and prevent full-length protein expression.; answer: The sequence contains an in-frame TGA stop codon shortly after the HA tag, causing early translation termination.\nDebate agent mqRp, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sub-task 2 identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature translation termination and preventing full-length protein expression.; answer: B)\nDebate agent q69j, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: The sequence analysis revealed an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature termination of translation and preventing full-length protein expression.; answer: B)\nDebate agent 3IcK, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sub-task 2 identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, which would cause premature termination of translation and prevent full-length protein overexpression.; answer: B)\nDebate agent NcUY, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sub‐task 2 clearly identified an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, which would terminate translation before GADD45G is synthesized. This single nucleotide change fully explains the failure to overexpress the fusion protein. Other factors (linker absence, codon usage, promoter activity) are less likely primary causes given the presence of a stop codon in the coding sequence.; answer: The premature in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag terminates translation early, preventing full‐length protein expression.\nDebate agent mqRp, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sub-task 2 identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature termination of translation and preventing full-length protein expression.; answer: B)\nDebate agent q69j, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sequence analysis identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature translation termination and lack of full-length protein expression.; answer: B)\nDebate agent 3IcK, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sub-task 2 identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, which would cause premature termination of translation and prevent full-length protein overexpression.; answer: B)\nDebate agent NcUY, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating reasons, thinking: Sub-task 2 identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature termination of translation and preventing full-length protein expression.
