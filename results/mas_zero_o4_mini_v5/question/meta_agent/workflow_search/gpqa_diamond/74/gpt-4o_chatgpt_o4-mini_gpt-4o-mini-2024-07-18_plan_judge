Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Integrated insights from sub-task 1 (GADD45G’s cytotoxic stress/apoptotic potential) and sub-task 2 (in-frame UAA stop codon causing premature termination and NMD) to compile a comprehensive list of molecular and cellular factors that could suppress detectable protein levels.

Answer:Possible reasons for the lack of protein overexpression:
1) Premature translation termination due to an in-frame UAA stop codon immediately downstream of the HA tag, producing a truncated peptide.
2) Nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA triggered by the premature stop codon, leading to reduced transcript abundance.
3) Cytotoxic effects of even low-level GADD45G expression (activation of p38/JNK-mediated stress and apoptotic pathways), resulting in negative selection against high-expressing clones.
4) Suboptimal Kozak consensus sequence around the start codon, decreasing translation initiation efficiency in CHO cells.
5) Lack of a flexible linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, causing misfolding of the fusion protein and rapid proteolytic degradation by cellular quality-control mechanisms.
6) mRNA instability or reduced translational efficiency due to stable secondary structures, cryptic splice sites, or rare codon usage in the engineered region.

proposed answer: Sequence analysis from sub-tasks 1 and 2 identified an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to premature termination of translation and preventing full-length protein expression.
