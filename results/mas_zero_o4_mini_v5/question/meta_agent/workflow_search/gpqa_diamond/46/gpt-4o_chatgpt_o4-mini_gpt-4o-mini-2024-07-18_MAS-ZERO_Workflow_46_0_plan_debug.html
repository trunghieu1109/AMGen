### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, correlate the identified functional groups and hydrogen environments with the given choices to determine the most likely compound. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:
IR shows N–H stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ester carbonyl). 1H NMR shows an ethyl group (1.20 ppm t, 3H; 4.5 ppm q, 2H), a broad NH₂ singlet (4.0 ppm, 2H), and two aromatic doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H) indicative of a para‐disubstituted benzene. Only ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits these features.

### thinking by Debate Agent z26p:
The IR indicates NH2 stretches and an ester C=O. The 1H NMR shows an ethyl group (t at 1.20 ppm, q at 4.5 ppm), a broad NH2 singlet at 4.0 ppm, and two aromatic doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) consistent with a para‐disubstituted benzene bearing an amino and an ethyl ester substituent. Only ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits all data.

### thinking by Debate Agent I2Kk:
IR absorptions at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ indicate an NH2 group and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to an ester carbonyl. 1H NMR shows an ethyl group (1.20 ppm, t, 3H and 4.5 ppm, q, 2H), a broad NH2 singlet (4.0 ppm, 2H), and two aromatic doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene bearing an amino and an ethyl ester substituent, matching ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

### thinking by Debate Agent p9s1:
The IR shows NH2 stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹; the NMR shows an ethyl group (1.20 ppm t, 4.5 ppm q), NH2 protons (4.0 ppm bs, 2H), and a para‐disubstituted aromatic pattern (7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each d, 2H), consistent only with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, correlate the identified functional groups and hydrogen environments with the given choices to determine the most likely compound.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The IR shows NH2 stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and an ester C=O stretch (1720 cm⁻¹). The 1H NMR exhibits an ethyl group (1.20 ppm triplet, 4.5 ppm quartet), a broad NH2 singlet (4.0 ppm, 2H), and two aromatic doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each 2H) indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene with amino and ethyl ester substituents. This matches ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
