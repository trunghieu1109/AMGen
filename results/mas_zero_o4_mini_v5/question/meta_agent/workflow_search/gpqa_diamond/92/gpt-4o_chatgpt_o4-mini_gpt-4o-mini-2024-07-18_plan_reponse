This imprecision reflects user/technical error rather than an inherent flaw in qPCR. When technical variability is minimized via optimized pipetting and reaction setup, qPCR remains a gold-standard method for nucleic acid quantification.\n\nAnswer:qPCR remains a gold\u2010standard quantitative technique in principle, but the current run\u2019s replicate Ct variability (>0.3 cycles) undermines its quantitative accuracy; improvements in technical precision (pipetting, assay setup, replicate consistency) are required before reliable quantification can be achieved.",
