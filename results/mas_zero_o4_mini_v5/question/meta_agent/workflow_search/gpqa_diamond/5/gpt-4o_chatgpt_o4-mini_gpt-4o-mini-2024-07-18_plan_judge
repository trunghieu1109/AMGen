proposed answer: Both debate agents agree that the effective motion separates into two independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m), hence the total energy is the sum (n_x+½)ħω_x+(n_y+½)ħω_y, which simplifies to ħ√(k/m)(2n_x+n_y+3/2).

Answer:E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)
Extracted answer: E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)
Correct answer: 0

proposed answer: The debates agree that the potential corresponds to an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m), yielding E=(n_x+½)ħω_x+(n_y+½)ħω_y = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ħ√(k/m), matching choice A).
