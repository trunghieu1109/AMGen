Example(question=&#39;Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?&#39;, choice1=&#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10&#39;, choice2=&#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3&#39;, choice3=&#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10&#39;, choice4=&#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the energy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator using the formula E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \hbar \omega (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Identify the quantum numbers for the third excited state. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent DGcJ:
The third excited state corresponds to total quantum number N=n_x+n_y+n_z=3. Using E=ħω(N+3/2) gives E=(3+3/2)ħω=(9/2)ħω. The quantum numbers are all nonnegative triples summing to 3.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent DGcJ:
E = (9/2) ħω; (n_x,n_y,n_z) = (3,0,0),(0,3,0),(0,0,3),(2,1,0),(2,0,1),(1,2,0),(0,2,1),(1,0,2),(0,1,2),(1,1,1)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, determine the degeneracy of the third excited state by counting the number of permutations of quantum numbers that yield the same energy.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The third excited state corresponds to N=3 with nonnegative (n_x,n_y,n_z) summing to 3. There are 10 such permutations listed, so the degeneracy is 10.
