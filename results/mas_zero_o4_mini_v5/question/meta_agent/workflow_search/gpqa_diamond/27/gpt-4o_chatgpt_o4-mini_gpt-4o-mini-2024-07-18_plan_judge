Question: Example(question='S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice2='(2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice3="(1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol", choice4='(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Acidic HCl cleaves the TBS ether to give the free 4‚ÄêOH, retaining the stereochemical assignments established in earlier steps: C2 (benzyl) S, C3 (phenyl) R, C4 (OH) S and the C6 methyl is installed with S configuration. This matches choice A.
