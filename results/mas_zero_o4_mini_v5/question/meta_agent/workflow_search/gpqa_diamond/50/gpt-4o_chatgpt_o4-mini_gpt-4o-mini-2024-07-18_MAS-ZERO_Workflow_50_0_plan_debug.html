Example(question=&#39;If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.&#39;, choice1=&#39;U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, choice2=&#39;U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, choice3=&#39;U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)&#39;, choice4=&#39;U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the image charge induced inside the sphere due to the external charge q using the method of images. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vr9h:
To find the image charge for a grounded conducting sphere of radius R with an external charge q at distance d, one uses the method of images ensuring the sphere’s surface is an equipotential (zero). The classic result is an induced image charge q&#39;=−(R/d)q placed at r&#39;=R^2/d from the center along the line to the real charge.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vr9h:
The image charge is q′ = -q·R/d located at a distance R^2/d from the center along the line toward the external charge.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the interaction energy between the external charge q and the induced image charge. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1pvS:
The image charge q&#39; = -qR/d is at distance R^2/d. The distance between the real and image charges is d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d. The interaction energy is U = k*q*q&#39;/(separation) = k*q*(-qR/d)/((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k*q^2*R/(d^2 - R^2).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1pvS:
U = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the net potential energy of the system, considering the grounded nature of the sphere.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>For a grounded conducting sphere, the net potential energy is half the interaction energy with the image charge (since the sphere is grounded), giving U = (1/2)·(-k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)).

Answer:U = -(1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)</pre>
