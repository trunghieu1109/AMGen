Thus Br at C-5 is replaced by OH, yielding the tertiary alcohol.; answer: 5-hydroxy-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene\nCoT-SC agent 9rQA, on the purpose of identifying product B, thinking: PDC selectively oxidizes primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyls but generally does not oxidize tertiary alcohols due to lack of a proton on the carbon bearing the OH. The substrate is a tertiary alcohol, so no oxidation occurs. Therefore B remains the same tertiary alcohol as A.; answer: 5-hydroxy-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene\nCoT-SC agent 2Mz6, on the purpose of identifying product B, thinking: PDC (pyridinium dichromate) oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones but does not affect tertiary alcohols. The OH at C-5 in A is secondary (attached to two ring carbons and one hydrogen), so PDC converts it into the corresponding ketone at C-5.; answer: 5-oxo-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene\nCoT-SC agent 0EAz, on the purpose of identifying product B, thinking: PDC oxidizes the secondary alcohol at C-5 to the corresponding ketone.
