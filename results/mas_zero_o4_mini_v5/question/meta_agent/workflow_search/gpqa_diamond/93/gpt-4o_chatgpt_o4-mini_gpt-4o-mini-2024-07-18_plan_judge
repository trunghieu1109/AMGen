Question: Example(question='Identify the starting material(s) required to synthesize methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate.', choice1='1-vinylcyclohex-1-ene and methyl hex-2-ynoate', choice2='methyl (2E,4E,10Z)-tetradeca-2,4,10-trienoate', choice3='Cyclohexene and methyl 2,3-dimethylenehexanoate', choice4='methyl (2E,8E,10E)-tetradeca-2,8,10-trienoate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 93_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Given the retrosynthetic analysis indicating a Dielsâ€“Alder between cyclohexene and methyl 2,3-dimethylenehexanoate as the most direct route to the target, choice 3 (C) is clearly the best match.
