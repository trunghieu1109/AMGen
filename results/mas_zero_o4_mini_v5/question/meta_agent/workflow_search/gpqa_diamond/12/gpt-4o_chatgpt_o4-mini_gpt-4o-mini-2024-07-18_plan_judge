Question: Example(question='A methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene is stirred with Pd/C under a Hydrogen atmosphere. After 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product.\n\n1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, forming product 2.\n\nProduct 2 is treated with sodium methoxide, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. and a catalytic amount of  4-dimethylaminopyridine, forming product 4.\n\nwhat is a valid structure of product 4? (product 4 exists as a mixture of isomers. the correct answer is one of them).', choice1='(1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate', choice2='(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate', choice3='1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate', choice4='(1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate', correct_index=1)
