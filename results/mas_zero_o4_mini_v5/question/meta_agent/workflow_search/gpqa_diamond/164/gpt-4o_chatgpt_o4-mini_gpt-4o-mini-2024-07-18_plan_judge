proposed answer: Noble‐metal (Pd, Rh) chain‐walking catalysts can indeed produce regularly branched polyethylene from ethylene alone, but all literature and economic data indicate their turnover numbers and lifetimes are far lower than conventional catalysts, while precious‐metal salts and designer ligands cost tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram. This drives catalyst costs per ton of polymer into the hundreds or thousands of dollars, versus <$10 per ton for industry‐standard systems, making them technically feasible at lab scale but commercially unviable for large‐scale HDPE/LLDPE production.

Answer:Noble‐metal catalysts (e.g. Pd or Rh chain‐walking complexes) are technically capable of introducing regular branches into polyethylene using only ethylene, but their very low productivity, limited stability, and extremely high raw material and ligand costs result in catalyst expenses (hundreds to thousands of dollars per ton of polymer) that far exceed the $1–$10 per ton cost of conventional Ziegler–Natta or metallocene catalysts, rendering them economically prohibitive for industrial use.

proposed answer: I reviewed the technical literature and various expert analyses on using noble metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, Rh) for chain-walking ethylene polymerization. These catalysts can indeed introduce regular branches in polyethylene, but their inherent high metal cost, low natural abundance, need for sophisticated ligands and activators, modest turnover numbers, and challenging recovery/recycling all drive up capital and operating expenses. Compared to cheaper early- or mid-transition-metal systems, they are industrially noncompetitive.

Answer:Noble‐metal catalysts (e.g. Pd, Pt, Rh) can perform chain-walking ethylene polymerization to generate regularly branched polyethylene, but their high raw‐material cost, complex ligand/activator requirements, lower turnover numbers, and expensive recovery and recycling steps render them economically unviable for large-scale commodity polymer production.
