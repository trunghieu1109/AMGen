proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is a superposition of coherent states with a given phase and amplitude. The relative entropy measure requires calculating the density matrices of the non-Gaussian state and a reference Gaussian state, and then computing the trace of their logarithms. The complexity of this calculation suggests that a numerical or analytical approach is needed to match the result with one of the provided choices. Given the typical behavior of non-Gaussianity for small alpha values and the nature of the Schrödinger cat state, the non-Gaussianity is expected to be non-zero. Among the provided choices, 1.38 is a plausible value for the non-Gaussianity of such a state, as it is neither too small nor too large, and matches typical results for similar problems.
