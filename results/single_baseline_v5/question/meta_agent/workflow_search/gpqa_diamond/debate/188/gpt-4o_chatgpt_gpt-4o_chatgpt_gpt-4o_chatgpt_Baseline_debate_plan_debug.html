### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electrons&#39; spin structures in a crystal lattice, often related to broken spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can occur in magnetic systems, often related to broken symmetries in magnetic textures. A pion is a meson that emerges from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, associated with lattice vibrations rather than a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. Magnons are quanta of spin waves and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnets. Skyrmions are topological solitons and are associated with certain types of spontaneously broken symmetries in field theories. Pions are Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others, as they arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations rather than symmetry breaking.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
To determine which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let&#39;s analyze each option. Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a lattice and arise due to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons that can appear in magnetic systems and are related to broken symmetries in certain field theories. Pions are mesons that emerge as a result of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quantized modes of vibrations in a crystal lattice and are not directly related to spontaneously-broken symmetry but rather to lattice vibrations. Therefore, the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
To determine which of the listed particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let&#39;s consider each option: A) Magnon: Magnons are associated with spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry in ferromagnets. B) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons and not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, but rather with topological stability. C) Pion: Pions are associated with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. D) Phonon: Phonons are quasiparticles that arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations and are not directly related to a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is likely the phonon.

    <pre>All agents agree that magnons, skyrmions, and pions are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons are related to broken spin rotational symmetry, skyrmions are related to certain broken symmetries in field theories, and pions are Goldstone bosons from the breaking of chiral symmetry. Phonons, however, are quantized lattice vibrations and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.
