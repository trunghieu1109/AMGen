Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that magnons, skyrmions, and pions are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons are related to broken spin rotational symmetry, skyrmions are related to certain broken symmetries in field theories, and pions are Goldstone bosons from the breaking of chiral symmetry. Phonons, however, are quantized lattice vibrations and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.
