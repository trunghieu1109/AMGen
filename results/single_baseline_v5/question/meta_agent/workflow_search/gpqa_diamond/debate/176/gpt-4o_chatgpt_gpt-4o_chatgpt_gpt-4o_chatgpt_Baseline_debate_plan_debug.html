    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is the luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s Law. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, its luminosity will be affected by the square of the radius ratio: L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² = 1.5² = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
To solve this problem, we should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity, which states that the luminosity (L) is proportional to the surface area (A) times the fourth power of the temperature (T), i.e., L = σA(T^4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature by Wien&#39;s law. The surface area of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (A ∝ R^2). Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, the ratio of their surface areas is (1.5^2):1 = 2.25:1. Since the luminosity depends on the surface area and the fourth power of the temperature, and the temperatures are the same, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s law. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 is (1.5)² = 2.25 times that of Star_2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
The luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity L is proportional to the surface area of the star and the fourth power of its temperature (L = 4πR^2σT^4). Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s Law (λ_max ∝ 1/T). Therefore, the difference in luminosity is due solely to the difference in their radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25.
