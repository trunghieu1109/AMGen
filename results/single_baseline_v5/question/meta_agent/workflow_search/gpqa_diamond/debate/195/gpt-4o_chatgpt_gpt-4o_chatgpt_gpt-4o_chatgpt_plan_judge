Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the potential energy at maximum amplitude to the relativistic energy expression. The potential energy is (1/2)kA^2, and the relativistic energy is given by E = γmc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Solving for v_max, we find that v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which matches choice B.
