Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), so plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which means it varies as (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, we have (plx)^5 = (1/r)^5 = r^-5. However, to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we need to consider the volume element in a spherical shell at distance r, which is proportional to r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r^2 * r^-5 = r^2 / r^5 = r^-3. Hence, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r^3.
