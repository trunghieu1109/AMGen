    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), so plx = 1/r. If the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, then it varies with distance as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r would vary as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which means it varies as (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, we have (plx)^5 = (1/r)^5 = r^-5. Therefore, the number of stars varies as r^-5 with parallax. However, we need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. To convert this to a function of distance, we consider the volume element in a spherical shell at distance r, which is proportional to r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r^2 * r^-5 = r^2 / r^5 = r^-3. Hence, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r^3.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which implies that the number of stars is proportional to plx^(-5). Substituting the relationship between parallax and distance, we have plx^(-5) ~ (1/r)^(-5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:
The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, giving us the relation 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5.
