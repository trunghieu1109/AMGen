    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
The problem describes a spherical conductor with a cavity inside it. A charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Due to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the conductor itself is zero, but outside the conductor, the field is due to the charge +q. By the principle of superposition, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field due to the charge +q as if it were placed at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at point P depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, which is L. The expression for the electric field due to a point charge at a distance L is given by Coulomb&#39;s law.

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. By Gauss&#39;s law, the charge induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity, leaving the outer surface of the conductor with a net charge of +q. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P, a distance L from the center of the conductor, is given by the expression for the field due to a point charge at the center. The distance l from the center of the cavity and the angle theta are irrelevant to the field at P since we&#39;re outside the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. According to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside a conductor is zero, and any excess charge resides on the surface. The conductor will redistribute its charge to cancel the field inside, but outside the conductor, it appears as if the charge is at the center. Since point P is outside the conductor, the electric field due to the charge +q inside the cavity can be considered as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to that of a point charge located at the center of the conductor with charge +q. The electric field at a distance L from a point charge is given by Coulomb&#39;s law, E = (1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)) * (q/L^2).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
The problem involves a charge inside a cavity within a conductor. By electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the conductor itself must be zero. This implies that the charge inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. However, the outer surface of the conductor will have a net charge of +q due to the charge conservation principle. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to this net charge on the outer surface, which acts like a point charge at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at a point outside the conductor is determined by the net charge +q and the distance L from the center of the conductor.
