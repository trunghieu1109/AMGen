Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. By electrostatic principles, the charge inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity, leaving the outer surface of the conductor with a net charge of +q. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P, a distance L from the center of the conductor, is given by the expression for the field due to a point charge at the center. The distance l from the center of the cavity and the angle theta are irrelevant to the field at P since we're outside the conductor. The electric field at a distance L from a point charge is given by Coulomb's law, E = (1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)) * (q/L^2).
