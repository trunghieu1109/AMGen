    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent E6Fv:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the distribution of cobalt ions among the complexes. Given the stability constants (β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16), we can determine the concentration of each complex. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We also need to find [Co2+], the free cobalt ion concentration, which can be found using the mass balance equation: c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-. Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the concentration of each species, and thus the percentage of Co(SCN)2.

### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to consider the formation of complexes with thiocyanate ions. The stability constants (β) are given for 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 complexes. The β2 value corresponds to Co(SCN)2. The fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species can be found using the formula for the fraction of a complex in solution: fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / Σ(βn * [SCN-]^n), where n ranges from 0 to 4. Calculate each term: β0 = 1 (free Co2+), β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1, β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2, β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3, β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4. Sum these values and calculate the fraction for β2. Finally, convert this fraction to a percentage.

### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the concentrations of all cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes in the solution. The given stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) correspond to the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4-2, respectively. We need to use these constants to calculate the concentrations of each complex. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4-2]) * 100%.

### thinking by Debate Agent UD2w:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the distribution of cobalt between its various complexes. The complexes formed are Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The stability constants (β) for these complexes are given, which relate to their formation equilibria. The concentration of each complex can be calculated using these constants and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The fraction of Co(SCN)2 can then be determined by dividing its concentration by the total concentration of cobalt species. The fraction is then converted to a percentage.

    <pre>All agents agree that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The stability constant β2 corresponds to Co(SCN)2, and the fraction of this complex among all cobalt species is determined by the formula: fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / Σ(βn * [SCN-]^n), where n ranges from 0 to 4. Calculating each term and summing them gives the total concentration of cobalt species. The fraction for Co(SCN)2 is then converted to a percentage. All agents have calculated this and agree on the answer being choice B).
