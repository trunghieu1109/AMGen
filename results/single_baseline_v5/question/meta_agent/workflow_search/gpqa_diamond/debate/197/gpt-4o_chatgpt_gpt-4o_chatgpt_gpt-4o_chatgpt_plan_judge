Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The stability constant β2 corresponds to Co(SCN)2, and the fraction of this complex among all cobalt species is determined by the formula: fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / Σ(βn * [SCN-]^n), where n ranges from 0 to 4. Calculating each term and summing them gives the total concentration of cobalt species. The fraction for Co(SCN)2 is then converted to a percentage. All agents have calculated this and agree on the answer being choice B).
