Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the masses of two binary star systems using Kepler's Third Law and the radial velocity method. The total mass of a binary system can be determined using the formula: M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G), where P is the period, K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes, and G is the gravitational constant. The ratio of the total masses of the systems will be proportional to (P1 * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3) / (P2 * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3), where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to systems 1 and 2, respectively. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s. Calculating the ratio: (2 * (10 + 5)^3) / (1 * (15 + 10)^3) = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3) = (2 * 3375) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. Thus, system_1 is more massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.4. Therefore, the correct answer is A).
