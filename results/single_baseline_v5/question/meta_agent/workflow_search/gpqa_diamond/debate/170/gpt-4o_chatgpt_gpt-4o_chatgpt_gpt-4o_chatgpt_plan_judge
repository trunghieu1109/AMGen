Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In electrophilic substitution reactions, the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring affects the position where the new substituent is introduced. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) activate the ring and direct new substituents to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) deactivate the ring and direct new substituents to the meta position. For the given compounds: 1) C6H5-CH3 and 5) C6H5-C2H5 are EDGs, directing to ortho/para. 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 and 6) C6H5-COOH are EWGs, directing to meta. 3) C6H5-Cl is a weak EWG but directs to ortho/para due to resonance. 4) C6H5-NO2 is a strong EWG, directing to meta. The order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3. This matches choice D.
