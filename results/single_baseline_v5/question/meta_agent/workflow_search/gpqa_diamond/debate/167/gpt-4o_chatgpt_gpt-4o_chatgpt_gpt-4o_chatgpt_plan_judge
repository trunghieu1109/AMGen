Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks for the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The issues listed are: mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. While all these issues can cause errors, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are particularly notorious for causing subtle errors that are difficult to identify. Mutually incompatible data formats are often caught early in the analysis process. Therefore, the best choice includes the issues that are more subtle and difficult to spot, which are 2, 3, and 4. Thus, the final answer is D).
