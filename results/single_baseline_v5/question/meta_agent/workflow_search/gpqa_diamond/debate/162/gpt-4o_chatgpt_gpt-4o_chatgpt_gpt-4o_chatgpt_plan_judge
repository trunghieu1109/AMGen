Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000936 mol. Since Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ per mole to dissolve, we need 0.002808 mol of H+. Using a 0.1 M acid, the volume needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume of the solution will be 100 cm3 + 28.08 cm3 = 128.08 cm3. The concentration of H+ will be 0.002808 mol / 0.12808 L = 0.02192 M, and the pH is -log(0.02192) ≈ 1.66. However, the closest match for volume and pH in the given choices is option A, which suggests a pH of 2.04 and a volume of 28.05 cm3. This indicates that the assumptions or calculations might have slight errors, but option A is the closest match.
