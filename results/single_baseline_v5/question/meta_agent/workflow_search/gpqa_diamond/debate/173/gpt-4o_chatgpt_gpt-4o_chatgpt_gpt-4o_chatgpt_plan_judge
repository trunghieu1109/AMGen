Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using relativistic and classical approximations. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, leaving 3 GeV for kinetic energy. The mass ratio of the fragments is 1:2, leading to rest-masses of 0.33M and 0.66M. The kinetic energy difference due to relativistic effects is typically small, in the MeV range. Most agents agree on a 10 MeV difference, which is reasonable given the energy scales involved. Therefore, the final answer is A).
