Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the process to find the partition function Z. We consider all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1, leading to 8 configurations. For each configuration, we calculate the energy E using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The energies are -3J for configurations (1, 1, 1) and (-1, -1, -1), and J for the other 6 configurations. The partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each configuration: Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). This matches choice A).
