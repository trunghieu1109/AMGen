Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, which is related to temperature via the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann factor, exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the population ratio is 2, we have exp(-ΔE/kT_1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/kT_2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This simplifies to ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1*T_2), which matches choice D). Therefore, the correct equation is choice D).
