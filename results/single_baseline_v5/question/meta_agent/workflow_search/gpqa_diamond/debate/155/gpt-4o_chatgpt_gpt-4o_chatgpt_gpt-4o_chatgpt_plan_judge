Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reactions involve the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening to form diols. The (E)-oct-4-ene will form a meso diol, which is achiral, while the (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a pair of enantiomeric diols, which are chiral. On a standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair will appear as 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomeric pair will be resolved into 2 separate peaks, while the meso compound remains as one peak, resulting in 3 peaks.
