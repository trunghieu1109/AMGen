Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene both produce epoxides. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, these epoxides open to form diols. The stereochemistry of the initial alkenes will affect the stereochemistry of the diols. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the resulting diol will be a meso compound due to the internal plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the resulting diol will be a pair of enantiomers, which are chiral. In a standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair will appear as 2 peaks. In a chiral HPLC, the enantiomeric pair will be resolved into 2 separate peaks, while the meso compound remains as one peak, resulting in 3 peaks.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xKiP:\nIn Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are converted to epoxides using mCPBA. The epoxide formation is stereospecific, so (E)-oct-4-ene will form a different epoxide than (Z)-oct-4-ene. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, each epoxide will undergo ring opening to form diols. The diols formed from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene will be enantiomers. Thus, we will have two sets of enantiomeric diols. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers are not resolved, so we will see two peaks corresponding to the two sets of diols. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so we will see four peaks corresponding to each diol enantiomer.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vDzD:\nIn Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide, which upon treatment with aqueous acid opens to form a trans-diol. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes a similar reaction sequence to produce a cis-diol. The trans-diol is a meso compound and hence achiral, while the cis-diol is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. On a standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair would give two peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomeric pair would be resolved into two separate peaks, leading to three peaks in total: one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent RtOd:\nReaction 1 involves the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene followed by ring-opening to give a diol. Reaction 2 involves the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene followed by ring-opening to give a different diol. The epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA is stereospecific, meaning that the stereochemistry of the alkene is retained in the epoxide. Subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide will yield different stereoisomers of the diol depending on the configuration of the starting alkene. Since (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene are stereoisomers, their reaction products will be different stereoisomers of the diol. In a standard HPLC, which does not separate stereoisomers, the products from both reactions will co-elute if they are constitutional isomers, resulting in fewer peaks. In a chiral HPLC, which can resolve stereoisomers, the different stereoisomers will be separated, resulting in more peaks. Therefore, in standard HPLC, the two diols will give 2 peaks, and in chiral HPLC, the different stereoisomers will give 3 peaks (two from one reaction and one from the other or vice versa).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xMjR:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xKiP:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vDzD:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent RtOd:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
