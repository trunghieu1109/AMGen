Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we analyze the mass dimensions of the components in the Lagrangian. The Dirac field \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} \), and thus \( \bar{\psi} \) also has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} \). The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of 2. The combination \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) involves two fermion fields, so its mass dimension is 3 (since \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \)). Consequently, the mass dimension of the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). The interaction term \( \mathcal{L}_{int} \) in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 in four-dimensional spacetime. Therefore, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) must be \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension. Since \( \kappa \) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.
