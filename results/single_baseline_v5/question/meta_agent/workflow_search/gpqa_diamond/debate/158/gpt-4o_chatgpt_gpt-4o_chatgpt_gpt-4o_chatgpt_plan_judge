Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves estimating the comoving distance of a quasar based on its redshift, which is inferred from the observed peak wavelength of 790 nm. Assuming this peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line at 121.6 nm, the redshift z is approximately 5.5. In a Lambda-CDM universe with the given parameters, a redshift of z â‰ˆ 5.5 typically corresponds to a comoving distance of around 8-9 Gpc. Most agents agree on a distance of 9 Gpc, and this is consistent with the typical distances for such redshifts in the given cosmological model.
