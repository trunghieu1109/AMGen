Question: Passage: Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women. Life expectancy was 71.96 years for men and 79.62 years for women in 2015, growing continuously since the End of Communism in Hungary (1989).
Question: How many points lower was the fertility rate in 1999 in Hungary compared to what it is now experiencing?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_16
proposed answer: The fertility rate in Hungary in 1999 was 1.28, and the current estimated fertility rate is 1.43. To find out how many points lower the 1999 rate was compared to the current rate, we subtract the 1999 rate from the current rate: 1.43 - 1.28 = 0.15. This calculation shows that the fertility rate in 1999 was 0.15 points lower than it is now. The previous evaluations confirmed this calculation as correct, and the consistency across the outputs supports this conclusion.
