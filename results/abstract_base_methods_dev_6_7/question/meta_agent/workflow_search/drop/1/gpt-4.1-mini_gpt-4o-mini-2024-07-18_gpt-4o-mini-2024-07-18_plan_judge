Question: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Chargers, the Titans flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the Kansas City Chiefs. In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood as QB Vince Young completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Roydell Williams for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game with QB Brodie Croyle completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Samie Parker. Afterwards, the Titans responded with kicker Rob Bironas managing to get a 37-yard field goal. Kansas City would take the lead prior to halftime with Croyle completing a 9-yard TD pass to FB Kris Wilson. In the third quarter, Tennessee would draw close as Bironas kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Chiefs answered with kicker John Carney getting a 36-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Titans would retake the lead with Young and Williams hooking up with each other again on a 41-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Tennessee clinched the victory with Bironas nailing a 40-yard and a 25-yard field goal. With the win, the Titans kept their playoff hopes alive at 8-6.

Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_1
proposed answer: Rob Bironas' longest field goal was 40 yards, while John Carney's only field goal was 36 yards. To determine how many yards longer Bironas' field goal was compared to Carney's, we subtract Carney's field goal distance from Bironas' field goal distance: 40 yards - 36 yards = 4 yards. This calculation is correct and confirms that Bironas' longest field goal was indeed 4 yards longer than Carney's only field goal.
