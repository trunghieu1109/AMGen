Question: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Chargers, the Titans flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the Kansas City Chiefs. In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood as QB Vince Young completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Roydell Williams for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game with QB Brodie Croyle completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Samie Parker. Afterwards, the Titans responded with kicker Rob Bironas managing to get a 37-yard field goal. Kansas City would take the lead prior to halftime with Croyle completing a 9-yard TD pass to FB Kris Wilson. In the third quarter, Tennessee would draw close as Bironas kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Chiefs answered with kicker John Carney getting a 36-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Titans would retake the lead with Young and Williams hooking up with each other again on a 41-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Tennessee clinched the victory with Bironas nailing a 40-yard and a 25-yard field goal. With the win, the Titans kept their playoff hopes alive at 8-6.
