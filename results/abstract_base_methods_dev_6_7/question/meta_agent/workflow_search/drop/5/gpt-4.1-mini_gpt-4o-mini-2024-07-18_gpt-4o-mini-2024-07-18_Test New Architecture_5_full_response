Question: Passage: For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring. On the Jets' final possession, backup rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens made his first appearance under center, but the drive ended badly when he was sacked by Montavious Stanley and Nick Greisen recovered.

The longest touchdown run is 13 yards and the shortest is 6 yards. To find out how many yards longer the longest touchdown run is than the shortest, we subtract the shortest from the longest: 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, the longest touchdown run is 7 yards longer than the shortest.\n\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BO94:\n7\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 2: Using the verified touchdown run yardages extracted in Subtask 1, identify the longest and shortest touchdown runs and calculate how many yards longer the longest run was than the shortest.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
