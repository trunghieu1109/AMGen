Question: Passage: Coming off an easy win over the 49ers, the Seahawks flew to INVESCO Field at Mile High for an interconference duel with their former division rival, the Broncos. In the first quarter Seattle trailed early as QB Kyle Orton made a 13-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal, followed in the second quarter by RB Correll Buckhalter getting a 1-yard TD run. Then kicker Matt Prater made a 20-yard field goal to put the Broncos up 17-0. In the third quarter Seattle tried to cut the lead when QB Matt Hasselbeck completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Ben Obomanu, but Denver scored with RB Knowshon Moreno getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter Seattle fell further behind when Orton found WR Demaryius Thomas on a 21-yard TD pass. Seattle would make the final score of the game when Hasselbeck scrambled 20 yards to the endzone for a touchdown.
Question: How many points did Seattle trail by at the half?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_12
proposed answer: To find out how many points Seattle trailed by at halftime, we need to look at the scoring in the first half of the game. In the first quarter, the Broncos scored a touchdown (7 points) and in the second quarter, they scored another touchdown (7 points) and a field goal (3 points). This gives the Broncos a total of 17 points by halftime. Since the passage indicates that Seattle did not score any points in the first half, they trailed by the full 17 points that the Broncos scored. Therefore, the analysis shows that Seattle was behind by 17 points at halftime.
