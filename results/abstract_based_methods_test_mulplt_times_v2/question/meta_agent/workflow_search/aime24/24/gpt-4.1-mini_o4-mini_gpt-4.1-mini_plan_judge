Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_24
proposed answer: We previously found 4a+3b+2c = -25/8. Putting it in lowest terms gives m=25, n=8, so m+n = 25+8 = 33.

proposed answer: We previously found 4a+3b+2c=7/2. In lowest terms m/n = 7/2, so m=7 and n=2. Therefore m+n=7+2=9.
