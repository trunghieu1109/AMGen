Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_7
proposed answer: We have the relation 10/x = 2y/5. Cross-multiplying gives 10·5 = 2y·x, so 50 = 2xy, hence xy = 50/2 = 25. Therefore, the product x·y is 25.

Iteration: Test_multiple_times_7
proposed answer: We have the relation 10/x = 2y/5. Multiply both sides by x to get 10 = (2y/5)⋅x, then multiply both sides by 5 to get 50 = 2yx, and divide by 2 to obtain 25 = x⋅y. Thus the product xy equals 25.
