Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_27
proposed answer: From the determined value N=5694, we have Q = ⌊5694/1000⌋ = 5 and R = 5694 mod 1000 = 694. Therefore Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.

Iteration: Test_multiple_times_27
proposed answer: We know from the prior analysis that the greatest four-digit integer N satisfying “changing any one of its digits to 1 yields a multiple of 7” is N=5624. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=⌊5624/1000⌋=5 and R=5624 mod 1000=624. Therefore Q+R=5+624=629.
