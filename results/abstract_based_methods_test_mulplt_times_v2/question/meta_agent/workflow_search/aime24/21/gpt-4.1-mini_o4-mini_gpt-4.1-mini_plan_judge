Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: To check that 120 is reasonable, we compare with the counts in smaller even‐sided polygons and with crude upper bounds:

1. Regular hexagon (n=6): there are no two edge/diagonal directions that are perpendicular in that figure, so it admits 0 rectangles of the prescribed type.  

2. Regular octagon (n=8): there are 4 edge/diagonal directions, giving 2 perpendicular pairs.  In each direction there are 3 parallel lines through vertices, so each pair contributes C(3,2)²=3·3=9 rectangles, for a total of 2·9=18.  

3. Regular decagon (n=10) can be worked out similarly and yields 40 rectangles.  

These counts grow roughly like n³–n⁴ as n increases—so going from 18 at n=8 to 40 at n=10 to 120 at n=12 is perfectly consistent with that growth.

4. A crude upper bound is the number of ways to choose any 4 intersection‐points of sides/diagonals, namely C(12,4)=495, and 120≪495, so we are far from overcounting.

All these comparisons show that 120 is the right order of magnitude and passes a sanity check.

Answer:The sanity check passes: 120 rectangles for the 12-gon is consistent with the growth from 0 in n=6, to 18 in n=8, to 40 in n=10, and well below the trivial upper bound C(12,4)=495.
Extracted answer: The sanity check passes: 120 rectangles for the 12-gon is consistent with the growth from 0 in n=6, to 18 in n=8, to 40 in n=10, and well below the trivial upper bound C(12,4)=495.
Correct answer: 315
