Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_11
proposed answer: From Sub-task 3 we found 147 paths start with an east move and have exactly 4 turns. By symmetry, the same count holds for paths that start with a north move. Hence total paths = 2×147 = 294.

Iteration: Test_multiple_times_11
proposed answer: In Sub-task 3, we found 147 paths when starting East. By symmetry, starting North also yields 147 paths with exactly four turns. Therefore, accounting for both starting directions gives 2×147=294.
