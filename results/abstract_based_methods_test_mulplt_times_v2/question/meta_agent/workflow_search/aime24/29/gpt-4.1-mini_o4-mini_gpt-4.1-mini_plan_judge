Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_29
proposed answer: We need to compute S = 2 * \sum_{k=0}^5 \binom{5}{k}\binom{5}{5-k}. Note that \binom{5}{5-k}=\binom{5}{k}, so the sum inside is \sum_{k=0}^5 \binom{5}{k}^2. It is a known identity that \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}. Here n=5, so the sum is \binom{10}{5} = 252. Multiplying by 2 gives 2*252 = 504.

proposed answer: We need to compute 2 * sum_{k=0}^5 [C(5,k)*C(5,5-k)]. Note C(5,5-k)=C(5,k), so the sum becomes sum_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)^2. It is known that sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k)^2 = C(2n,n). Here n=5, so sum C(5,k)^2 = C(10,5) = 252. Multiplying by 2 gives 504.
