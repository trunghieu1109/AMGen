Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_15
proposed answer: We need to confirm that E4=73 is nonnegative and that substituting it back into the pairwise and triple intersection sums satisfies the inclusion–exclusion equation giving the total of 900 residents. First, check nonnegativity: 73≥0. Next, compute the adjusted sums: base pairwise sum (from E2 and E3) was 1139; adding 6·E4 gives 1139+438=1577. Base triple sum was 234; adding 4·E4 gives 234+292=526. The sum of single counts is 195+367+562+900=2024. Apply inclusion–exclusion: 2024−1577+526−73=(2024−1577)=447, then 447+526=973, and 973−73=900, which matches the total population. Thus all checks pass.

Answer:Yes. E4=73 is a nonnegative integer and, when substituted back into the pairwise and triple intersection sums, the inclusion–exclusion formula 2024−1577+526−73 correctly yields 900, verifying consistency.
Extracted answer: Yes. E4=73 is a nonnegative integer and, when substituted back into the pairwise and triple intersection sums, the inclusion–exclusion formula 2024−1577+526−73 correctly yields 900, verifying consistency.
Correct answer: 073

Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_15
proposed answer: We previously found E4=73. To verify:
1. Nonnegativity: 73 is a positive integer.
2. Pairwise sum: 1139 + 6×73 = 1139 + 438 = 1577.
3. Triple sum: 234 + 4×73 = 234 + 292 = 526.
4. Inclusion–exclusion: Total singles = 195+367+562+900 = 2024.
   Then 2024 − 1577 + 526 − 73 = (2024−1577)=447; 447+526=973; 973−73=900,
   which matches the 900 residents. 
All checks hold, so E4=73 is valid.

Answer:E4 = 73; verification shows all formulas balance correctly.
