Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_23
proposed answer: We reduce the digit-placement problem to choosing nonnegative integers a₁,a₂,a₃ each ≤9 with a₁+a₂+a₃=8. The count of weak compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.

proposed answer: We need to count the number of ways to fill a 2×3 grid with digits so that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers in the rows is 999 and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers in the columns is 99. Label the top row digits d1,d2,d3 and the bottom row digits e1,e2,e3. The row condition says (100d1+10d2+d3)+(100e1+10e2+e3)=999, while the column condition gives (10d1+e1)+(10d2+e2)+(10d3+e3)=99. Adding these two equations yields 110(d1+d2+d3+e1+e2+e3)=1098, so d1+d2+d3+e1+e2+e3=9. But subtracting the column sum equation from the row sum equation gives 90(d1+d2+d3−e1−e2−e3)=900, so d1+d2+d3−e1−e2−e3=10. Solving these yields d1+d2+d3=8 and e1+e2+e3=1. Additionally, each ei must equal 9−di for the column sums to work out. Thus choosing any nonnegative d1,d2,d3 summing to 8 uniquely determines the bottom digits as their 9’s-complements. The number of nonnegative solutions to d1+d2+d3=8 is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.
