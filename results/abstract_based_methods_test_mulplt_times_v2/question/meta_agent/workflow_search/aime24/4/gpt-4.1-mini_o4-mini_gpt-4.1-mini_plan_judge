Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_4
proposed answer: We found in Sub-task 3 by Hensel’s lemma that the least positive integer m modulo 17^2 for which m^4+1≡0 (mod 289) is m≡2−17·inv(4·2^3) (mod 289). Computing f(2)=17, f'(2)=32≡15 (mod 17), inv(15) mod 289=212, we get m≡2−17·212≡2−3604≡155 (mod 289). Checking 155^4+1≡0 (mod 289) confirms this, and 155 is the smallest positive solution.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_4
proposed answer: We have already determined in Sub-task 3 that p=17 is the smallest prime for which n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution, with initial root r=2 mod17. Applying Hensel’s lemma, we set f(x)=x^4+1 and f′(x)=4x^3. At r=2, f(r)=17 and f′(r)=32≡15 mod17, whose inverse is 8. The correction term is f(r)·(f′(r))^{-1}=17·8=136. Thus the lifted solution m≡r−136≡2−136=−134≡155 mod289. Since 155 is the least positive residue below 289, it is the desired m satisfying 155^4+1≡0 mod17^2.
