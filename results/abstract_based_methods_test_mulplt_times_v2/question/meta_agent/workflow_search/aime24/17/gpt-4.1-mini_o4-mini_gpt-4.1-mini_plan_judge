Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_17
proposed answer: To count all ordered triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers with a+b+c=300 and E=300(ab+ac+bc)−3abc=6 000 000, observe that for any a≠100 one shows algebraically that the only solutions satisfy {a,b,c}={a,100,200−a}. Requiring nonnegativity gives a∈[0,200], but the multiset {a,100,200−a} is the same as when replacing a by 200−a, so there are 101 distinct multisets as a runs from 0 to 100. For a=100 the multiset is {100,100,100}, giving 1 ordered triple; for each of the other 100 multisets the three entries are distinct, giving 6 permutations each. Hence total=(100⋅6)+1=601.

Iteration: Test_multiple_times_17
proposed answer: To satisfy E=300(ab+bc+ca)−3abc=6 000 000 with a+b+c=300 and a,b,c≥0, we split into cases:

1) One variable is 0.  Say c=0.  Then abc=0⇒p=0⇒k=0 and ab+ac+bc=ab=20 000, with a+b=300.  Solving a+b=300, ab=20 000 gives a,b=100,200 in either order.  Permuting the zero among (a,b,c) yields 3! arrangements of {0,100,200} ⇒6 ordered triples.

2) No variable is 0.  Try a=b=x, c=300−2x>0.  A computation shows the only solution of E=6 000 000 occurs at x=100⇒c=100, i.e. (100,100,100).  This yields one ordered triple (all entries equal).

No other patterns yield integer nonnegative solutions.  Total ordered triples =6+1=7.
