Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_14
proposed answer: From the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1 and the condition that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, one derives an expression for BD^2 as a function f(t) of a parameter t. Analysis shows f(t) = 480 sec^2 t + 336 tan^2 t, whose minimum as t varies over real numbers approaches 480 (since sec^2 t ≥ 1 and tan^2 t ≥ 0). Thus the infimum of f(t) is 480.

proposed answer: From sub-task 8, the infimum of the range of f(t) was determined to be 480. Therefore, the integer value of the infimum is 480.
