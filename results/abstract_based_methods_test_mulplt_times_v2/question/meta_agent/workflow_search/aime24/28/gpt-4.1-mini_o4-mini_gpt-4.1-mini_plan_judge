Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We set up the torus’s generating circle center at C_g=(6,0) in the xz–plane with tube radius a=3, and the sphere center at C_s=(0,z) with sphere radius S=11.  In the two tangency configurations the distance between centers is D₁=|S–a|=8 (inner‐tube contact) or D₂=S+a=14 (outer‐tube contact).  In each case the unique tangent point P lies on the line C_gC_s and satisfies P=C_g+a/(±D)(C_s–C_g).  Carrying out the vector division gives x–coordinate (which is the radius of the contact circle) of
• for D₁=8: r₁ = 6 – (3·6)/8 = 6 – 18/8 = 15/4,
• for D₂=14: r₂ = 6 – (3·6)/14 = 6 – 18/14 = 33/7.
According to the problem’s notation r_i corresponds to the larger contact‐circle radius (33/7) and r_o to the smaller (15/4), so
 r_i – r_o = 33/7 – 15/4 = (132 – 105)/28 = 27/28.
Hence m=27, n=28 and m+n=27+28=55.
