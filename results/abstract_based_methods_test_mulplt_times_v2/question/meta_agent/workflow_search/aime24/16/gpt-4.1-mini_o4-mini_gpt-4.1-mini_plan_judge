Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_16
proposed answer: We use the relation bc = 2Δ/ sin A. From Sub‐task 11, Δ = 36√30; from Sub‐task 7, sin A = 2√30/13. Thus
bc = 2·(36√30)/(2√30/13) = 72√30·(13/(2√30)) = (72/2)·13 = 36·13 = 468.

Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_16
proposed answer: We know from previous results that the area Δ of triangle ABC is 36√30 and that sin A = 2√30/13. Using the area formula Δ = ½ · b · c · sin A, we solve for b · c:  b · c = 2Δ/sin A = 2·(36√30)/(2√30/13). Simplifying gives (72√30)·(13/(2√30)) = 36·13 = 468. Thus the product BC = AB·AC is 468.
