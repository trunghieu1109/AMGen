Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We seek the smallest integer base b≥2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers.  A two-digit base-b number n = x·b + y satisfies x+y = √n = s, so n = s² = x·b + y and x+y = s.  Eliminating x,y gives s(s−1) divisible by b−1.  Equivalently, b−1 must divide s(s−1), so each solution s mod (b−1) satisfies s≡0 or 1 mod each prime‐power factor of b−1.  Hence the total number of residue classes s mod(b−1) is 2^ω(b−1), where ω(b−1) is the number of distinct prime factors of b−1.  Two trivial solutions s=0,1 lie below the range of valid √n≥1, so the count of valid s≥2 is 2^ω(b−1)−2.  We require 2^ω(b−1)−2>10 ⇒ 2^ω(b−1)>12 ⇒ ω(b−1)≥4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, giving b−1=210 ⇒ b=211.  This yields 2^4−2=14 valid b-beautiful integers (>10) and is minimal.
