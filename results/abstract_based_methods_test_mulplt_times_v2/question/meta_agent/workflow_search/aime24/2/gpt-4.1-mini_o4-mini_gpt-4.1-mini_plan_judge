Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_2
proposed answer: From subtask 9 we have the reduced fraction m/n = 115/256. Thus m = 115 and n = 256. The requested value is m + n = 115 + 256 = 371.

What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_2
proposed answer: From sub-task 9 we have the fraction 111/256 in lowest terms, so m=111 and n=256. Their sum is 111+256=367.
