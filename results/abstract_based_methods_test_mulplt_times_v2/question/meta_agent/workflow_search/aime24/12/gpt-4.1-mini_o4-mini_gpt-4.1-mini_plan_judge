Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_12
proposed answer: We have the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z with |z|=4. Writing z=4e^{iθ}, we can rewrite the sum in the form R·cos(θ+φ) for some R. By direct computation (or by noting that the magnitude of the complex coefficients times 4 gives R), one finds R=540. Since the cosine factor ranges between –1 and 1, the maximum of R·cos(θ+φ) is R·1=540. Hence the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Iteration: Test_multiple_times_12
proposed answer: We set z=4e^{iθ}, so (75+117i)z+(96+144i)/z =  (75+117i)·4e^{iθ} + (96+144i)·(1/4)e^{-iθ}.  Expanding gives a real part f(θ)=324 cosθ−432 sinθ, which can be written as 540 cos(θ+φ) for some φ.  Since cos(θ+φ)≤1, the maximum of f(θ) is 540.
