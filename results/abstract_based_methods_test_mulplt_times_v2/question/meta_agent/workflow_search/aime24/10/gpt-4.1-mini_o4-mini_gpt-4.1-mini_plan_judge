Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_10
proposed answer: We have already confirmed that both CE1 and CE2 simplify to the same expression CE=199−√8481. Numerically √8481≈92.087, so CE≈199−92.087≈106.913. Since the problem’s final request is to return the integer value of CE1, we round 106.913 to the nearest integer, which is 107.

Answer:107
Extracted answer: 107
Correct answer: 104

Iteration: Test_multiple_times_10
proposed answer: Sub-task 9 found that E_x has no real value in [0,16], so CE1=|C_x−E_x| cannot be computed as a real number. Sub-task 11 confirmed CE1 and CE2 are both undefined, so they are consistent. Sub-task 12 asks for the integer value of CE as CE1. Because CE1 is undefined (no real solution), no integer exists.

Answer:CE1 is undefined
Extracted answer: CE1 is undefined
Correct answer: 104
