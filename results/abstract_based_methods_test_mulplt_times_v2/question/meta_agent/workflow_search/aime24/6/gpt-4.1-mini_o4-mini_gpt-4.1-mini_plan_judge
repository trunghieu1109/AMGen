Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_6
proposed answer: We must choose the box in B with the largest space‐diagonal d, since the minimal enclosing sphere has radius r=d/2.  From the constraint SurfaceArea=54 and Volume=23, assuming two edges equal t gives a cubic whose positive roots are t=2 and t=2√6−1≈3.898.  For t=2, the third edge x=23/t²=23/4, so d²=2·2²+(23/4)²=8+529/16=657/16, hence r²=d²/4=(657/16)/4=657/64.  For t=2√6−1, one finds a smaller d².  Thus r²=657/64 in lowest terms, so p=657, q=64 and p+q=721.

proposed answer: We need the maximum radius r of a sphere that contains any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The space‐diagonal d of a box with edges a,b,c is d^2=a^2+b^2+c^2, and r=d/2 so r^2=d^2/4. Given constraints ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23, symmetry suggests two equal edges b=c=t and a=x. Then xt^2=23 ⇒ x=23/t^2, and 2xt+t^2=27 ⇒ 46/t+t^2=27 ⇒ t^3−27t+46=0 with positive roots t=2 and t=2√6−1. For t=2, x=23/4 ⇒ d^2=(23/4)^2+2·2^2=529/16+8=657/16 ⇒ r^2=(657/16)/4=657/64. For t=2√6−1, r^2≈8.17<657/64≈10.27. Thus the maximum r^2=657/64, p+q=657+64=721.
