Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_19
proposed answer: We have P = 8321. Dividing by 1000 yields 8321 = 8×1000 + 321, so the remainder is 321.

is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_19
proposed answer: We have P=8321 from sub-task 8. To compute P mod 1000, divide 8321 by 1000: 8321=8×1000+321. The remainder upon division by 1000 is therefore 321.
