Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_22
proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 (so at least two 9’s and no other number appears that often) and an integer median that isn’t in the list. An even-length list gives a median that’s the average of the two middle numbers; for this to be an integer not in the list, those two entries must bracket that missing integer by 1 each. Testing small even-size lists with two 9’s: the only solution is [5,7,9,9] since 5+7+9+9=30, the median=(7+9)/2=8 (8∉list), and 9 is the unique mode. Squaring and summing: 5²+7²+9²+9²=25+49+81+81=236.
