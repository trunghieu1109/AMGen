Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_8
proposed answer: We need the number of positive integers n≤2024 with n mod 5∈{0,2}. 
1. Count of n≡0 mod 5: those are 5,10,…,2020. There are ⌊2024/5⌋=404 such numbers. 
2. Count of n≡2 mod 5: those are 2,7,…,2022. The largest term is 2022=5·404+2, so there are 404+1=405 such numbers. 
Adding gives 404+405=809.

Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_8
proposed answer: We determined that positions where Bob has a winning strategy are exactly those with n mod 5 in {0,2}. We counted numbers ≤2024 congruent to 0 mod 5: floor(2024/5)=404. We counted numbers ≤2024 congruent to 2 mod 5: the largest k with 5k+2≤2024 gives k=404, so 405 numbers (including k=0). Summing gives 404+405=809.
