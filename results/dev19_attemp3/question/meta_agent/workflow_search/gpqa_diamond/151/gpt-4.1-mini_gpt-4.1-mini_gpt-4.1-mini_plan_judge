Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_20_151
proposed answer: Shmoo formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a mating response that activates a transcriptional program requiring active chromatin states. Active chromatin regions are characterized by the presence of transcription-related complexes such as the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which assembles at promoters to initiate transcription, and enhancer protein complexes, which facilitate transcriptional activation. Nucleosome histone complexes are fundamental components of chromatin structure and are present regardless of chromatin activity, although their modifications can indicate activity. The pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is primarily involved in DNA replication licensing during the G1 phase and is not typically associated with transcriptionally active chromatin regions. Since the assay targets active chromatin in shmoo cells, proteins from the pre-initiation complex, enhancer complexes, and nucleosomes will be enriched and detected. Proteins from the pre-replication complex will be least observed because DNA replication initiation is not the focus during mating response and active transcription. Even considering different cell cycle phases, the mating response prioritizes transcription over replication, making the pre-replication complex the least likely to be detected in this context.
