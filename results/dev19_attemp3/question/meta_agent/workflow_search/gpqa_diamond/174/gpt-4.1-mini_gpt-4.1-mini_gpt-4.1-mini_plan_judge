proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. The radiation pattern in the far field depends on the angle θ from the z-axis and the wavelength λ. The dominant radiation mode for such a system is typically the electric dipole moment oriented along the z-axis. The angular distribution of power radiated per unit solid angle for an electric dipole is proportional to sin^2(θ). This means the power is zero along the axis (θ=0° or 180°) and maximum at θ=90°. Evaluating sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the power at θ=30° is one quarter of the maximum power A. Regarding wavelength dependence, classical electrodynamics states that the power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole scales as the fourth power of frequency, or equivalently as λ^{-4}. Higher multipole moments (e.g., quadrupole) have more complex angular distributions and steeper wavelength scalings (e.g., λ^{-6}), which do not match the given options as well. Among the choices, only choice C) matches both the fraction 1/4 at θ=30° and the λ^{-4} dependence. Other choices either mismatch the angular fraction or the wavelength scaling, making them less plausible for the given scenario. Therefore, the correct and physically consistent answer is choice C).

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. Due to the symmetry, the electric dipole moment along the z-axis is suppressed, making the electric quadrupole the dominant radiation mode. The angular dependence of electric quadrupole radiation is proportional to sin^2(2θ), which peaks at θ = 45°. Evaluating the fraction of maximum power at θ = 30°, we calculate sin^2(60°) = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4, meaning 75% of the maximum power A is radiated at 30°. This matches the fraction given in choice B. Regarding wavelength dependence, dipole radiation power scales as λ^{-4}, while quadrupole radiation power scales as λ^{-6}, due to the higher order time derivatives involved in quadrupole moment oscillations. Since the problem’s geometry suppresses dipole radiation and favors quadrupole radiation, the λ^{-6} dependence is physically justified. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or incorrect wavelength scaling inconsistent with the dominant multipole radiation. Therefore, choice B) '3/4, λ^{-6}' correctly matches both the angular fraction at 30° and the wavelength dependence for quadrupole radiation from a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution.
