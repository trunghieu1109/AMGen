proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires precise control over the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Starting from benzene, the first step must be Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group. This group is electron-donating and ortho/para directing, so subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions will occur preferentially at the ortho and para positions relative to the tert-butyl group. Next, nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 introduces a nitro group, which is strongly electron-withdrawing and meta directing. Given the tert-butyl group at position 2, nitration will occur at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl), matching the target substitution pattern. The nitro group is then reduced to an amine using Fe/HCl, which is compatible with the tert-butyl substituent and necessary for further functionalization. The amine is converted to a diazonium salt via NaNO2/HCl, which is then hydrolyzed to phenol using H3O+, H2O, and heat. Finally, the phenol is converted to the ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis using NaOH/EtBr. This sequence ensures the correct regiochemistry and functional group transformations without introducing unnecessary sulfonation steps, which could complicate the synthesis and reduce yield. The other options either include sulfonation or reorder steps in a way that risks incorrect substitution patterns or functional group incompatibility. The chosen sequence respects directing effects, functional group compatibility, and synthetic practicality, minimizing side reactions and maximizing yield. Therefore, the best reaction sequence is choice A.

proposed answer: The target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires precise control over the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The tert-butyl group is bulky and ortho/para-directing, so introducing it first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3) is logical. However, direct nitration after tert-butylation tends to give substitution at the para position relative to the tert-butyl group, which is not desired here since the nitro group must be at the meta position (3-position). To achieve this, a blocking group strategy is necessary. Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) introduces a sulfonic acid group at the para position relative to the tert-butyl group, effectively blocking nitration at that site and directing nitration to the meta position. After nitration, the sulfonic acid group can be removed by dilute acid hydrolysis (dilute H2SO4). Next, the nitro group is reduced to an amine (Fe/HCl), which can be diazotized (NaNO2/HCl) and then hydrolyzed (H3O+, heat) to form a phenol. The phenol is then converted to the ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr). This sequence respects directing effects, uses blocking/deblocking strategies effectively, and maintains functional group compatibility, ensuring high regioselectivity and yield. Among the given options, only choice 3 follows this logical and practical sequence: tert-butylation, sulfonation (blocking), nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, sulfonate removal, and etherification. Other choices either lack the blocking step before nitration, have incorrect order of steps, or start with nitration before tert-butylation, which is incompatible with the desired substitution pattern. Therefore, choice 3 is the best sequence for the high-yield synthesis of the target compound, addressing and correcting the key failures of previous attempts by incorporating a blocking group strategy and proper order of functional group transformations.
