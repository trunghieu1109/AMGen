Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_190
proposed answer: The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, which contains a ketone at position 1, a hydroxymethyl group at position 3, and an isopropenyl group at position 5. Step 1 involves treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), which deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl substituent, forming an alkoxide ion. This alkoxide then undergoes nucleophilic substitution with benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether at position 3 (product 1). The ketone and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged. Step 2 involves reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in catalytic HCl, which converts the ketone at position 1 into a tosyl hydrazone (product 2), leaving the benzyl ether and isopropenyl group intact. Step 3 involves treatment with n-butyllithium at low temperature, which initiates a Shapiro reaction on the tosyl hydrazone, generating a vinyl lithium intermediate at position 1 after elimination of nitrogen gas. Upon aqueous ammonium chloride quench, this intermediate is protonated to form an alkene at position 1 (product 3). The benzyl ether remains intact. Step 4 involves catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere, which reduces the alkene at position 1 to an alkane, saturating the ring at that position. Simultaneously, benzyl ethers are cleaved under these hydrogenolysis conditions, regenerating the free hydroxyl group at position 3. The isopropenyl substituent at position 5 is also hydrogenated to an isopropyl group. Therefore, the final product (product 4) is a cyclohexane ring with a free hydroxymethyl group at position 3, an isopropyl substituent at position 5, and a saturated carbon at position 1 (formerly the ketone). Among the given choices, choice A) '(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol' best matches this structure, representing a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl substituent and a free hydroxymethyl group. The other choices represent intermediates (tosyl hydrazone), benzyl-protected ethers, or structures inconsistent with the reaction sequence (e.g., 1-butyl substitution). Hence, choice A is the correct final product consistent with the entire reaction sequence and mechanistic reasoning.
