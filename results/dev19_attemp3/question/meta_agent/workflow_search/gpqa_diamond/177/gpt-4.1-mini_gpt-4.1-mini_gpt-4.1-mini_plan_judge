proposed answer: The interaction Lagrangian is given by \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). In four-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4. To find the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we analyze the dimensions of the fields and operators involved. The Dirac spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2, derived from the kinetic term \( \bar{\psi} i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi \) which must have dimension 4. The electromagnetic field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2, since it involves derivatives (dimension 1) of the gauge field \( A^\mu \) (dimension 1). The operator \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \) is dimensionless because gamma matrices are constant matrices without mass dimension. Therefore, the combined mass dimension of the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 5 \). Since the total dimension of the Lagrangian term must be 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). Regarding renormalizability, coupling constants with negative mass dimension correspond to nonrenormalizable interactions because they introduce operators of dimension greater than 4, leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Hence, the theory described by this interaction term is not renormalizable. This conclusion is consistent with standard quantum field theory principles and is supported by multiple detailed derivations. Among the provided options, the one that matches the mass dimension \( -1 \) and nonrenormalizability is choice C).
