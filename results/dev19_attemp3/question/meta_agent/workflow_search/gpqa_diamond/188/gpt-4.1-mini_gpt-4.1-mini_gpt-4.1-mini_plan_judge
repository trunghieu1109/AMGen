proposed answer: To determine which effective particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each particle's origin and relation to symmetry breaking in detail:

1. Magnon: Magnons are quantized spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered systems such as ferromagnets or antiferromagnets. These systems exhibit spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry because the ground state magnetization chooses a specific direction, breaking the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Magnons are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken continuous symmetry, so they are directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons characterized by stable, particle-like spin textures in certain magnetic materials. Their existence depends on the order parameter field configuration in a phase where spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. Although skyrmions themselves are not Goldstone bosons, their stability and presence rely on the spontaneously broken symmetry of the host system. Therefore, skyrmions are indirectly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

3. Pion: Pions are mesons in particle physics that can be interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This spontaneous symmetry breaking is fundamental to their low mass and properties, so pions are directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

4. Phonon: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in crystals. The crystal lattice explicitly breaks continuous translational symmetry of free space down to discrete lattice translations. This breaking is explicit rather than spontaneous because the lattice structure is fixed by atomic positions and chemical bonding, not chosen spontaneously by the system’s ground state. Although the formation of a crystal from a liquid involves spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry, phonons themselves are excitations of an already established lattice and do not represent Nambu-Goldstone modes of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Hence, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same fundamental way as magnons, skyrmions, or pions.

In summary, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are associated (directly or indirectly) with spontaneously-broken symmetry, while phonons are not. This conclusion is consistent with standard theoretical understanding in condensed matter and particle physics. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

proposed answer: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state of a system does not share the symmetry of the underlying physical laws, leading to emergent collective excitations known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs). Among the given effective particles: Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin-wave excitations arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them NGBs associated with SSB. Pions are mesons interpreted as NGBs resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, directly linked to SSB. Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations that emerge because the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken down to the discrete symmetry of the crystal lattice; thus, phonons are also NGBs associated with SSB. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons—stable, localized field configurations characterized by nontrivial topology. While they often appear in systems where symmetry is broken, they are not themselves NGBs and do not arise directly from SSB. Instead, their existence depends on the topology of the order parameter space rather than the breaking of a continuous symmetry. Therefore, magnons, pions, and phonons are effective particles directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries as NGBs, while skyrmions are not. This classification is consistent across various physical contexts and is supported by rigorous theoretical understanding.
