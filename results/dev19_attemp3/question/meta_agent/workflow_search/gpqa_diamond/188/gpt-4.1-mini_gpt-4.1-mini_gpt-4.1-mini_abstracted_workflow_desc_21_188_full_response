Magnons arise from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them NGBs linked to SSB. Pions are understood as NGBs from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, so they are also directly connected to SSB. Phonons emerge as quantized lattice vibrations due to the breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to the discrete lattice symmetry of crystals, which is a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking; hence, phonons are also associated with SSB. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topology in the order parameter space. Their existence depends on topological properties rather than the direct breaking of a continuous symmetry. They are not NGBs and do not arise as a direct consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Therefore, among the listed effective particles, skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same direct sense as magnons, pions, and phonons.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SBK6:\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) refers to a situation where the ground state of a system does not possess the symmetry of the underlying laws governing it, leading to the emergence of collective excitations known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs). Among the given options: Magnons arise as spin-wave excitations due to spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnets, so they are associated with SSB. Pions are interpreted as NGBs emerging from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, clearly linked to SSB. Phonons arise from the breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to the discrete symmetry of a crystal lattice; this is considered a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking, making phonons NGBs associated with SSB. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topology in the order parameter space. While they often appear in systems with broken symmetries, they are not themselves NGBs and do not directly result from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their existence is tied to topological properties rather than symmetry breaking per se. Therefore, among the four, skyrmions are the effective particles not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. This conclusion is consistent with rigorous definitions and resolves ambiguities regarding phonons and skyrmions.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent aMqf:\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) results in the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs), which are low-energy excitations reflecting the broken continuous symmetries.

The key criterion is whether the particle is a Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) or a low-energy excitation directly arising from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Magnons arise from spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them NGBs associated with SSB. Pions are NGBs resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, clearly linked to SSB. Phonons correspond to quantized lattice vibrations and are NGBs associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to discrete lattice symmetry in crystals. This is a well-established example of SSB in condensed matter physics. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topology and stable localized field configurations. They do not arise as NGBs from SSB but rather as topological defects or textures that can exist in phases with or without SSB. Their existence depends on the topology of the order parameter space rather than the breaking of a continuous symmetry per se. Therefore, the assumption that Skyrmions are associated with SSB is incorrect. The ambiguity sometimes arises because Skyrmions appear in systems where symmetry is broken, but they themselves are not excitations due to SSB. This distinction is crucial and often overlooked. The previous classifications correctly identified Skyrmions as not associated with SSB, while Magnons, Pions, and Phonons are associated.

This leads to the emergence of new collective excitations or particles associated with the broken symmetry. (a) In crystal formation, continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken down to the discrete symmetry of the crystal lattice. This breaking gives rise to phonons, which are quantized lattice vibrations and act as Nambu-Goldstone bosons corresponding to the broken continuous translational symmetry. Thus, phonons are indeed associated with SSB. (b) Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) are gapless excitations that arise due to continuous symmetry breaking, characterized by fluctuations around the new ground state. In contrast, topological solitons or defects, such as skyrmions, are stable, localized configurations of fields with nontrivial topology but are not themselves NGBs. They may exist in phases with or without spontaneous symmetry breaking but are not directly the result of SSB. (c) For an effective particle to be 'associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry,' it should be a Nambu-Goldstone boson or an excitation directly arising from the broken continuous symmetry of the ground state. Magnons (spin-wave excitations) arise from spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry, pions are NGBs from chiral symmetry breaking, and phonons are NGBs from translational symmetry breaking. Skyrmions, being topological solitons, do not fit this criterion as they are not NGBs but rather stable topological configurations. Therefore, phonons should be recognized as associated with SSB, and skyrmions should not.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent QOO5, defining SSB concepts, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state (or vacuum) of a system does not exhibit the full symmetry of the underlying laws or Hamiltonian. In condensed matter and particle physics, SSB leads to the emergence of low-energy excitations called Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs), which correspond to the broken continuous symmetries. (a) In the context of crystal formation, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken down to a discrete lattice symmetry when atoms arrange themselves periodically. This breaking of continuous translational symmetry gives rise to phonons, which are quantized lattice vibrations and serve as NGBs associated with this SSB. Thus, phonons are indeed effective particles arising from SSB. (b) Nambu-Goldstone bosons are gapless excitations directly linked to continuous symmetry breaking, whereas topological solitons or defects, such as skyrmions, are stable localized configurations characterized by topological invariants rather than being direct excitations of broken symmetries. Skyrmions do not necessarily arise from SSB; they are topological objects that can exist in systems with or without broken continuous symmetries. (c) For an effective particle to be 'associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry,' it must be a low-energy excitation (typically gapless) that emerges as a direct consequence of the breaking of a continuous symmetry, i.e., a Nambu-Goldstone boson or a related mode. Topological defects or solitons are not classified as such effective particles because they represent stable configurations rather than excitations corresponding to broken symmetries. Therefore, magnons (spin-wave excitations from broken spin rotational symmetry), pions (NGBs from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD), and phonons (NGBs from broken translational symmetry in crystals) are associated with SSB, while skyrmions, being topological solitons, are not. This clarification resolves previous ambiguities and establishes rigorous criteria for classification.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent TI6T, defining SSB concepts, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state (vacuum) of a system does not exhibit the symmetry of the underlying laws or Hamiltonian, leading to the emergence of new collective excitations or modes. (a) In crystal formation, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken down to the discrete translational symmetry of the crystal lattice. This breaking gives rise to phonons, which are quantized lattice vibrations and are identified as Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the broken continuous translational symmetry. Thus, phonons are indeed effective particles arising from SSB. (b) Nambu-Goldstone bosons are gapless excitations resulting from continuous symmetry breaking, characterized by long-wavelength collective modes. In contrast, topological solitons or defects, such as skyrmions, are stable, localized configurations characterized by nontrivial topology rather than arising directly as gapless modes from SSB. They represent distinct topological sectors of the theory rather than Nambu-Goldstone bosons. (c) For an effective particle to be 'associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry,' it must arise as a low-energy collective excitation (Nambu-Goldstone boson) due to the spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry, reflecting the degeneracy of ground states and the resulting gapless modes. Topological solitons, while related to the field's topology and sometimes appearing in systems with broken symmetries, do not qualify under this strict criterion because they are not gapless excitations emerging from the symmetry breaking but rather stable, localized solutions. This clarification resolves ambiguity: phonons are indeed associated with SSB as Nambu-Goldstone bosons of broken translational symmetry; magnons and pions are also Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin rotational and chiral symmetries, respectively; skyrmions are topological solitons and not Nambu-Goldstone bosons, thus not directly associated with SSB in the same sense.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent dlEa, round 0, classifying particles, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state of a system does not share the symmetry of the underlying laws, leading to emergent collective excitations known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs).

Therefore, while magnons, pions, and phonons are effective particles directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, skyrmions are not. This classification aligns with rigorous definitions of SSB and the nature of NGBs versus topological excitations.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent gGQg, round 0, classifying particles, thinking: To classify the four effective particles with respect to their association with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), we consider the nature of each: (1) Magnons are collective spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered systems. They arise because the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken in the ordered phase, making magnons Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) directly linked to SSB. (2) Pions in quantum chromodynamics are interpreted as NGBs resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, thus clearly associated with SSB. (3) Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations arising from the breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to discrete lattice symmetry during crystal formation. This is a classic example of SSB, and phonons serve as the corresponding NGBs. (4) Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or stable field configurations characterized by nontrivial topology. They can exist in phases with broken symmetry but are not themselves NGBs nor do they arise directly as a consequence of SSB. Instead, they are topological defects or excitations that require a broken symmetry phase but are not associated with the symmetry breaking in the same direct manner. Therefore, magnons, pions, and phonons are NGBs arising directly from SSB, while skyrmions are topological solitons existing in broken-symmetry phases but not themselves NGBs. This classification aligns with the rigorous definitions and resolves ambiguities around phonons and skyrmions.

Pions are NGBs resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons correspond to quantized lattice vibrations and are NGBs arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the crystal lattice formation. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or defects characterized by nontrivial topology and do not correspond to NGBs; they may exist in broken-symmetry phases but are not themselves associated directly with spontaneous symmetry breaking as NGBs. Therefore, Magnons, Pions, and Phonons belong to category (a), NGBs arising directly from SSB, while Skyrmions belong to category (b), topological solitons existing in broken-symmetry phases but not themselves Goldstone modes. There is no indication that any of these arise from explicit symmetry breaking in this context (category (c)).; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent xh1F, round 0, classifying particles, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when the ground state of a system does not share the symmetry of its governing laws, resulting in emergent collective excitations known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs). To classify the given effective particles: 1) Magnons are quantized spin waves arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them NGBs associated with SSB. 2) Pions can be understood as NGBs resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, directly linked to SSB. 3) Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations that emerge because the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken down to the discrete symmetry of the crystal lattice; thus, phonons are also NGBs associated with SSB. 4) Skyrmions are topological solitons—stable, localized field configurations characterized by nontrivial topology.

The key criterion is whether the particle is a Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) or a low-energy excitation directly arising from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Magnons arise from spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them NGBs associated with SSB. Pions are NGBs resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, clearly linked to SSB. Phonons correspond to quantized lattice vibrations and are NGBs associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to discrete lattice symmetry in crystals. This is a well-established example of SSB in condensed matter physics. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topology and stable localized field configurations. They do not arise as NGBs from SSB but rather as topological defects or textures that can exist in phases with or without SSB. Their existence depends on the topology of the order parameter space rather than the breaking of a continuous symmetry per se. Therefore, the assumption that Skyrmions are associated with SSB is incorrect. The ambiguity sometimes arises because Skyrmions appear in systems where symmetry is broken, but they themselves are not excitations due to SSB. This distinction is crucial and often overlooked. The previous classifications correctly identified Skyrmions as not associated with SSB, while Magnons, Pions, and Phonons are associated. This classification aligns with rigorous physical understanding and the clarified problem framing. No residual conceptual errors remain after this review.

The reasoning is sound: Magnons, Pions, and Phonons are all Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries—spin rotational symmetry for Magnons, chiral symmetry for Pions, and continuous translational symmetry for Phonons. Phonons, despite arising from lattice vibrations, are indeed associated with spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to discrete lattice symmetry, a well-established example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in condensed matter physics. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons or textures characterized by nontrivial topology of the order parameter space. They do not themselves arise as Nambu-Goldstone bosons from spontaneous symmetry breaking but exist as stable topological configurations that can appear in phases with or without spontaneous symmetry breaking. This distinction is crucial and often misunderstood. The solution carefully distinguishes these cases and aligns with rigorous physical understanding.

To answer this, we classify each particle based on whether it arises as a Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) or a low-energy excitation directly resulting from SSB, or if it is a different type of excitation.\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered systems. These systems exhibit spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry. Magnons are recognized as NGBs associated with this SSB.\n\n2.

Phonon: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations. The formation of a crystal lattice breaks the continuous translational symmetry of free space down to the discrete symmetry of the lattice. This breaking is spontaneous, and phonons act as NGBs corresponding to the broken continuous translational symmetry. Thus, phonons are associated with SSB.\n\n4.

This classification is supported by rigorous theoretical definitions and aligns with the physical nature of these excitations across condensed matter and particle physics contexts.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent wHaN, synthesizing final classification, thinking: The question asks which of the given effective particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (SSB). To answer this, we consider the nature of each particle and its relationship to SSB: 1. Magnon: These are quasiparticles representing spin-wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials. They arise due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in the ground state. Hence, magnons are Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) associated with SSB. 2. Pion: In particle physics, pions can be understood as NGBs arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are classic examples of particles linked directly to SSB. 3. Phonon: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in crystals. The formation of a crystal lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry of free space down to a discrete lattice symmetry spontaneously. Phonons are thus NGBs associated with this SSB. 4. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons—stable, localized field configurations characterized by nontrivial topology. They do not arise as NGBs from spontaneous symmetry breaking but are topological defects or textures that may exist in phases with or without SSB. Their existence depends on the topology of the order parameter space rather than on a continuous symmetry being spontaneously broken. Therefore, skyrmions are not associated with SSB in the same sense as the other particles. Summarizing, magnons, pions, and phonons are NGBs directly associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries. Skyrmions, while related to systems that may have broken symmetry, are topological solitons, not NGBs, and thus not associated directly with SSB. Hence, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the skyrmion. This conclusion is supported by rigorous definitions, literature consensus, and critical review of the nature of these particles.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Hnbh, determining particle not associated with SSB, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) leads to the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs), which are effective particles associated directly with the broken continuous symmetries. Magnons arise from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them NGBs linked to SSB. Pions are understood as NGBs from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, so they are also directly connected to SSB. Phonons emerge as quantized lattice vibrations due to the breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to the discrete lattice symmetry of crystals, which is a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking; hence, phonons are also associated with SSB. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topology in the order parameter space. Their existence depends on topological properties rather than the direct breaking of a continuous symmetry. They are not NGBs and do not arise as a direct consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Therefore, among the listed effective particles, skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same direct sense as magnons, pions, and phonons.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent SBK6, determining particle not associated with SSB, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) refers to a situation where the ground state of a system does not possess the symmetry of the underlying laws governing it, leading to the emergence of collective excitations known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs). Among the given options: Magnons arise as spin-wave excitations due to spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnets, so they are associated with SSB. Pions are interpreted as NGBs emerging from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, clearly linked to SSB. Phonons arise from the breaking of continuous translational symmetry down to the discrete symmetry of a crystal lattice; this is considered a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking, making phonons NGBs associated with SSB. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topology in the order parameter space. While they often appear in systems with broken symmetries, they are not themselves NGBs and do not directly result from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their existence is tied to topological properties rather than symmetry breaking per se. Therefore, among the four, skyrmions are the effective particles not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. This conclusion is consistent with rigorous definitions and resolves ambiguities regarding phonons and skyrmions.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent aMqf, determining particle not associated with SSB, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) results in the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs), which are low-energy excitations reflecting the broken continuous symmetries. Among the given effective particles: Magnons arise due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered materials, making them NGBs linked to SSB. Pions are interpreted as NGBs from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, directly tied to SSB. Phonons correspond to quantized lattice vibrations emerging because the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken to the discrete symmetry of the crystal lattice; thus, phonons are also NGBs associated with SSB. Skyrmions, in contrast, are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial topological configurations of the order parameter field. They are stable, localized excitations whose existence depends on the topology of the order parameter space rather than directly arising from the breaking of a continuous symmetry. Skyrmions are not NGBs and are not themselves a consequence of SSB, but rather topological objects that can exist in systems with or without spontaneously broken symmetries. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.; answer: B)", iteration_idx=-1)]
