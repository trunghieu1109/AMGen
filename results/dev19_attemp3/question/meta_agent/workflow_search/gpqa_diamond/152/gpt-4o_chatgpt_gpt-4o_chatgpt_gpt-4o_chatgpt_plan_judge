Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each Michael addition reaction and compare the predicted products with the given choices. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate is deprotonated by NaOEt to form an enolate, which attacks the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, leading to the formation of trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For reaction (B), the enamine 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, resulting in 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For reaction (C), 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione forms an enolate that attacks but-3-en-2-one, giving 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. These products match the ones listed in choice 1. Therefore, the correct answer is A).
