proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be either +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each pairwise product S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. We enumerate all configurations to find the distinct energy levels and their degeneracies. When all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 3, and energy E = -3J. There are 2 such configurations. For all other configurations (6 in total), the sum of pair products is -1, so energy E = +J. The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-beta E}, which is Z = 2 * e^{-beta * (-3J)} + 6 * e^{-beta * (J)} = 2 * e^{3J beta} + 6 * e^{-J beta}. Comparing this with the given options, choice A matches exactly. This is consistent with the physics of the system and the counting of states, and no other option matches the derived expression. Therefore, the most consistent partition function is choice A.
