proposed answer: The initial state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). First, normalize it by calculating its norm: sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). The normalized initial state is therefore |ψ> = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). The eigenspace of operator P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1). Normalize this eigenvector: its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is |v_0> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Next, project the normalized initial state |ψ> onto this eigenspace by calculating the inner product c = <v_0|ψ> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) · (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6) = (-1/√12) + 0 + (-1/√12) = -2/√12 = -1/√3. The projected (unnormalized) vector is c * |v_0> = (-1/√3) * (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = (-1/√6, 0, 1/√6). The norm of this projected vector is sqrt((-1/√6)^2 + 0 + (1/√6)^2) = sqrt(1/6 + 1/6) = sqrt(1/3) = 1/√3. Normalize the post-measurement state by dividing by this norm: (-1/√6, 0, 1/√6) / (1/√3) = (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2). The global phase (-1) is physically irrelevant, so the normalized post-measurement state after measuring P with eigenvalue 0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). This state is the correct post-measurement state to be used for the subsequent measurement of Q. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1, and the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is spanned by the vector (0, 0, 1). To find the probability of measuring Q = -1 after measuring P = 0, we project the post-P=0 state onto this eigenspace and take the squared magnitude of the inner product. The inner product is <q_-1|ψ_post> = (0, 0, 1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2. The probability is the modulus squared of this inner product: | -1/√2 |^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of measuring Q = -1 immediately after measuring P = 0 is 1/2. This calculation respects the quantum mechanical postulates of measurement, state collapse, and normalization, and the global phase does not affect the probability. Hence, the final answer is choice A).

proposed answer: The problem involves sequential quantum measurements on a system initially in the state |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). First, we normalize this state to |ψ_norm⟩ = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). The operator P has an eigenvalue 0 with eigenspace spanned by |v_0⟩ = (1, 0, -1). Normalizing |v_0⟩ gives |v_0_norm⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ_norm⟩ onto |v_0_norm⟩: ⟨v_0_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = -1/√3, so the probability is | -1/√3 |^2 = 1/3. After measuring P=0, the system collapses to |v_0_norm⟩. Next, measuring Q on this post-P=0 state, Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 corresponding to the basis vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) respectively. The probability of measuring Q=-1 given P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |v_0_norm⟩ onto (0,0,1), which is |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2. The joint probability of sequentially measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probability of the first measurement and the conditional probability of the second measurement: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. This step is crucial to distinguish between the conditional probability P(Q=-1|P=0) = 1/2 and the joint probability P(P=0 and Q=-1) = 1/6. The problem explicitly asks for the joint probability, so the answer is 1/6, corresponding to choice B). This reasoning carefully follows quantum measurement postulates, normalization, projection calculations, and distinguishes conditional from joint probabilities, ensuring the correct final answer.
