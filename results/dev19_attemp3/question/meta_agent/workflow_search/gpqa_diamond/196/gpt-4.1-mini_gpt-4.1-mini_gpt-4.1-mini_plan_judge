proposed answer: The IR spectrum of compound X shows a broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of the O–H stretch in a carboxylic acid group. The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C=C stretches, confirming an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), typical of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each integrating for 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) correspond well to a sec-butyl group. Therefore, compound X is best identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the reaction conditions generate phosphorus triiodide (PI3) in situ, which converts the carboxylic acid group into an alkyl iodide intermediate. This intermediate is then reduced to an alkane, effectively replacing the carboxylic acid group with a methyl group on the aromatic ring. The sec-butyl substituent remains unchanged at the para position.

Among the given options, only 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Choice A) matches the expected product after this reduction. The starting material 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Choice B) is not the product after reaction. The other options (Choices C and D) do not fit the spectral data or the expected reaction outcome.

Thus, the most plausible final product after the reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Choice A).
