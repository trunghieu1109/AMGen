The operator σ · n is Hermitian and has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1 and the dot product with a unit vector corresponds to a rotation that does not change eigenvalues. Multiplying by ε, which has units of energy, scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The problem does not include the factor ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian, which would be present if the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ were used.

Multiplying by the scalar ε (an energy constant) scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The problem does not include any factor of ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian, so eigenvalues involving ħ/2 are inconsistent with the given operator. Also, eigenvalues ±1 alone lack the correct energy dimension.

The operator σ · n represents the spin projection along the direction n. Since σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z each have eigenvalues ±1, and n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n also has eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, which has units of energy, the eigenvalues of H become ±ε. The problem statement does not include any factor of ħ or ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian definition, so those factors should not appear in the eigenvalues. The choices involving ħ/2 correspond to spin angular momentum eigenvalues, but the Hamiltonian as given is simply ε times σ · n, not ε times the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ. Therefore, the correct eigenvalues are ±ε, matching choice A). Choices involving ±ε ħ/2 or ±ħ/2 are inconsistent with the given Hamiltonian expression and its dimensions.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n also has eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. The constant ε has dimensions of energy, so the eigenvalues have dimensions of energy as well. The problem statement does not include any explicit factor of ħ or ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian. In quantum mechanics, the spin operator S is often written as (ħ/2) σ, so if the Hamiltonian were expressed in terms of the spin operator S, it might include ħ/2 factors. However, here the Hamiltonian is given directly in terms of the Pauli matrices without these factors. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±ε, not involving ħ. Including ħ or ħ/2 in the eigenvalues would be incorrect unless the Hamiltonian explicitly includes those factors. Thus, the physical constant ħ is not present in the Hamiltonian or its eigenvalues as given, and the eigenvalues are simply ±ε. This clarifies the ambiguity regarding ħ: it does not appear in the eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian as stated.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, clarifying hbar role, thinking: The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices weighted by the components of n, which preserves the eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, which has dimensions of energy, scales the eigenvalues to ±ε. The problem statement does not include any explicit factor of ħ or ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian. In quantum mechanics, spin operators are often written as S = (ħ/2) σ, so if the Hamiltonian were given as H = ε S · n, then eigenvalues would involve ħ/2. However, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is directly proportional to σ · n without ħ/2. Hence, the eigenvalues are ±ε, not involving ħ. The presence of ħ in some answer choices likely arises from confusion with the spin operator definition, but since the problem explicitly defines the Hamiltonian as ε σ · n, ħ does not appear. Therefore, the physical constant ħ is not present in the Hamiltonian or its eigenvalues here, resolving any ambiguity. The eigenvalues depend solely on ε and the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices, which are ±1. Thus, the eigenvalues are ±ε without any factor of ħ or ħ/2.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 4ely, transforming spectral properties to eigenvalues, thinking: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. The operator σ · n is a Hermitian operator representing the spin projection along the direction n. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices weighted by components of n, which does not change the eigenvalues; hence, σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. The Hamiltonian is scaled by ε, which has dimensions of energy, so the eigenvalues of H are simply the eigenvalues of σ · n multiplied by ε, resulting in ±ε. The problem statement does not include any factor of ħ or ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian. Although spin operators are often written as S = (ħ/2) σ, here the Hamiltonian is explicitly given in terms of σ without the factor ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues do not contain ħ or ħ/2. The eigenvalues are energy values ±ε. The choices involving ±ε ħ/2 or ±ħ/2 correspond to spin operator eigenvalues, not the given Hamiltonian eigenvalues. The choice ±1 is dimensionally inconsistent because the Hamiltonian is an energy operator and must have eigenvalues with energy dimension.

Each Pauli matrix \\( \\sigma_i \\) has eigenvalues \\( \\pm 1 \\). Since \\( \\vec{n} \\) is a unit vector, the operator \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z \\) is a linear combination of Pauli matrices weighted by components of \\( \\vec{n} \\) such that the magnitude of the vector is 1. This operator can be interpreted as a spin operator projected along the direction \\( \\vec{n} \\). Importantly, the eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) remain \\( \\pm 1 \\) because it is a unitary rotation of the spin operator, and eigenvalues are invariant under unitary transformations. The Hamiltonian is given as \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), where \\( \\varepsilon \\) is a constant with dimensions of energy. Multiplying the operator by \\( \\varepsilon \\) scales the eigenvalues by \\( \\varepsilon \\). Thus, the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are \\( +\\varepsilon \\) and \\( -\\varepsilon \\). Regarding the role of \\( \\hbar \\), it does not explicitly appear in the Hamiltonian. Typically, spin operators are expressed as \\( \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\vec{\\sigma} \\), so if the Hamiltonian was \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), eigenvalues would involve \\( \\hbar/2 \\). However, since the problem states the Hamiltonian directly in terms of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\) without \\( \\hbar/2 \\), the eigenvalues do not include \\( \\hbar \\). Therefore, the eigenvalues are \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\). This matches choice A) exactly. Other choices involving factors \\( \\hbar/2 \\) or just \\( \\pm 1 \\) without scaling by \\( \\varepsilon \\) do not correspond to the given Hamiltonian.
