proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. The operator σ · n is a Hermitian operator representing the spin projection along the direction n. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices weighted by the components of n, which corresponds to a rotation of the spin operator. Such a rotation does not change the eigenvalues, so σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, which has dimensions of energy, scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The problem statement does not include any factor of ħ or ħ/2 in the Hamiltonian. Although spin operators are often expressed as S = (ħ/2) σ, here the Hamiltonian is explicitly given in terms of σ without the factor ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues do not contain ħ or ħ/2. The eigenvalues must have dimensions of energy, so ±1 alone is dimensionally inconsistent. The choices involving ħ/2 correspond to spin angular momentum eigenvalues, not the Hamiltonian eigenvalues as given. Hence, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H are +ε and -ε, matching choice A).
