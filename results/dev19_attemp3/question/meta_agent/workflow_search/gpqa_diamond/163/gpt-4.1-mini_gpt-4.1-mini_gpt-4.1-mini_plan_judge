Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the given orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Both systems are eclipsing binaries, implying their orbital planes are nearly edge-on, so the observed radial velocity amplitudes approximate the true orbital velocities. 

Step 1: Calculate the total velocity amplitude for each system by summing the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars:
- system_1: 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s
- system_2: 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s

Step 2: Apply Kepler's third law, which relates the total mass M of a binary system to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a as M ∝ a^3 / P^2. The semi-major axis a can be expressed in terms of the orbital velocity v and period P as a = v * P / (2π), where v is the sum of the orbital velocities of the two stars (here approximated by the sum of RV amplitudes).

Step 3: Substitute a into Kepler's law to get M ∝ (v * P)^3 / P^2 = v^3 * P.

Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the total masses:
M1 / M2 = (v1^3 * P1) / (v2^3 * P2) = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432.

This means system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2, or about 0.4 times. This matches choice A).

Potential sources of error include non-circular orbits or inclination angles differing from 90°, but eclipses strongly suggest near edge-on orbits and circular orbits (implied by sinusoidal RV curves). The assumption that RV amplitudes correspond directly to orbital velocities is justified here. Therefore, the best supported answer is A).
