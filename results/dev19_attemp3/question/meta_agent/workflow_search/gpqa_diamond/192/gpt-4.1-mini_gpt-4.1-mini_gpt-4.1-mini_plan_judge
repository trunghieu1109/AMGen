proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars per unit parallax interval varies as N(plx) ∝ 1/(plx^5). Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance r, i.e., plx = k/r for some constant k. Substituting this into the star count relation gives N(plx) ∝ 1/((k/r)^5) = r^5 / k^5, so the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as r^5. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit distance interval, N(r). To convert from per unit parallax interval to per unit distance interval, we use the chain rule and the Jacobian of the transformation: N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/d(r)|. Differentiating plx = k/r gives d(plx)/d(r) = -k/r^2, and its absolute value is k/r^2. Therefore, N(r) ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This means the number of stars per unit distance interval varies as r^3. This result is consistent with physical intuition because the volume of a spherical shell at distance r scales as r^2, and the given parallax dependence introduces an additional factor of r, resulting in an overall r^3 dependence. Considering all possible interpretations and the necessary change of variables, the final relationship is N(r) ∝ r^3, which corresponds to choice C). All debate agents agree on this conclusion, confirming its correctness.
