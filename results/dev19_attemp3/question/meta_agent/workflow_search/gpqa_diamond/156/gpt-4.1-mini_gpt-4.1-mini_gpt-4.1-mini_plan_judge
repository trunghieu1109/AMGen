proposed answer: Retroviruses are RNA viruses that carry their genetic material as RNA, which is reverse transcribed into DNA inside the host cell. Therefore, the viral genome in the virion is RNA, not DNA. This means that any molecular diagnostic approach must begin with reverse transcription of viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) before amplification or sequencing. Direct DNA sequencing or PCR without reverse transcription is inappropriate because it would not detect the viral RNA genome directly. Antibody detection methods such as ELISA targeting IgG antibodies detect the host immune response rather than the virus itself. Since antibodies take days to weeks to develop post-infection, this method is unsuitable for quick detection during an outbreak. Symptom-based identification is nonspecific and unreliable for molecular diagnostic design. Among PCR techniques, real-time PCR (quantitative PCR) is preferred for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection, allowing for quick and accurate diagnosis without the need for post-PCR processing. Nested PCR, while sensitive, is more time-consuming and prone to contamination due to multiple amplification steps. Therefore, the best approach is to first identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing (after reverse transcription of viral RNA) and then develop a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis. This approach directly targets the viral genome, ensures early detection, reduces contamination risk, and provides quantitative data, making it the most suitable and effective diagnostic method for a retroviral outbreak. The workflow would involve extracting viral RNA from patient samples, reverse transcribing it into cDNA, sequencing the cDNA to identify viral sequences, designing primers and probes specific to the viral cDNA, and then using real-time PCR to detect and quantify the viral load quickly and accurately in clinical samples.
