Choice 1 involves DNA sequencing and PCR, which is not ideal for retroviruses as they are RNA viruses. This method may not be accurate for retroviruses and could be slower due to the initial DNA sequencing step. Choice 2 involves identifying IgG antibodies and developing an ELISA kit, which detects the host\'s immune response.
