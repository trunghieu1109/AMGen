Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature.

proposed answer: The problem involves two mean free paths: λ1, the classical mean free path of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum state without the electron beam, and λ2, the effective mean free path when the electron beam is active and electrons scatter off gas molecules. Since the temperature and pressure remain constant, the change in mean free path arises solely from the difference in collision dynamics when electrons interact with gas molecules. Electrons are much lighter and faster than gas molecules, and their scattering cross-section with gas molecules is generally smaller than that of gas-gas molecule collisions. This means electrons travel longer distances on average before scattering, implying λ2 > λ1. The factor 1.22 likely represents a theoretical or empirical upper bound on how much larger λ2 can be compared to λ1, accounting for differences in scattering cross-sections and collision frequencies. Options suggesting λ2 equals λ1 or λ2 is less than λ1 contradict the physics of scattering processes in this context. Therefore, the most physically consistent and theoretically supported conclusion is that λ2 lies between λ1 and 1.22 times λ1, i.e., λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1. This conclusion aligns with kinetic theory, scattering physics principles, and the detailed reasoning from multiple expert analyses, making option B) the most reasonable and justified choice.

proposed answer: The problem distinguishes two mean free paths: λ1, the mean free path of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum environment, and λ2, the mean free path relevant when the electron beam is initiated, involving electron scattering with gas molecules. Both mean free paths depend inversely on the product of gas molecule number density (n) and scattering cross section (σ). Since the vacuum pressure and temperature remain constant, the gas molecule number density n does not change. The key difference lies in the scattering cross sections: gas-gas molecular collisions have a relatively large cross section (σ_gas-gas), whereas high-energy (1000 kV) electrons have much smaller scattering cross sections with gas molecules (σ_e-gas). Because the mean free path λ = 1/(n*σ), a smaller scattering cross section results in a longer mean free path. Therefore, electrons have a longer mean free path than gas molecules under the same conditions, implying λ2 > λ1. The factor 1.22 mentioned in some options likely represents a minimal theoretical or empirical correction factor derived from scattering theory or experimental data, indicating λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1 or greater. Options stating λ2 = λ1 or λ2 < λ1 contradict the fundamental physics of scattering cross sections and mean free path relationships. The intermediate option λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 is less consistent with typical scattering cross section differences and the given factor 1.22. Hence, the physically and quantitatively consistent conclusion is λ2 ≥ 1.22 * λ1, reflecting that electrons travel longer distances on average before scattering than gas molecules do. This conclusion aligns with kinetic theory, scattering physics, and known experimental data for electron microscopy at ultra-high vacuum and high electron energies. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
