Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves multiple light particles (2E and 2V) emitted, allowing the total energy of the E particles to vary continuously due to the many possible ways energy and momentum can be shared among the emitted particles. This results in a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. Since M is massless, it carries no rest mass energy, effectively increasing the total energy available to the E particles compared to the original decay where two massive V particles were emitted. Although the number of emitted light particles decreases from four to three, there are still multiple light particles (2E and M) sharing energy and momentum, which maintains the continuous nature of the energy spectrum. The shape of the spectrum changes due to the different mass and number of emitted particles, and the endpoint of the E energy spectrum increases because the massless M particle allows more energy to be available to the E particles. The spectrum does not become discrete because discreteness typically arises in two-body decays or decays with fixed energy levels, which is not the case here. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
