proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), defined on the disk where x^2 + y^2 < 4, i.e., radius 2 in Euclidean coordinates. The conformal factor Omega^2 = 32 / (4 - r^2) with r^2 = x^2 + y^2 diverges as r approaches 2, causing the metric to become singular at the boundary. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2, we integrate the area element dA = Omega^2 dx dy over the disk. Converting to polar coordinates, the area integral becomes A = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^2 (32 / (4 - r^2)) r dr dθ = 2π ∫_0^2 (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr. Evaluating the integral ∫_0^2 (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr by substitution u = 4 - r^2 leads to a logarithmic divergence at the upper limit r=2 (u=0). This divergence means the area integral does not converge to a finite value but instead tends to infinity. The other answer choices involving finite expressions with x and y inside the area formula are invalid, as area is a scalar and must be a finite or infinite scalar, not a function of coordinates. Zero area is impossible given the positive definite metric and the integrand's positivity. Hence, the only consistent and correct answer is that the area is infinite, choice A).
