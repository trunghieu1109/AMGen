Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 82Lb', content='The problem involves calculating the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in solution. Given: total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M, thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The cumulative constants relate the concentration of each complex to free Co2+ and SCN- concentrations as follows: [Co(SCN)] = β1*[Co2+]*[SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^2, etc. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co2+ and all complexed species: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Substituting the values: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Therefore, [Co2+] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.001692 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 relative to total cobalt is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.92%. This matches choice A) 16.9%.

These constants represent the overall equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands, respectively. The species involved are free Co2+ and complexes Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species. Given the large excess of SCN- (0.1 M) compared to cobalt (10^-2 M), the free SCN- concentration can be approximated as constant. The equilibrium expressions for the complexes can be derived using the cumulative constants as follows: [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n for n=1 to 4. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ[Co(SCN)n] = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for [Co2+], we get [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). This approach is consistent, uses the cumulative constants correctly, and accounts for all species. It assumes constant free SCN- concentration due to its large excess, which is reasonable. This method allows calculation of the concentration of each complex and thus the distribution of cobalt species in solution. Therefore, the most consistent and correct equilibrium expressions are those that express each complex concentration as [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n with [Co2+] calculated from the total cobalt concentration divided by the sum of all terms as above.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task stage_1.subtask_2 output: thinking - The mass balance for cobalt must account for all cobalt-containing species in the solution: the free Co2+ ion and its complexes with thiocyanate ions having 1 to 4 SCN- ligands. The cumulative stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4 relate the concentrations of these complexes to the free Co2+ and free SCN- concentrations. Specifically, the concentration of the complex with n SCN- ligands is given by [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n. Therefore, the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is the sum of the free Co2+ and all complex species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + β1*[Co2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^4. This can be factored as c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). This formulation is consistent with the definition of cumulative stability constants and includes all species, ensuring completeness. It allows solving for the free Co2+ concentration if the free SCN- concentration is known or approximated. Given that the SCN- concentration is much higher than cobalt concentration, it can be approximated as constant, simplifying calculations.

The cumulative stability constants βn relate the concentrations of the complexes to the free ion and ligand concentrations as follows:\n\n[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]\n[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2\n[Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^3\n[Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\nwhere β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16, and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration c(Co) is the sum of all species:\n\nc(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the complexes in terms of [Co2+] and [SCN-], we get:\n\nc(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)\n\nFrom this, [Co2+] can be solved as:\n\n[Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)\n\nOnce [Co2+] is known, the concentration of each complex can be calculated.

The cumulative stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4 relate the concentrations of the complexes to the free ions as follows: [Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co2+] * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^3, and [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. Substituting the expressions for the complexes in terms of [Co2+] and [SCN-], we get: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). From this, we can solve for [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Once [Co2+] is known, the concentration of each complex can be found using the equilibrium expressions. This approach assumes that the free SCN- concentration remains approximately constant, which is valid because [SCN-] is much larger than c(Co). This derivation covers all possible species and allows calculation of their concentrations at equilibrium. Thus, the equilibrium expressions for all complexes are derived in terms of total cobalt concentration, free SCN- concentration, and cumulative stability constants.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent subI, formulating mass balance, thinking: To formulate the mass balance equation for total cobalt, we consider all cobalt-containing species present in the solution. These include the free Co2+ ion and its complexes with thiocyanate ions: Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The total cobalt concentration (c(Co)) is given as 10^-2 M, which equals the sum of the concentrations of all these species. Using the cumulative stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4, we can express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free Co2+ concentration and the free SCN- concentration. Specifically, the concentration of Co(SCN)n is [Co2+]*βn*[SCN-]^n, where βn is the cumulative stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. Therefore, the mass balance equation for cobalt is: c(Co) = [Co2+] + β1*[Co2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^4. This can be factored as: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Given the total cobalt concentration and the free SCN- concentration (initially approximated as 0.1 M), this equation can be used to solve for the free Co2+ concentration. If the free SCN- concentration is not constant due to complexation, a similar mass balance for SCN- would be needed, but since [SCN-] is much larger than c(Co), it can be approximated as constant. This mass balance equation is fundamental to determining the distribution of cobalt species and, subsequently, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.

The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species. Using the cumulative stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4, and the free SCN- concentration [SCN-], the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of [Co2+] and [SCN-] as: [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co2+] * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^3, and [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^4. Therefore, the mass balance equation for cobalt is: c(Co) = [Co2+] + β1 * [Co2+] * [SCN-] + β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2 + β3 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^3 + β4 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^4. This can be factored as c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1 * [SCN-] + β2 * [SCN-]^2 + β3 * [SCN-]^3 + β4 * [SCN-]^4). This equation relates total cobalt concentration to free cobalt ion concentration and free SCN- concentration. If the free SCN- concentration is not known, this equation can be used along with other equilibria or assumptions to solve for it.

The mass balance equation for total cobalt is: c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. Substituting the expressions for the complexes, we get: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). This equation relates the total cobalt concentration to the free Co2+ concentration and the free SCN- concentration. If the free SCN- concentration is not known exactly, this equation can be used in conjunction with the total SCN- concentration and other equilibrium relationships to solve for the free SCN- concentration. This formulation is essential for calculating the distribution of cobalt species and, specifically, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.
