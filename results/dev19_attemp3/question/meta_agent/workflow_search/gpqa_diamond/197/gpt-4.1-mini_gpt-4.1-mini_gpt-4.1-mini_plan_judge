proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in solution. Given: total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M, thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The cumulative constants relate the concentration of each complex to free Co2+ and SCN- concentrations as follows: [Co(SCN)] = β1*[Co2+]*[SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2*[Co2+]*[SCN-]^2, etc. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co2+ and all complexed species: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Substituting the values: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Therefore, [Co2+] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.001692 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 relative to total cobalt is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.92%. This matches choice A) 16.9%. The assumption that free SCN- concentration remains about 0.1 M is reasonable given its large excess compared to cobalt. The calculation uses cumulative constants correctly and accounts for all species. Hence, the best answer is A).
