proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation models space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device under specific assumptions. These assumptions are critical for the equation's validity: (1) The device must be trap-free, meaning no traps capture carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship. Traps would change the voltage dependence and invalidate the simple quadratic form of the equation. (2) The device must be single-carrier, i.e., transport dominated by either electrons or holes, but not both. Two-carrier devices introduce recombination and complex transport dynamics not accounted for by the equation. (3) The contacts must be Ohmic, providing efficient carrier injection without significant energy barriers. Schottky contacts introduce injection barriers that limit current differently and invalidate the equation. (4) Diffusion current must be negligible compared to drift current, as the equation assumes drift-dominated transport under the applied electric field. Negligible drift current contradicts the SCLC regime and thus is invalid. Evaluating the four statements: Statement 1 correctly states trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (implying Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, matching all assumptions. Statement 2 incorrectly assumes negligible drift current, which contradicts the drift dominance in SCLC. Statement 3 involves a two-carrier device, which is not covered by the Mott-Gurney model. Statement 4 involves a Schottky contact, which introduces injection barriers, violating the Ohmic contact assumption. Therefore, only Statement 1 (Choice A) is true and consistent with the established validity criteria of the Mott-Gurney equation.
