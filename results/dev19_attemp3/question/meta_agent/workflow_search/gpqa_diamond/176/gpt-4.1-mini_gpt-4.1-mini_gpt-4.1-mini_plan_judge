proposed answer: The problem states that both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission, which implies via Wien's displacement law that their surface temperatures are equal (T1 = T2). The luminosity L of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since the temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends solely on the square of the radius ratio: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Given that R1 = 1.5 × R2, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass ratio and radial velocities do not affect the intrinsic luminosity calculation here. Although radial velocity can cause Doppler shifts, the problem states the peak wavelengths are the same, indicating any Doppler effect is either corrected or negligible. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25. Among the given options (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), ~2.25 matches the calculated ratio exactly and is the most consistent choice.

proposed answer: The problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with Star_1 having a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and the same mass ratio. Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away from the observer, while Star_1 has zero radial velocity. This radial velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength of Star_2. Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal, the intrinsic peak wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1 to compensate for the Doppler redshift. Using the relativistic Doppler formula, the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2 is approximately 0.9977 times that of Star_1. By Wien's displacement law, temperature is inversely proportional to intrinsic peak wavelength, so T2/T1 ≈ 1.0023, meaning Star_2 is intrinsically about 0.23% hotter than Star_1. The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to the square of its radius and the fourth power of its temperature: L = 4πR^2σT^4. Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/1.0023)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9909 ≈ 2.23. The mass ratio does not directly affect the luminosity calculation here. Ignoring Doppler and temperature corrections would yield a ratio of exactly 2.25, but considering these corrections, the ratio is slightly less, about 2.23. Among the given choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the closest is ~2.23 (choice D). This conclusion is consistent across multiple detailed analyses and accounts for Doppler correction, temperature differences, and radius scaling, while correctly excluding mass scaling from the luminosity calculation. The verification step confirms that all physical effects (Doppler shift, temperature correction, radius scaling) have been properly accounted for before finalizing the answer. Therefore, the best choice is D).
