The luminosity of a star, assuming it is a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law as L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is determined by the ratio of their radii squared. Therefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

The Stefan-Boltzmann Law states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its temperature (T), given by L = σAT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature, the difference in luminosity is due to the difference in their surface areas. The surface area of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (A = 4πR^2). Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, its surface area is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Both stars have the same temperature because they have the same peak wavelength. Therefore, the temperature term T^4 is the same for both stars and cancels out when comparing the luminosities. Star_1 has a radius R_1 = 1.5R_2, where R_2 is the radius of Star_2. The luminosity of Star_1, L_1, is proportional to R_1^2, and the luminosity of Star_2, L_2, is proportional to R_2^2. Thus, the ratio of their luminosities is L_1/L_2 = (R_1^2)/(R_2^2) = (1.5R_2)^2/R_2^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25.
