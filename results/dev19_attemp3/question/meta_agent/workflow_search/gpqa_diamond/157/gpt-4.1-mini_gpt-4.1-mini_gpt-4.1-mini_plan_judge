Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation located in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor. Dominant-negative mutations typically function by the mutant protein interacting with the wild-type protein and disrupting its normal function. Since the mutation is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein is likely still capable of binding to the wild-type protein, forming heterodimers. However, these heterodimers are nonfunctional, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype despite the presence of one wild-type allele. This interaction can cause protein aggregation or formation of nonfunctional complexes that sequester the wild-type protein. Protein degradation of the wild-type allele is less likely because dominant-negative mutations usually interfere by complex formation rather than by promoting degradation. A gain-of-function phenotype is inconsistent with the dominant-negative loss-of-function nature of the mutation. The option describing loss of protein dimerization with a wild-type phenotype contradicts the dominant-negative effect, which requires interaction between mutant and wild-type proteins. Therefore, the most plausible molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, as it aligns with the dominant-negative mechanism disrupting normal dimerization and function while maintaining protein presence.
