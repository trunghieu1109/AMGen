proposed answer: The solar proton-proton chain has three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each produces neutrinos with characteristic energy spectra. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos mainly from the beta decay of 8B, which have energies mostly above 1 MeV. The two energy bands considered here are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), both below 1 MeV. The 800-900 keV band is dominated by monoenergetic 7Be neutrinos from the pp-II branch at 862 keV. The 700-800 keV band has minimal contribution from pp-III neutrinos. Since the pp-III neutrinos are mostly above 1 MeV, stopping the pp-III branch would drastically reduce neutrinos above 1 MeV but have negligible effect on neutrino fluxes in the 700-900 keV range. Therefore, the fluxes in both bands remain approximately the same after stopping the pp-III branch. Consequently, the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) remains about 1. This conclusion is consistent with the known solar neutrino energy spectra and the dominant sources of neutrinos in these bands. Considering the neutrino travel time (~8.5 minutes), the effect of stopping the pp-III branch would be observed now, but since these bands are unaffected, the ratio does not change. Hence, the best answer is C).

proposed answer: The problem concerns the effect on solar neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch produces 8B neutrinos with a broad energy spectrum extending to high energies, including a low-energy tail that overlaps both bands. The pp-II branch produces 7Be neutrinos, notably a line at 862 keV, which lies within the 800-900 keV band (band 2). The pp-I branch neutrinos have energies below ~420 keV and do not contribute significantly to these bands. When the pp-III branch stops, the 8B neutrino flux disappears after about 8.5 minutes (the neutrino travel time). This cessation causes a significant reduction in neutrino flux in both bands due to the loss of 8B neutrinos. However, band 2 retains a substantial flux from the unaffected 7Be neutrinos, while band 1 loses most of its flux because it is more dependent on 8B neutrinos. Therefore, the flux in band 1 decreases more drastically than in band 2. This means the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) decreases significantly after stopping the pp-III branch. The ratio would be much less than 1, likely around 0.1 or 0.01. Among the given choices, 0.1 (10^-1) or 0.01 (10^-2) are plausible. Given the dominant 7Be neutrino line in band 2 and the near elimination of 8B neutrinos in band 1, the ratio is expected to be closer to 0.1 or even 0.01. This reasoning aligns with the spectral data and the known branching ratios of the solar neutrino production. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A) 0.1 (10^-1).
