proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a secondary peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity) clearly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom due to the natural isotopic distribution of chlorine (Cl-35 and Cl-37). This isotopic pattern is a key piece of evidence confirming the presence of chlorine in the molecule. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is characteristic of O-H stretching vibrations typically found in carboxylic acids. Additionally, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group rather than an aldehyde or ester. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating for one proton, which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating for two protons. This splitting pattern is indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring, where the symmetry causes the aromatic protons to split into two equivalent sets, each appearing as doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons. Other substitution patterns (ortho or meta) would produce more complex splitting patterns and different integration ratios. Among the candidates, 4-chlorobenzoic acid has a para substitution pattern (chlorine and carboxylic acid groups opposite each other on the benzene ring), which matches the NMR splitting pattern. 2-chlorobenzoic acid has ortho substitution, which would produce a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets each integrating for two protons. 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde contains an aldehyde and phenolic OH, which would not produce the broad O-H stretch seen in the IR and would have different NMR signals, including an aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm rather than a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. Phenyl chloroformate is an ester, lacking the acidic proton and broad O-H stretch, and would not show the NMR pattern observed. Therefore, considering molecular weight, isotope pattern, IR, and NMR data collectively, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all spectral features consistently. This conclusion is supported by multiple independent analyses and is the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified compound.
