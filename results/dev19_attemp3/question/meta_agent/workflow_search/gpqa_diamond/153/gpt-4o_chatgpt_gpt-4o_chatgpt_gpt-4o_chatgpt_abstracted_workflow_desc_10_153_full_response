Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent e89k', content='The problem involves identifying a chemical compound based on spectral data, which is a task commonly encountered in organic chemistry. The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a secondary peak at m/z = 158, which suggests the presence of chlorine due to its isotopic pattern. The IR spectrum indicates a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is typical for an O-H group, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, suggesting a carbonyl group, likely in a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a peak at 11.0 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and peaks at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, indicative of aromatic protons. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits these spectral features well as it contains a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and an aromatic ring.
