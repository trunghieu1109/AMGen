Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The problem involves identifying a chemical compound based on spectral data, which is a task commonly encountered in organic chemistry. The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a secondary peak at m/z = 158, which suggests the presence of chlorine due to its isotopic pattern. The IR spectrum indicates a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is typical for an O-H group, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, suggesting a carbonyl group, likely in a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a peak at 11.0 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and peaks at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, indicative of aromatic protons. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits these spectral features well as it contains a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and an aromatic ring. The other choices either do not match the spectral data as closely or lack a chlorine atom. Thus, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most consistent with the given data.
