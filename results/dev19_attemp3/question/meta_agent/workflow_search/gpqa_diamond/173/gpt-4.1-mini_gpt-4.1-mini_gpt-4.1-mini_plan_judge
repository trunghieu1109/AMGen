Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

proposed answer: The initial nucleus has rest mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. After fission, it splits into two fragments with rest masses m and 2m such that m + 2m = 0.99 M = 297 GeV. Thus, m = 99 GeV and the heavier fragment has rest mass 198 GeV. The missing 1% of mass (3 GeV) converts into kinetic energy of the two fragments. Conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta p. The total energy after fission is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, where E1 = sqrt(p^2 + 198^2) and E2 = sqrt(p^2 + 99^2). Solving this equation for p numerically yields p approximately 0.6 GeV/c. The relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is T1 = E1 - 198 GeV. The classical kinetic energy approximation is T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * 198). Because the kinetic energies are small compared to rest energies, the fragments are mildly relativistic, and the classical approximation slightly underestimates the kinetic energy. The difference between the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical kinetic energy for the heavier fragment is about 5 MeV. This difference arises because the relativistic kinetic energy includes higher-order terms in momentum that the classical formula neglects. Therefore, the difference is approximately 5 MeV, corresponding to choice B).
