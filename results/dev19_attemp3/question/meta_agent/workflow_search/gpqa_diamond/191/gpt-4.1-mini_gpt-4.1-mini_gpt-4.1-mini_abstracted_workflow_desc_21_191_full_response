A charge +q is placed inside the cavity. We want to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at distance L > R from the conductor\'s center. According to electrostatics and the properties of conductors, the electric field inside the conductor\'s material is zero, and any excess charge resides on the conductor\'s outer surface. The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge distribution on the cavity\'s inner surface and an equal and opposite induced charge on the conductor\'s outer surface, maintaining overall neutrality. By Gauss\'s law, the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the conductor is +q, since the conductor is uncharged and the induced charges on the outer surface sum to +q. The conductor shields the internal charge distribution\'s multipole moments, so the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge and behaves as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the conductor\'s center.

Therefore, the external electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge +q located at the conductor\'s center, independent of the cavity\'s offset s or the charge\'s position inside the cavity. Hence, the magnitude of the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), where L is the distance from the conductor\'s center to point P.

The cavity is offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. We want the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R. The key physical principle here is that the conductor shields the internal charge distribution such that the external field is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor's center. This is a direct consequence of the uniqueness theorem in electrostatics and the conductor shielding effect: the induced charges on the conductor surface rearrange to cancel all multipole moments of the internal charge distribution except the monopole moment. Therefore, the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge +q, treated as if concentrated at the conductor center. This means the field at P depends solely on L, the distance from the conductor center to P, and not on l, s, or θ.

The cavity is offset from the conductor's center by a distance s. We want to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R. According to electrostatics, the conductor rearranges its free charges to ensure the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. The charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the cavity's inner surface and an equal and opposite induced charge on the conductor's outer surface. Since the conductor is overall neutral, the total charge on the conductor's outer surface sums to +q to maintain neutrality and satisfy boundary conditions. By Gauss's law, from the perspective of any point outside the conductor, the net enclosed charge is +q. Importantly, the conductor's induced charges cancel all higher multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, etc.) of the internal charge distribution, so the external field is indistinguishable from that of a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor. This is a direct consequence of the uniqueness theorem and conductor shielding effect in electrostatics. Therefore, the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge +q and the distance L from the conductor's center, and is independent of the cavity offset s, the position of the charge inside the cavity, or the angle θ. Hence, the correct expression for the electric field magnitude at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). This matches choice D). Choices A), B), and C) incorrectly suggest dependence on l, s, or θ, which contradicts the shielding effect and the monopole equivalence principle.
