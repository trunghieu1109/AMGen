Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in position is given as Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m. The reduced Planck's constant is ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s. The uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is calculated using Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, giving Δp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx) = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s) / (2 * 0.1 × 10^(-9) m) = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The electron's speed is v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be approximated by ΔE ≈ vΔp, so ΔE = (2 × 10^8 m/s) × (5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s) = 1.0545718 × 10^(-16) J. This value is closest to choice C) ~10^(-16) J. The calculation is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Therefore, the closest match for the energy uncertainty is C) ~10^(-16) J.
