proposed answer: The problem requires estimating the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy ΔE given the uncertainty in position Δx and the electron's velocity v. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp. With Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^-10 m and ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js, Δp ≥ ħ/(2 Δx) = 5.27 × 10^-25 kg·m/s. The electron's momentum p = m v = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg × 2 × 10^8 m/s = 1.822 × 10^-22 kg·m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to Δp by ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp, where p/m = v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. Therefore, ΔE ≈ 2 × 10^8 × 5.27 × 10^-25 = 1.054 × 10^-16 J. Comparing this with the given options (~10^-19 J, ~10^-18 J, ~10^-16 J, ~10^-17 J), the closest is ~10^-16 J (choice C). Although one agent suggested ~10^-17 J, that calculation used a different Δp value (10 times smaller), likely due to a miscalculation in Δp. The correct Δp from the uncertainty principle is on the order of 10^-25, not 10^-26, which leads to ΔE on the order of 10^-16 J. Relativistic effects are neglected as per the problem statement, and the classical approximation is acceptable for an order of magnitude estimate. Hence, the most consistent and physically justified numerical estimate for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is ~10^-16 J, choice C.
