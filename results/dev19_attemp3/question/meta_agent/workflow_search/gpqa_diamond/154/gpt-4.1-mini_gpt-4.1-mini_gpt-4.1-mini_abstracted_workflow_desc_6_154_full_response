The state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is given in this basis. First, we verify the normalization of the state vector: the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1, confirming the state is normalized. Next, we calculate the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, this is the sum over i of |ψ_i|^2 times the eigenvalue of Pz corresponding to the i-th basis vector: ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. Then, we calculate ⟨Pz²⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz²|ψ⟩. The eigenvalues of Pz² are ħ², 0, and ħ², so ⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/2)ħ².
