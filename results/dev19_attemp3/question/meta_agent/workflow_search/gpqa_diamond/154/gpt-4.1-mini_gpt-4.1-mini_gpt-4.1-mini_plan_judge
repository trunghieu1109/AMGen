Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem provides the operator Pz in its eigenbasis, where Pz is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the three basis vectors. The system's state vector is given as |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in this basis. First, verify normalization: the sum of the squares of the absolute values is (1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, so the state is normalized. Next, calculate the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ = Σ |ψ_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. Then calculate ⟨Pz²⟩ = Σ |ψ_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i^2 = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/2)ħ². The uncertainty ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt((1/2)ħ² - 0) = ħ/√2. This matches choice C) exactly. This calculation is direct and consistent with the definitions of expectation values and uncertainties in quantum mechanics. No other choices fit the computed value. Therefore, the correct answer is C).
