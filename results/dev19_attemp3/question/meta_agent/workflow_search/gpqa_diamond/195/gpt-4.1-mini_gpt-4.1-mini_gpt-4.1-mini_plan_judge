proposed answer: The problem involves finding the maximum speed v_max of a mass in a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator governed by Hooke's law. The key physical principle is conservation of total energy, which includes rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy stored in the spring. At maximum displacement x = A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so the total energy is E_total = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2. At the equilibrium position x = 0, the potential energy is zero and kinetic energy is maximal, so E_total = gamma m c^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2 / c^2) is the Lorentz factor. Equating these energies gives gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2, or gamma = 1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2). Solving for v_max yields v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2))^2). This expression respects the relativistic speed limit v_max < c and reduces to the classical maximum speed v_max = A sqrt(k/m) in the non-relativistic limit where (k A^2) / (2 m c^2) << 1. Among the given choices, only choice B) matches this derived expression exactly and is physically consistent. Choice A) has a plus sign inside the square root and a denominator that can cause singularities or unphysical speeds exceeding c. Choice C) is dimensionally inconsistent and lacks the speed of light squared in the denominator, making it invalid. Choice D) is purely classical and ignores relativistic effects, so it cannot be correct for the relativistic oscillator. Therefore, after careful analysis of energy conservation, relativistic constraints, dimensional consistency, and physical limits, choice B) is the correct and physically consistent formula for the maximum speed v_max of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.
