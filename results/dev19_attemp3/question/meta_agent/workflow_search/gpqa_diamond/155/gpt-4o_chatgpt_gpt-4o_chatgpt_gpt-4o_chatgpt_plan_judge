Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reactions involve the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid to form diols. The stereochemistry of the starting alkenes leads to different stereochemical outcomes in the products. (E)-oct-4-ene will form a meso diol, which is achiral, while (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a pair of enantiomers. In standard HPLC, which separates based on polarity, the meso compound and the racemic mixture may not be resolved into more than two peaks, as they may have similar polarity. Therefore, the standard HPLC will likely show 2 peaks: one for the meso diol and one for the racemic mixture. In chiral HPLC, the enantiomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene will be resolved into two separate peaks (R,R and S,S), while the meso compound will appear as a single peak, resulting in three peaks in total. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
