Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent E5jZ', content='The reactions involve the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid to form diols. The stereochemistry of the starting alkenes leads to different stereochemical outcomes in the products. (E)-oct-4-ene will form a meso diol, which is achiral, while (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a pair of enantiomers. In standard HPLC, which separates based on polarity, the meso compound and the racemic mixture may not be resolved into more than two peaks, as they may have similar polarity. Therefore, the standard HPLC will likely show 2 peaks: one for the meso diol and one for the racemic mixture. In chiral HPLC, the enantiomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene will be resolved into two separate peaks (R,R and S,S), while the meso compound will appear as a single peak, resulting in three peaks in total.

The (E)-isomer will form an epoxide with the epoxide ring on the same side as the larger substituents, while the (Z)-isomer will form an epoxide with the ring on the opposite side. Upon hydrolysis, these epoxides will open to form diols. The (E)-isomer will lead to a meso compound (achiral) because the substituents are on the same side, while the (Z)-isomer will lead to a pair of enantiomers because the substituents are on opposite sides. In standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, if the diastereomers have similar polarity, they may not be resolved, leading to fewer peaks. In chiral HPLC, which separates enantiomers, there will be more peaks due to the separation of the enantiomers from the (Z)-isomer.

Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a pair of enantiomers because the epoxide will be cis, leading to different stereocenters upon hydrolysis. In standard HPLC, which separates based on polarity, the meso diol and the racemic mixture may not be distinguished if they have similar polarity, resulting in 2 peaks.
