proposed answer: The problem requires ranking six monosubstituted benzene derivatives by increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. The key factors are the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (CH3) and ethyl (C2H5) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions. Among these, ethyl is bulkier than methyl, increasing steric hindrance at ortho positions and thus favoring para substitution more strongly. Halogens like chlorine (Cl) are deactivating but still ortho/para directing due to resonance; chlorine is smaller than alkyl groups but causes some steric hindrance at ortho positions, so it moderately favors para substitution. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (NO2), carboxyl (COOH), and ester (COOC2H5) deactivate the ring and direct substitution meta, resulting in low para-isomer yields. Among these, nitro is the strongest deactivator and thus expected to have the lowest para substitution. Carboxyl and ester groups are also meta directors but less strongly deactivating than nitro. Between carboxyl and ester, ester is less electron withdrawing, so ester should have a slightly higher para substitution than carboxyl. Combining these effects, the expected order of increasing para-isomer yield is: nitro (4) < carboxyl (6) < ester (2) < chlorine (3) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5). Comparing this with the given choices, choice B) '4<2<6<3<1<5' is the closest match, differing only in the order of ester (2) and carboxyl (6). Given the similar directing effects and steric factors of ester and carboxyl groups, this minor discrepancy is acceptable. Other choices show less consistent or reversed orders, making them less plausible. Therefore, choice B best matches the predicted ranking based on electronic and steric considerations influencing para substitution.

proposed answer: The problem requires ranking six monosubstituted benzene derivatives by the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. The substituents are methyl (CH3), ethyl (C2H5), chloro (Cl), nitro (NO2), carboxyl (COOH), and ester (COOC2H5). The key factors influencing the para-isomer yield are the electronic directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl and ethyl activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions, increasing para-isomer yield. Among these, ethyl is bulkier than methyl, which sterically hinders ortho substitution more, relatively increasing para substitution. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like nitro, carboxyl, and ester deactivate the ring and are meta directors, reducing para substitution. Among these, nitro is the strongest meta director, giving the lowest para fraction. Carboxyl and ester groups are also meta directors but differ in steric bulk; ester is bulkier than carboxyl, which slightly favors para substitution more due to steric hindrance of ortho positions. Halogens (Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance effects. Although chloro deactivates, it still favors para substitution more than meta directors but less than strong EDGs. Combining these insights, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield is nitro (4) < carboxyl (6) < ester (2) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5) < chloro (3). This order reflects the combined influence of electronic and steric effects on regioselectivity and matches choice D) '4<6<2<1<5<3'. This ranking is consistent with established organic chemistry principles and experimental observations of electrophilic aromatic substitution regioselectivity. All other choices do not align with these well-established principles and steric considerations. Therefore, choice D is the best and most accurate answer.
