proposed answer: We seek solutions (x,y) of
y = Y(x) = 4·g(f(sin2πx)),
 x = X(y) = 4·g(f(cos3πy))
on one fundamental domain of periodicity x∈[0,½], y∈[0,1/3].  From Sub‐task 3 we know: let A=|sin2πx|, B=|cos3πy|.  Then
  Y(x)=H(A),  X(y)=H(B),
where H(u)=4·| |u−½|−¼ | is a continuous “hat’’ with 4 linear pieces on u∈[0,1]:
  0≤u≤¼: H=1−4u    (slope −4)
  ¼≤u≤½: H=4u−1    (slope +4)
  ½≤u≤¾: H=3−4u    (slope −4)
  ¾≤u≤1: H=4u−3    (slope +4)
Hence Y(x) is piecewise linear in A (and thus in x) with 4 segments per half‐period, and X(y) likewise with 4 segments per third‐period.  Within the rectangle [0,½]×[0,1/3], Y(x) consists of 4 straight segments in x (on A‐intervals I₁…I₄) and X(y) consists of 4 straight segments in y (on B‐intervals J₁…J₄).  On each of the 4×4=16 subrectangles I_i×J_j, the two graphs are two nonparallel straight lines (one from y=Y(x), one from x=X(y)), so they intersect exactly once in that subrectangle.  None of these intersections falls on the boundary of the overall fundamental rectangle (since boundary‐cases at u=0,¼,½,¾,1 lead to H(u)=0 or 1, which would force x or y exactly at extremes and would lie on the edges of subintervals but not coincide in both equations except at corner identifications), so all 16 are distinct within [0,½]×[0,1/3].  By periodicity these 16 are the unique intersections per fundamental period.  Hence the total number of intersections in one fundamental domain is 16.

proposed answer: We need to identify all inner‐argument values p at which the piecewise‐linear maps f(t)=||t|–½| or g(w)=||w|–¼| switch linear branches when composed with t=sin(2πx) or t=cos(3πy).

Step 1: Find breakpoints of f(t).
 f(t)=||t|–½| has a corner whenever its inner absolute argument satisfies |t|–½=0 ⇒ |t|=½. Thus p=½ is critical for f.

Step 2: Find breakpoints of g(w).
 g(w)=||w|–¼| has a corner when |w|–¼=0 ⇒ |w|=¼. Thus p=¼ is critical for g.

Step 3: Determine when g(f(t)) switches at g’s corner.
 We solve f(t)=¼ ⇒ ||t|–½|=¼ ⇒ |t|–½=±¼ ⇒ |t|=½±¼ ⇒ |t|=¾ or |t|=¼. Thus p=¼ and p=¾ are critical values of |t|.

Step 4: Include domain endpoints of |t| when t arises from sin or cos.
 Since |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| both range from 0 to 1, the extremal values p=0 and p=1 also serve as boundaries of piecewise regions.

Step 5: Collect all distinct critical values:
 0 (domain start), ¼ (g‐corner and f’s output threshold), ½ (f‐corner), ¾ (f’s preimage of g‐corner), 1 (domain end).

Hence the complete set of inner‐argument breakpoint values is {0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1}.

Answer:0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1
