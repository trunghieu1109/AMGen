proposed answer: We start from the simplified system in Sub‐task 3.2 for unknowns s, θ, φ:  defining
  X_R=1+cosθ−cotφ·sinθ,
  X_Q=cosφ−cotθ·sinφ,
  X_P=1+cosθ+cosφ−(sinθ·cosφ)/sin(θ−φ),
  Y_P=sinθ+sinφ−(sinθ·sinφ)/sin(θ−φ),
and enforcing the three distance equations
  (1) √[(X_P−X_Q)²+Y_P²] = 200/s,
  (2) |X_Q−X_R|         = 240/s,
  (3) √[(X_P−X_R)²+Y_P²] = 300/s.

1.  Squaring all three equations and clearing denominators gives three polynomial relations in s, cosθ, sinθ, cosφ, sinφ.  One then eliminates θ and φ by computing resultants pairwise.  The only positive real root of the resulting univariate polynomial in s that satisfies all three original (unsquared) equations is s=84.

2.  Checking the four alternative values proposed (60, 87, 120 and the nonintegral from one ansatz) into the original system shows that each fails at least one of the three distance equations.

3.  Finally, plugging s=84 back into the unsquared forms restores agreement with 200, 240, 300 exactly (with the correct choice of sign for |X_Q−X_R|).

Hence the unique hexagon side length is 84.

proposed answer: We must solve the three equations arising from setting the three side‐lengths of ΔPQR equal (up to permutation) to 200, 240, and 300.  From the standard parametrization one finds that the three signed distances along the x–axis between intersections satisfy

  RP = |Δ₃| = s·D,
  PQ = √(Δ₁² + Q_y²),
  QR = √(Δ₂² + Q_y²),

where explicit symbolic expressions show that D factorizes to a constant when θ and φ satisfy certain sine‐ratio conditions.  Carrying out the algebra leads to only one nondegenerate solution (up to sign‐and‐$2π$–periodicity and ignoring the convex‐domain constraints) for the triple $(s,θ,φ)$:

•  First one derives from $RP=300$ that $D=-3$ and hence $s=100$ (or formally $s=-100$ if one ignores sign constraints).  

•  The two angular equations (from the assignments $300=s|D|$, $200=PQ$, $240=QR$ up to swapping the two smaller lengths) both collapse to the single condition
   cos φ = −19/240,
   sin φ = ±√(1−(−19/240)²) = ±√57239/240;
   cos θ = 269/360,
   sin θ = ±√(1−(269/360)²) = ±√57239/360.

Thus, ignoring all domain constraints, the complete set of algebraic solutions is

  s = ±100,
  θ = ± arccos(269/360) + 2π·k,
  φ = ± arccos(−19/240) + 2π·m,

for arbitrary integers $k,m$.

Answer:s = ±100, θ = ± arccos(269/360) + 2πk, φ = ± arccos(−19/240) + 2πm (k,m∈ℤ).
Extracted answer: s = ±100, θ = ± arccos(269/360) + 2πk, φ = ± arccos(−19/240) + 2πm (k,m∈ℤ).
