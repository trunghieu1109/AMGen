Reviewing the three chain‐of‐thought proposals, they all converge on the same vector‐model: fix v₁ along the x‐axis, let v₂ and v₃ be at angles θ and φ, and take v₄, v₅, v₆ as their negatives to enforce opposite‐side parallelism and automatic closure. This model is minimal (one length parameter, two angles), fully specifies all vertices, and its convexity follows exactly from the stated inequalities. Other proposed variations (reflections or different sign‐choices) either violate convexity or are equivalent up to rigid motion. Thus the most consistent, simplest, and fully justified model is: place A at (0,0); define the directed side‐vectors v₁,…,v₆ of length s by angles 0, θ, φ, π, θ+π, φ+π; and build the vertices by successive addition. The convexity, equilaterality, parallel‐oppose, and closure are immediate.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent gY1A:\nPlace A at the origin and let all sides have length s.

Each |vᵢ|=s, and opposite sides are parallel by v₄=−v₁, v₅=−v₂, v₆=−v₃.  The inequalities 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π guarantee that the turning angles at each vertex lie strictly between 0 and π, so ABCDEF is convex.\n\n### Sub-task 2.1: Choose a convenient coordinate system: place A at the origin, AB along the x-axis, and express successive vertices B, C, D, E, F in terms of s, θ, and φ.

Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.

Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5. Other sign‐choices (for example taking DE to point right) would violate convexity or reverse orientation.  Thus this is the unique convex orientation satisfying the given parallelism and equilaterality.; answer: Let s>0, choose angles satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  Then define vertices in the plane by\nA=(0,0),\nB=A+s(1,0)=(s,0),\nC=B+s(cosθ,sinθ),\nD=C+s(cosφ,sinφ),\nE=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+(−s,0),\nF=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+(−s\u2009cosθ,−s\u2009sinθ).\nOne checks F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π))=A, and AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA, with all sides of length s, yielding the required convex equilateral hexagon.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Xpi6, thinking: We are asked to give a coordinate or vector model for a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF of side length s, with opposite sides parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA, and to introduce two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. We must justify every step and discuss all possible cases.\n\n1. Vector approach to opposite‐side parallelism and equal length:\n   - Label the side vectors in order around the hexagon as v₁=AB, v₂=BC, v₃=CD, v₄=DE, v₅=EF, v₆=FA.\n   - Equilateral condition: |v_i|=s for i=1,…,6.\n   - Opposite sides parallel (and equal length) ⇒ v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n   - Hexagon closure ⇒ v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₅+v₆=0, which is automatically satisfied if v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n\n2. Reduce free parameters to two angles:\n   - We need three independent vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s in the plane. Up to rigid motions, we can fix v₁ along the positive x‐axis: v₁=(s,0).\n   - Parametrize v₂ by an angle θ measured CCW from v₁: v₂=(s cosθ, s sinθ).\n   - Parametrize v₃ by a second angle φ measured CCW from v₁: v₃=(s cosφ, s sinφ).\n\n3. Convexity constraints:\n   - The ordered turning angles at the vertices must be between 0 and π.  Since we go from v₁ to v₂ to v₃ in CCW order,\n     we require 0<θ<φ<π (so each turn is less than 180° in the positive sense) and φ−θ<π (so the interior at C is <180°).\n   - These inequalities ensure that all interior angles of the hexagon are <π and that the hexagon is convex.\n\n4. Determine the remaining vertices and sides:\n   - Then v₄=DE=–v₁=(–s,0), v₅=EF=–v₂=(–s cosθ, –s sinθ), v₆=FA=–v₃=(–s cosφ, –s sinφ).\n   - Choose A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅, and verify F+v₆=A.\n\n5. Discussion of other cases:\n   - The only other “case” would be reflecting the entire figure (replacing all angles by their negatives), which yields the same shape up to reflection.\n   - Swapping the order of θ and φ or reversing orientation would violate 0<θ<φ<π or convexity, so the above is the unique (up to rigid motion and reflection) model that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus we have a complete, detailed vector/coordinate model depending on s, θ, φ with the required parallelism and convexity.; answer: One convenient model is as follows.\n\nLet s>0 be the common side length. Introduce two angles 0<θ<φ<π with φ−θ<π.  Define the oriented side‐vectors of hexagon ABCDEF by:\n  v₁=AB=(s,0)\n  v₂=BC=(s\u2009cosθ,\u2009s\u2009sinθ)\n  v₃=CD=(s\u2009cosφ,\u2009s\u2009sinφ)\n  v₄=DE=−v₁=(−s,0)\n  v₅=EF=−v₂=(−s\u2009cosθ,\u2009−s\u2009sinθ)\n  v₆=FA=−v₃=(−s\u2009cosφ,\u2009−s\u2009sinφ)\n\nThen set A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅.  One checks F+v₆=(0,0)=A, so the hexagon closes.  Each |vᵢ|=s, and opposite sides are parallel by construction.  The inequalities on θ,φ guarantee all interior angles are less than π, so ABCDEF is convex.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent SDmH, round 0, thinking: We need a concrete, minimal parametrization of the convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s and opposite sides parallel.

Introduce two angles 0<θ<φ<π with φ−θ<π to guarantee all interior angles lie in (0,π) and hence convexity.  Define the first three directed edges by angles 0, θ, φ; the last three edges are their negatives to enforce parallelism and closure automatically.

Opposite sides must be parallel and equal, which we enforce by taking v₄=−v₁, v₅=−v₂, v₆=−v₃.  The angles 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π guarantee each internal turn is between 0 and π, ensuring convexity.

Thus φ=θ+α and sin(θ+α)= (5/6) sin θ.  That single scalar equation has two base solutions in [0,2π):\n   θ = θ₀  or θ = π−θ₀,   with θ₀≈52.9069°,\nand hence φ=θ₀+α or φ=π−θ₀+α respectively.  Finally s is determined by any one of the three distance‐formulas, e.g.\n  QR = s·(sin θ / sin (φ−θ)) =240  ⇒  s = 240·(sin (φ−θ)/sin θ).\nPlugging in gives s=s₀≈289.4.  Because we were told to ignore domain constraints, we adjoin all multiples of π.\n\nThus all solutions (s,θ,φ) come in two infinite families (k,ℓ∈ℤ):\n\n(1) θ = θ₀ + kπ,       φ = θ₀ + α + ℓπ,      s = s₀,\n(2) θ = π−θ₀ + kπ,  φ = π−θ₀ + α + ℓπ,  s = −s₀.\n\nHere θ₀≈52.9069°, α≈85.0°, and s₀ = 240·sin α / sin θ₀ ≈289.4.; answer: All candidate solutions (ignoring domain constraints) are given by two families, for any integers k,ℓ:  \n\n1) θ = θ₀ + kπ,   φ = θ₀ + α + ℓπ,   s = 240·sin α / sin θ₀,  \n2) θ = π−θ₀ + kπ,   φ = π−θ₀ + α + ℓπ,   s = −240·sin α / sin θ₀,  \n\nwhere θ₀≈52.9069°, α≈85.0° (the angle of the 200–240–300 triangle), and hence s₀=240·sin α/sin θ₀≈289.4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Ha8S, round 0, thinking: We must solve the three equations arising from setting the three side‐lengths of ΔPQR equal (up to permutation) to 200, 240, and 300.  From the standard parametrization one finds that the three signed distances along the x–axis between intersections satisfy\n\n  RP = |Δ₃| = s·D,\n  PQ = √(Δ₁² + Q_y²),\n  QR = √(Δ₂² + Q_y²),\n\nwhere explicit symbolic expressions show that D factorizes to a constant when θ and φ satisfy certain sine‐ratio conditions.  Carrying out the algebra leads to only one nondegenerate solution (up to sign‐and‐$2π$–periodicity and ignoring the convex‐domain constraints) for the triple $(s,θ,φ)$:\n\n•  First one derives from $RP=300$ that $D=-3$ and hence $s=100$ (or formally $s=-100$ if one ignores sign constraints).  \n\n•  The two angular equations (from the assignments $300=s|D|$, $200=PQ$, $240=QR$ up to swapping the two smaller lengths) both collapse to the single condition\n   cos\u2009φ = −19/240,\n   sin\u2009φ = ±√(1−(−19/240)²) = ±√57239/240;\n   cos\u2009θ = 269/360,\n   sin\u2009θ = ±√(1−(269/360)²) = ±√57239/360.\n\nThus, ignoring all domain constraints, the complete set of algebraic solutions is\n\n  s = ±100,\n  θ = ± arccos(269/360) + 2π·k,\n  φ = ± arccos(−19/240) + 2π·m,\n\nfor arbitrary integers $k,m$.; answer: s = ±100, θ = ± arccos(269/360) + 2πk, φ = ± arccos(−19/240) + 2πm (k,m∈ℤ).', iteration_idx=0)]
