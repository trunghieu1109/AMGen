Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We have x1=9, x2=9, x3=9 for the column sums and S1=8, S2=19 for the row sums. Label the grid entries as a11,a12,a13 in row 1 and a21,a22,a23 in row 2. The constraints are:
1) a11+a21=9, a12+a22=9, a13+a23=9  (column sums)
2) a11+a12+a13=8  (first row sum)
3) a21+a22+a23=19 (second row sum)
4) each aij is an integer between 0 and 9.
From (1) we get a21=9−a11, a22=9−a12, a23=9−a13. Substituting into (3) gives (9−a11)+(9−a12)+(9−a13)=27−(a11+a12+a13)=19 ⇒ a11+a12+a13=8, which is the same as (2). Thus the only independent constraint is a11+a12+a13=8 with 0≤aij≤9. Since 8≤9, the upper bound is never active. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.

proposed answer: We need to carry out Sub‐task 4: for each S1 in {8, 18}, we enumerate all nonnegative digit triples (a11,a12,a13) summing to S1 (with each ≤9), set a2j=9−a1j, check 0≤a2j≤9, and count the resulting assignments.

Case S1=8:
– We seek nonnegative solutions to a11+a12+a13=8 with each ≤9. Since 8<10, the upper‐bound constraints are inactive. The count is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.
– For each of these 45 triples, define a2j=9−a1j. Because a1j∈[0,8], a2j∈[1,9], so all 0≤a2j≤9 hold. Thus all 45 are valid.

Case S1=18:
– We seek nonnegative solutions to a11+a12+a13=18 with each ≤9. Without upper bounds the count is C(18+3−1,2)=C(20,2)=190.
– Subtract those with some a1j≥10. For any fixed j, set bj = a1j−10≥0, then bj + sum of the other two =8, giving C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45. There are 3 choices of j, so subtract 3·45=135. No solution has two variables ≥10 since then the sum of the remaining variable would be negative. Thus the valid count is 190−135=55.
– For each of these 55 triples, a2j=9−a1j∈[0,9] (since a1j≤9), so all constraints are met.

Total assignments =45+55=100.

Answer:For S1=8: 45 triples. For S1=18: 55 triples. Total assignments = 100.
