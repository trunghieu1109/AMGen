All three correctly use the fact that each tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency and arrive at the same D = (9/2, -27√14/11). However, the TLuz version gives the tangent equations in integer‐coefficient form, which is the cleanest and most consistent representation. Step‐by‐step: 1. Center O = (9/2, 33√14/56). 2. Radius vector OB = B – O = (–9/2, –33√14/56). Dot‐product with any tangent direction (x,y) yields (–9/2)x + (–33√14/56)y = 0 ⇒ multiply by 56: –252x – 33√14 y = 0 ⇒ 252x + 33√14 y = 0 ⇒ divide by 3: 84x + 11√14 y = 0. 3. Radius vector OC = C – O = (9/2, –33√14/56).

We choose the positive value for a concrete orientation, noting the mirror case simply flips signs of all y-coordinates.\n\nNext, the circumcenter O is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors of BC and AB (or any two sides). The bisector of BC is the vertical line x=4.5. For AB:\n Midpoint M_AB=((0+1/3)/2,\n                            (0+4√14/3)/2) = (1/6,2√14/3).\n Slope of AB is (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14, so its perpendicular slope is −1/(4√14). The line through M_AB of that slope:\n  y−2√14/3 = −1/(4√14)(x−1/6).\nIntersecting with x=4.5=9/2 gives\n y = 2√14/3 − (1/(4√14))*(9/2−1/6) = 2√14/3 − (1/(4√14))*(13/3)\n    = (112/(12√14)−13/(12√14)) = 99/(12√14) = 33/(4√14) = 33√14/56.\nSo O=(9/2,33√14/56) (or with a negative y for the mirror case).\n\nFinally, the circumradius R can be found by R=abc/(4Δ), where a=BC=9, b=CA=10, c=AB=5, and Δ is the area. By Heron’s formula: s=(5+9+10)/2=12, Δ=√[12·7·2·3]=√504=6√14. Hence R= (5·9·10)/(4·6√14)=450/(24√14)=75/(4√14)=75√14/56.\n\nThus the coordinates and circle are completely determined.; answer: Chosen orientation: B=(0,0), C=(9,0), A=(1/3,4√14/3). Circumcenter O=(9/2,33√14/56). Radius R=75√14/56.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Q4Hx, computing coords and circumcenter, thinking: We need to choose a coordinate system that makes computing A, B, C simple, then find the circumcenter O and radius R by intersecting perpendicular bisectors. Steps:\n\n1. Place B at (0,0) and C at (9,0).  Then BC=9 is satisfied.\n2. Let A=(x,y).  We impose AB=5: x^2+y^2=25  ……(1), and AC=10: (x-9)^2+y^2=100  ……(2).\n3. Subtract (1) from (2): (x-9)^2–x^2=100–25 → x^2–18x+81–x^2=75 → –18x=–6 → x=1/3.\n4. From (1): (1/3)^2+y^2=25 → y^2=25–1/9=(224/9) → y=±(4√14/3).  Choose y>0 to get a nondegenerate triangle: A=(1/3, 4√14/3).\n\nNow we have A, B, C.  Next, find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC by intersecting two perpendicular bisectors:\n\n5. Perp. bisector of BC: B(0,0), C(9,0) → midpoint M₁=(4.5,0), line x=4.5.\n6. Perp. bisector of AB: A(1/3,4√14/3), B(0,0) → midpoint M₂=(1/6,2√14/3).  Slope AB = (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14 → perp. slope = –1/(4√14) = –√14/56.  Eqn: y–(2√14/3)= (–√14/56)(x–1/6).\n7. Plug x=4.5 into this bisector: x–1/6=13/3 ⇒ RHS=–(√14/56)*(13/3)=–13√14/168.  Thus y = 2√14/3 –13√14/168 = (112√14 –13√14)/168 = (99√14)/168 = (33√14)/56.\n8. Therefore O = (4.5, 33√14/56) = (9/2, 33√14/56).\n\nFinally compute R = distance OB = sqrt((9/2)^2 + (33√14/56)^2).\n9. (9/2)^2=81/4 =4536/224.  (33√14/56)^2 =1089*14/3136 =15246/3136 =1089/224.  Sum = (4536+1089)/224 =5625/224 = (75^2)/(224).  So R =75/√224 =75/(4√14) =75√14/56.\n\nThus the circumcircle ω has center O=(9/2, 33√14/56) and radius R=75√14/56.; answer: We may choose B=(0,0), C=(9,0), and A=(1/3, 4√14/3).  The circumcenter is O=(9/2, 33√14/56) and the circumradius is R=75√14/56.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Gthm, computing coords and circumcenter, thinking: We want coordinates for triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. A convenient choice is to place B at the origin and C on the x-axis. 1. Set B=(0,0), C=(9,0). 2. Let A=(x,y).  We impose distances:\n   • AB=5 gives x^2 + y^2 =25,  (1)\n   • AC=10 gives (x−9)^2 + y^2 =100. (2)\nSubtract (1) from (2): (x−9)^2 − x^2 =75 → x^2 −18x +81 − x^2 =75 → −18x = −6 → x = 1/3.\nThen y^2 =25 − (1/3)^2 =25 −1/9 =224/9, so y = ±(4√14)/3.  We choose the positive y to avoid degeneracy: A=(1/3, 4√14/3).\n\nNext find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.  The circumcenter is intersection of perpendicular bisectors of sides.\n • Perp. bisector of BC: BC midpoint M_BC = (4.5,0), BC is horizontal, so this bisector is the vertical line x=4.5.\n • Perp. bisector of AB: AB midpoint M_AB = ((0 +1/3)/2, (0+4√14/3)/2) = (1/6, 2√14/3).  Slope of AB is (4√14/3)/(1/3)=4√14, so its perpendicular slope is −1/(4√14).  The bisector line passes through M_AB.\nIntersecting with x=4.5 gives O_x=4.5.  Then O_y satisfies\n   O_y − 2√14/3 = [−1/(4√14)]·(4.5 − 1/6) = −(13/3)/(4√14) = −13/(12√14).\nHence O_y = 2√14/3 − 13/(12√14) = (8√14 −13/√14)/12 = 99/(12√14) = 33/(4√14).\nSo O = (9/2, 33/(4√14)).\n\nFinally the circumradius R = distance OB = √[(4.5)^2 + (33/(4√14))^2]\n   = √[20.25 + 1089/(224)] = √[(4536 +1089)/224] = √[5625/224] =75/(4√14).; answer: B = (0,0),  C = (9,0),  A = \\bigl(\\tfrac13, \\tfrac{4\\sqrt{14}}3\\bigr).

To find the tangent at B, we note that the radius OB is perpendicular to the tangent. Thus any point (x,y) on the tangent at B satisfies OB·(P−B)=0. We compute OB = B−O = (−9/2, −33√14/56). The dot‐product condition gives (−9/2)x + (−33√14/56)y = 0, which simplifies to 84x + 11√14 y = 0.

Parameterize line AD: direction v = D - A = (25/6, -125√14/33).  So any point = A + t⋅v: x = 1/3 + (25/6)t, y = 4√14/3 - (125√14/33)t. 2. Compute Δx = x - 9/2 = (25/6)(t - 1).  Compute Δy = y - 33√14/56 = 125√14⋅(33 - 168t)/5544. 3. Plug into circle: (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 = 78750/3136.  Factor out to get a quadratic in t.  Noting t=0 corresponds to A, the equation has roots t=0 and t=t2, so t2 = 88/169. 4. Compute P = A + (88/169)v:  xP = 1/3 + (88/169)(25/6) = 423/169,  yP = 4√14/3 - (88/169)(125√14/33) = -108√14/169. 5. Thus the second intersection is P = (423/169, -108√14/169).; answer: P = (423/169, -108√14/169)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent bM8v, finding P, thinking: We seek the second intersection P≠A of line AD with circle ω.  We know: A=(1/3,4√14/3), D=(9/2,−27√14/11), and ω: (x−9/2)²+(y−33√14/56)²=78750/3136.\n\n1.  Parametrize AD:  Let A correspond to t=0, D to t=1:  \n   v=D−A=(25/6,−125√14/33).  Then (x,y)=A+t·v.\n2.  The line meets ω at t=0 (point A) and at t=P_t.  To find P_t use the “power‐of‐a‐point” method:\n   Since D lies outside ω, the secant through D meets ω at P (first) and A (second), so DP·DA=DB², where DB is the tangent length.\n\n   • DB² = (9/2)²+(−27√14/11)² =81/4+ (729·14)/121 =50625/484.\n   • DA = |D−A| = √[(25/6)²+(125√14/33)²] =325/22.\n   • Hence DP = DB²/DA = (50625/484)/(325/22) =2025/286.\n\n   Since D→P→A in that order, and our parametrization has A at t=0 and D at t=1 along v, the fraction of AD from A to P is t =1−(DP/DA) =1−( (2025/286)/(325/22) ) =1−(81/169)=88/169.\n\n3.

Then\n   AP² = (Δx)² + (Δy)²\n         = (1100/507)² + (1000√14/507)²\n         = [1100² +1000²·14] /507²\n         = (1 210 000 +14 000 000)/257049\n         =15 210 000/257049.\n4. Note 15 210 000 =1521·10 000 =39²·100², so\n   AP = √(15 210 000)/507 = (39·100)/507 =3900/507 =1300/169.\n5.

We need AP = distance between A and P.\n\n1. Compute Δx = x_P – x_A = 423/169 – 1/3.\n   Common denominator = 169·3 = 507.\n   423/169 = (423·3)/507 = 1269/507.\n   1/3    = (1·169)/507 = 169/507.\n   Δx = (1269 – 169)/507 = 1100/507.\n\n2. Compute Δy = y_P – y_A = (–108√14/169) – (4√14/3).\n   Factor out √14: Δy = √14·[–108/169 – 4/3].\n   Write with denominator 507: –108/169 = (–108·3)/507 = –324/507.\n                             4/3    = (4·169)/507 = 676/507.\n   Sum: –324/507 – 676/507 = –1000/507.\n   Δy = –1000√14/507.\n\n3. Compute (Δx)² + (Δy)²:\n   (1100/507)² + (–1000√14/507)²\n   = [1100² + (1000²·14)] / 507²\n   = [1 210 000 + 14 000 000] / 257 049\n   = 15 210 000 / 257 049.\n\n4. Therefore AP = √(15 210 000 / 257 049) = √15 210 000 / 507.\n   Notice 15 210 000 = 1521·10 000, and √1521 = 39, √10 000 = 100,\n   so √15 210 000 = 39·100 = 3900.\n   Thus AP = 3900/507.\n\n5.
