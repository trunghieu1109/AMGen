Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the length of AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle, using properties of symmedians and the power of a point theorem. The solution provided by the agents determined that AP = 45/8, which is already in its simplest form. This means m = 45 and n = 8 are relatively prime integers. To find the sum m + n, we add these two numbers together: 45 + 8 = 53. All agents agree on this calculation, and there are no other cases or complications mentioned that would affect this result.

proposed answer: To find the length of AP, we need to use the properties of the symmedian and the fact that AD is the symmedian in triangle ABC. In a triangle, the symmedian is related to the sides of the triangle and the circumcircle. We have triangle ABC with sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, making AD the symmedian. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, AP/PD = (AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2) / (AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2) = (5^2 + 10^2 - 9^2) / (5^2 + 10^2 - 9^2) = (25 + 100 - 81) / (25 + 100 - 81) = 44/44 = 1. This means AP = PD. Since AD = AP + PD and AD is the symmedian, we can use the symmedian length formula: AD^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 * AB * AC * cos(A). We find cos(A) using the cosine rule: cos(A) = (AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2) / (2 * AB * AC) = (25 + 100 - 81) / (2 * 5 * 10) = 44/100 = 0.44. Then AD^2 = 25 + 100 - 2 * 5 * 10 * 0.44 = 125 - 44 = 81. So AD = sqrt(81) = 9. Since AP = PD and AD = AP + PD, we have 2AP = 9, so AP = 9/2. Therefore, AP = 9/2, and m + n = 9 + 2 = 11.

proposed answer: To express AP in the form of a fraction m/n, we need to ensure that the expression is simplified and verified. From the previous sub-task, we found that AP = sqrt(10)/2. This is already in the form of a fraction where m = 10 and n = 2. The fraction is simplified because sqrt(10) is in its simplest radical form and 2 is the smallest integer denominator. Therefore, m + n = 10 + 2 = 12. This matches the answer provided in the previous sub-task, confirming that the expression is correct and simplified.
