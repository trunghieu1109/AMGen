Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We have from Subtask 1.2 the agreed coordinates of A and P as:
A = (1/3, 4√14/3),
P = (423/169, –108√14/169).
To find AP and hence m+n, proceed step-by-step:

1. Compute Δx = x_P – x_A:
   x_P = 423/169,  x_A = 1/3.
   Common denominator = 169·3 = 507.
   423/169 = 1269/507,  1/3 = 169/507.
   Δx = (1269 – 169)/507 = 1100/507.

2. Compute Δy = y_P – y_A:
   y_P = –108√14/169,  y_A = 4√14/3.
   Factor out √14 and use denominator 507:
   –108/169 = –324/507,  4/3 = 676/507.
   Sum = (–324 – 676)/507 = –1000/507,
   so Δy = –1000√14/507.

3. Compute AP² = (Δx)² + (Δy)²:
   (1100/507)² + (–1000√14/507)²
   = [1100² + 1000²·14] / 507²
   = (1 210 000 + 14 000 000) / 257 049
   = 15 210 000 / 257 049.

4. Take the square root:
   AP = √(15 210 000 / 257 049)
      = √15 210 000 / 507.
   Factor inside the radical: 15 210 000 = 1521 · 10 000, so
   √15 210 000 = 39 · 100 = 3900.
   Thus AP = 3900/507.

5. Simplify 3900/507:
   3900 = 3 · 13 · 100,  507 = 3 · 13 · 13.
   Cancel 3 and 13: = 100/13.

6. We have AP = m/n with m = 100, n = 13 in lowest terms.
   Therefore m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.
