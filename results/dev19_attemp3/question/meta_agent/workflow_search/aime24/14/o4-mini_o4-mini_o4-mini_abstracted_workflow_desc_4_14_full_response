Express cosh²v in terms of sinh²v via the identity cosh²v − sinh²v = 1.  Hence\n   cosh²v = sinh²v + 1.\n\n3.

The diagonal BD of the rhombus passes through the origin and goes from B to D=−B, so BD² = |B−(−B)|² = |2B|² = 4\u2009|B|².

Diagonals bisect at the origin: In any parallelogram the diagonals meet at their common midpoint.

Parallelogram to rhombus: With C=–A and D=–B the quadrilateral ABCD is automatically a parallelogram. To upgrade to a rhombus we require all sides equal in length.  \n   • Adjacent side vectors are A–B and B–C.  Since C=–A, B–C = B–(–A) = A + B.  \n   • Equate lengths: |A–B| = |A + B|.  \n   • Square both sides: (A–B)·(A–B) = (A + B)·(A + B).

Here cosh\u2009t ≥ 1 and sinh\u2009t runs over all real values, so this covers both branches: the choice of sign in x tells you left (−) or right (+).\n\n2. Choice of parameters for A and B:\n   Let\n      A = (  √20\u2009cosh\u2009u,  √24\u2009sinh\u2009u ),\n      B = (  sgn_x\u2009√20\u2009cosh\u2009v,  √24\u2009sinh\u2009v ),\n   where sgn_x = +1 if B is on the right branch (x>0) or −1 if on the left branch (x<0).\n\n3.

Rearrangement to coth-product:\n   Both sinh\u2009t and cosh\u2009t are nonzero for real t (cosh\u2009t≥1, sinh\u2009t≠0 except at t=0, but u or v=0 would violate A·B=0).  Divide both sides by 4\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v:\n      sgn_x·(20/4)(1/(sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v)) = (24/4)(1/(cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v))\n      ⇒ sgn_x·5\u2009/(sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v) = 6\u2009/(cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v)\n      ⇒ (cosh\u2009u/sinh\u2009u)·(cosh\u2009v/sinh\u2009v) = sgn_x·6/5\n      ⇒ coth\u2009u · coth\u2009v = sgn_x·6/5.\n\n5. Absorbing branch sign into parameters:\n   • If B is on the same branch as A (sgn_x = +1), we get coth\u2009u\u2009coth\u2009v = +6/5.\n   • If B is on the opposite branch (sgn_x = −1), then coth\u2009u\u2009coth\u2009v = −6/5.  But note coth(−v) = −coth\u2009v, so replacing v by −v converts the negative case back to coth\u2009u\u2009coth(−v) = +6/5.  Since u and v range freely over all real values, we can always choose their signs so that the final algebraic relation reads the same.\n\nConclusion: In every case—whether A and B lie on the same or opposite branches—one can write the orthogonality condition succinctly as\n   coth\u2009u · coth\u2009v = 6/5.; answer - coth(u)*coth(v)=6/5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We seek BD² in terms of the parameter v.

No other cases alter the algebraic derivation.\n; answer: Parametrization:\nA = (√20\u2009cosh u,\u2009√24\u2009sinh u),  B = (√20\u2009cosh v,\u2009√24\u2009sinh v).\nDot‐product zero gives:\n20\u2009cosh u\u2009cosh v − 24\u2009sinh u\u2009sinh v = 0,\nwhich simplifies to\ncoth u · coth v = 6/5.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent EZyI, round 0, parametrizing orthogonality, thinking: We want to parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 and then impose the orthogonality condition A·B=0.  \n\n1. Standard parametrization of the right‐branch hyperbola x^2/a^2 – y^2/b^2 = 1 is x = a\u2009cosh t, y = b\u2009sinh t.  Here a = √20, b = √24.  So we set\n   A = (√20\u2009cosh\u2009u,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009u),\n   B = (√20\u2009cosh\u2009v,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009v),\nfor real parameters u, v.  \n\n2. Compute the Euclidean dot product A·B:\n   A·B = (√20\u2009cosh\u2009u)(√20\u2009cosh\u2009v) − (√24\u2009sinh\u2009u)(√24\u2009sinh\u2009v)\n        = 20\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v − 24\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v.  \n\n3. The rhombus condition requires A·B = 0.  Hence\n   20\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v − 24\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v = 0.\n\n4. Factor out 4 and rearrange:\n   5\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v = 6\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v\n   ⇒ (cosh\u2009u/sinh\u2009u)·(cosh\u2009v/sinh\u2009v) = 6/5\n   ⇒ coth\u2009u · coth\u2009v = 6/5.\n\n5. Discussion of cases:\n   • We have assumed both A and B on the same (right) branch so x = +√20\u2009cosh\u2009t>0.  Then cosh\u2009t>0 and sinh\u2009t can be ± but the ratio coth\u2009t = cosh\u2009t/sinh\u2009t is well‐defined (≠0).  In that case coth\u2009u and coth\u2009v are real and nonzero, so coth\u2009u\u2009coth\u2009v=6/5 has real solutions with u,v≠0.  \n   • If one or both points lie on the left branch (x<0), one would introduce a minus sign in the x‐coordinate: x=–√20\u2009cosh\u2009t.  Then the orthogonality equation becomes ±20\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v−24\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v=0, leading to coth\u2009u\u2009coth\u2009v=±6/5.  However, coth\u2009t is positive for t>0 and negative for t<0, so the sign of the product can be absorbed into a sign choice of u or v.  Hence one still arrives at the same relationship up to sign conventions.  \n\nConclusion: The parametrization and orthogonality condition are correctly given by\n   A=(√20\u2009cosh\u2009u,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009u),\n   B=(√20\u2009cosh\u2009v,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009v),\n   A·B=0 ⟹ 20\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v−24\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v=0 ⟹ coth\u2009u·coth\u2009v=6/5.; answer: Parametrizing A and B by A=(√20\u2009cosh\u2009u,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009u) and B=(√20\u2009cosh\u2009v,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009v), the condition A·B=0 becomes 20\u2009cosh\u2009u\u2009cosh\u2009v−24\u2009sinh\u2009u\u2009sinh\u2009v=0, which is equivalent to coth\u2009u·coth\u2009v=6/5.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent uHjm, computing BD^2, thinking: We seek BD² in terms of the parameter v.  Here B=(±√20\u2009cosh\u2009v,\u2009√24\u2009sinh\u2009v) lies on the hyperbola x²/20−y²/24=1.  \n\n1. Compute |B|², the square of the distance from the origin to B.  Since the sign on x does not affect the norm, we have\n   |B|² = (√20\u2009cosh\u2009v)² + (√24\u2009sinh\u2009v)²\n          = 20\u2009cosh²v + 24\u2009sinh²v.\n\n2. Express cosh²v in terms of sinh²v via the identity cosh²v − sinh²v = 1.  Hence\n   cosh²v = sinh²v + 1.\n\n3. Substitute into |B|²:\n   |B|² = 20\u2009(sinh²v + 1) + 24\u2009sinh²v\n          = 20 + 20\u2009sinh²v + 24\u2009sinh²v\n          = 20 + 44\u2009sinh²v.\n\n4. The diagonal BD of the rhombus passes through the origin and goes from B to D=−B, so BD² = |B−(−B)|² = |2B|² = 4\u2009|B|².  Therefore\n   BD² = 4\u2009(20 + 44\u2009sinh²v)\n        = 80 + 176\u2009sinh²v.\n\nThis derivation holds regardless of the sign choice for the x‐coordinate of B, since only its square enters the norm.; answer: 80 + 176 sinh^2 v\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent sUTB, feedback: The derivation is correct. Starting from B = (±√20\u2009cosh v,\u2009√24\u2009sinh v), we get |B|² = 20\u2009cosh²v + 24\u2009sinh²v. Using cosh²v = sinh²v + 1 gives |B|² = 20 + 44\u2009sinh²v, and then BD² = 4|B|² = 80 + 176\u2009sinh²v.

Note that sinh²v is strictly increasing in v>0, hence BD² is strictly increasing in v.  Thus the greatest lower bound (infimum) occurs as v→arccoth(6/5)^+.  Let c=arccoth(6/5), so coth\u2009c=6/5.  Then coth²c−1=sinh^{-2}c ⇒ sinh²c=1/(coth²c−1)=(1)/((36/25)−1)=25/11.  Therefore inf\u2009BD²=80+176·(25/11)=80+4400/11=80+400=480.; answer: 480', iteration_idx=-1)]
