Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We need to minimize BD²=4(20+44 sinh²v)=80+176 sinh²v over all v>arccoth(6/5) satisfying no further v–dependence.  Note that sinh²v is strictly increasing in v>0, hence BD² is strictly increasing in v.  Thus the greatest lower bound (infimum) occurs as v→arccoth(6/5)^+.  Let c=arccoth(6/5), so coth c=6/5.  Then coth²c−1=sinh^{-2}c ⇒ sinh²c=1/(coth²c−1)=(1)/((36/25)−1)=25/11.  Therefore inf BD²=80+176·(25/11)=80+4400/11=80+400=480.
