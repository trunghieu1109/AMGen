Step-by-step: 1. The highest power of 2 less than or equal to 2024 is 2^10 = 1024. Since 1024 ≤ 2024, the bit in position 10 is 1. Subtract: 2024 − 1024 = 1000. 2. Next, 2^9 = 512 ≤ 1000, so the bit in position 9 is 1. Subtract: 1000 − 512 = 488. 3. 2^8 = 256 ≤ 488, so bit 8 = 1. Subtract: 488 − 256 = 232. 4. 2^7 = 128 ≤ 232, so bit 7 = 1. Subtract: 232 − 128 = 104. 5. 2^6 = 64 ≤ 104, so bit 6 = 1. Subtract: 104 − 64 = 40. 6. 2^5 = 32 ≤ 40, so bit 5 = 1. Subtract: 40 − 32 = 8. 7. 2^4 = 16 > 8, so bit 4 = 0; remainder stays 8. 8. 2^3 = 8 ≤ 8, so bit 3 = 1. Subtract: 8 − 8 = 0. 9. With remainder 0, all lower bits (2^2, 2^1, 2^0) are 0.
