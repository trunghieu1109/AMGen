Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_17_26
proposed answer: Step 1: Recall from Sub-task 3 that A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.
Step 2: List the elements clearly: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
Step 3: Compute their sum:
  4 + 6 = 10
 10 + 7 = 17
 17 + 8 = 25
 25 + 9 = 34
 34 + 10 = 44
 44 + 11 = 55
Step 4: No other cases or configurations arise, since A was uniquely determined. Thus the sum is 55.

Answer:55
