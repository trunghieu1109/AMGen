Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^(a_i - 1) for each a_i in A equals 2024. This is equivalent to expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. The binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000, which corresponds to the powers of 2: 2^10, 2^9, 2^8, 2^7, 2^6, and 2^4. Each power of 2 corresponds to an element a_i in A such that 2^(a_i - 1) = 2^k, where k is the position of the 1 in the binary representation. Thus, for each power of 2, we have a_i = k + 1. Therefore, the elements of A are 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, and 5. Adding these elements gives us the sum: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 50. This reasoning is consistent across all agents' analyses, confirming the correctness of the solution.
