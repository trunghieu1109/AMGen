Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We have x=2^{a}, y=2^{b}, z=2^{c} with a=-7/24, b=-3/8, c=-5/12.
We want L = |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|.
Compute each term:
4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -7/6 = -28/24,
3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24,
2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -5/6 = -20/24.
Sum: 4a+3b+2c = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8.
Absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.
Thus m=25, n=8 and the simplified value is 25/8.

proposed answer: The goal is to output only the integer result in the “answer” field and nothing else. Steps and pitfalls checked:
1. Confirmed the final computed value for m+n is 33, so the required answer is the integer 33.
2. Ensured that the JSON object has exactly two keys: “thinking” and “answer.”
3. Verified that “answer” is provided as a raw integer, not as a string, and that there are no extra characters, quotes, or formatting around it.
4. Checked for common JSON mistakes: no trailing commas, all keys in double quotes, proper braces.
5. Confirmed no additional fields or commentary appear outside the specified JSON structure.
Having addressed these potential issues, the output below is valid and meets the requirement of returning only an integer in the answer.
