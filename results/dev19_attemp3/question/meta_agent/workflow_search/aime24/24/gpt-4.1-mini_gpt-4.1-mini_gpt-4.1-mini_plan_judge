Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, the value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) was calculated as -25/8. Taking the absolute value gives |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8. The fraction 25/8 is already in simplest form because 25 and 8 have no common factors other than 1 (25 = 5^2 and 8 = 2^3). Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8. The problem asks for m + n, which is 25 + 8 = 33. Multiple independent agents have confirmed this result, reinforcing its correctness.
