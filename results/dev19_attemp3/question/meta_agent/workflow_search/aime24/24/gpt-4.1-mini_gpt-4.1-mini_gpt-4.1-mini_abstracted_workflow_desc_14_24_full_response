We need to find log2(x^4 y^3 z^2). Using the logarithm power rule, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z). Substituting the values, we get 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12).

The given system of equations involves logarithms base 2 of ratios of these variables, establishing multiplicative relationships between x, y, and z. By rewriting the logarithmic equations in terms of log_2(x), log_2(y), and log_2(z), the problem reduces to a system of linear equations in these logarithmic variables.

Applying this to each equation, we get x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), y/(xz) = 2^(1/3), and z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). Next, to convert these into a linear system, we use the logarithm properties: log_2(a/b) = log_2(a) - log_2(b) and log_2(abc) = log_2(a) + log_2(b) + log_2(c). Defining X = log_2(x), Y = log_2(y), and Z = log_2(z), each original equation becomes a linear equation: X - Y - Z = 1/2, -X + Y - Z = 1/3, and -X - Y + Z = 1/4. This transformation is consistent and precise because it converts the nonlinear logarithmic system into a linear algebraic system, which is easier to analyze and solve.

To solve this system, we can add all three equations to eliminate variables and find relationships. Adding all three: (X - Y - Z) + (-X + Y - Z) + (-X - Y + Z) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. On the left side, X - Y - Z - X + Y - Z - X - Y + Z simplifies to -X - Y - Z. On the right side, 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12. So, -X - Y - Z = 13/12, or X + Y + Z = -13/12. Next, use the first equation: X - Y - Z = 1/2. Adding this to X + Y + Z = -13/12 gives 2X = 1/2 - 13/12 = (6/12) - (13/12) = -7/12, so X = -7/24. Similarly, subtract the second equation from the sum: (X + Y + Z) - (-X + Y - Z) = -13/12 - 1/3. Left side: X + Y + Z + X - Y + Z = 2X + 2Z. Right side: -13/12 - 4/12 = -17/12. We already know X = -7/24, so 2(-7/24) + 2Z = -17/12, which is -7/12 + 2Z = -17/12, so 2Z = -10/12 = -5/6, and Z = -5/12. Finally, subtract the third equation from the sum: (X + Y + Z) - (-X - Y + Z) = -13/12 - 1/4. Left side: X + Y + Z + X + Y - Z = 2X + 2Y. Right side: -13/12 - 3/12 = -16/12 = -4/3. Substitute X = -7/24: 2(-7/24) + 2Y = -4/3, so -7/12 + 2Y = -4/3, 2Y = -4/3 + 7/12 = (-16/12 + 7/12) = -9/12 = -3/4, so Y = -3/8.

We already know X = -7/24, so 2(-7/24) + 2Z = -17/12, which is -7/12 + 2Z = -17/12, so 2Z = -10/12 = -5/6, and Z = -5/12. Finally, subtract the third equation from the sum: (X + Y + Z) - (-X - Y + Z) = -13/12 - 1/4. Left side: X + Y + Z + X + Y - Z = 2X + 2Y. Right side: -13/12 - 3/12 = -16/12 = -4/3. Substitute X = -7/24: 2(-7/24) + 2Y = -4/3, so -7/12 + 2Y = -4/3, 2Y = -4/3 + 7/12 = (-16/12 + 7/12) = -9/12 = -3/4, so Y = -3/8. Therefore, the solutions are X = -7/24, Y = -3/8, and Z = -5/12.; answer: {'log2(x)': '-7/24', 'log2(y)': '-3/8', 'log2(z)': '-5/12'}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent h8BX, computing target log value, thinking: We are given the values of log2(x), log2(y), and log2(z) as -7/24, -3/8, and -5/12 respectively. We need to find log2(x^4 y^3 z^2). Using the logarithm power rule, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z). Substituting the values, we get 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculating each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now, summing these: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 24. Convert each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Simplify -75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.

Taking the absolute value gives |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8. The fraction 25/8 is already in simplest form because 25 and 8 have no common factors other than 1 (25 = 5^2 and 8 = 2^3).
