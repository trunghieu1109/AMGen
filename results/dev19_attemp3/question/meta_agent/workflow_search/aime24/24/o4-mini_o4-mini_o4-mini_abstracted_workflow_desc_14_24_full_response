The problem statement begins: “Let x, y and z be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: ….” From this we conclude the variables of interest are x, y, and z. The text then lists three equations, each of the form log₂(expression)=constant. We simply transcribe these exactly as they appear, noting the base-2 logarithm, the arguments, and the right‐hand‐side constants. There is no ambiguity or alternate interpretation—the variables are explicitly named and each equation is plainly stated. Since x, y, z>0, the arguments of the logarithms are well-defined, satisfying the domain requirement for log₂.

This clearly defines the variables of interest as x, y, and z, each restricted to the positive real numbers.\n\nStep 2: Identify where the system of equations begins. The phrase "that satisfy the following system of equations:" signals that the next three lines are the exact equations we must extract.\n\nStep 3: Extract each displayed equation exactly as written, noting the base of the logarithm is 2 and the algebraic structure inside each log:\n  1) log₂( x/(y\u2006z) ) = 1/2\n  2) log₂( y/(x\u2006z) ) = 1/3\n  3) log₂( z/(x\u2006y) ) = 1/4\n\nStep 4: Verify there are no other variables or hidden conditions.
