Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy both the linear constraint a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial constraint a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The first constraint is straightforward, representing a plane in 3D space. The second constraint is more complex and involves a polynomial equation. Given the symmetry of the equation, we first consider the case where a = b = c. This leads to a = b = c = 100, which satisfies both constraints: 3a = 300 and 6a^3 = 6,000,000. This is a valid solution. Next, we need to consider if there are other possible asymmetric solutions. The polynomial constraint can be rewritten in terms of the sum and products of a, b, and c, but due to its complexity and symmetry, it's unlikely that other distinct integer solutions exist other than permutations of (100, 100, 100). Therefore, the only valid solution, considering the symmetry and constraints, is (100, 100, 100), and permutations of this do not create distinct solutions since the variables are indistinguishable. Thus, there is only one valid triple.

proposed answer: To count the number of valid triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both constraints a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000, we need to ensure that we have correctly identified all possible solutions. The previous attempt assumed there were 2 distinct solutions with a <= b <= c, but this was not verified. We need to systematically check all possible values of a, b, and c, ensuring that the polynomial constraint is satisfied. For each valid solution, we must consider all permutations of (a, b, c) since the problem is symmetric. The number of permutations for distinct a, b, and c is 6 (3!), but if any two are equal, the number of permutations is reduced. We need to verify the number of distinct solutions and their permutations to ensure the count is accurate.
