From sub-task 3 we have (a−100)(b−100)(c−100)=0, so at least one of a,b,c equals 100.\n2. We break into three exhaustive cases:\n   Case 1: a=100. Then b+c=300−100=200 with b,c≥0. So all triples are (100,b,200−b) for b=0,1,…,200 (201 triples).\n   Case 2: b=100. Then a+c=200; all triples are (a,100,200−a) for a=0,1,…,200 (201 triples).\n   Case 3: c=100. Then a+b=200; all triples are (a,200−a,100) for a=0,1,…,200 (201 triples).\n3. The only overlap among these three lists is the triple (100,100,100), which appears in all three cases.\n4.

From Sub-task 1 we have the identity  \n   a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = S1·S2 − 3\u2009S3.  \n   The problem gives a²b + … + c²b = 6\u2009000\u2009000 and S1 = a + b + c = 300.  \n3. Substitute S1 = 300 and set the sum equal to 6\u2009000\u2009000:  \n   300·S2 − 3\u2009S3 = 6\u2009000\u2009000.  \n4. Divide by 3:  \n   100·S2 − S3 = 2\u2009000\u2009000.  \n5. Expand the product (a − 100)(b − 100)(c − 100):  \n   (a − 100)(b − 100)(c − 100)  \n   = abc − 100(ab + bc + ca) + 10\u2009000(a + b + c) − 1\u2009000\u2009000  \n   = S3 − 100\u2009S2 + 10\u2009000·S1 − 1\u2009000\u2009000.  \n6. Substitute S1 = 300 into that expansion:  \n   = S3 − 100\u2009S2 + 3\u2009000\u2009000 − 1\u2009000\u2009000  \n   = S3 − 100\u2009S2 + 2\u2009000\u2009000.  \n7. But from step 4 we have S3 = 100·S2 − 2\u2009000\u2009000.  \n   Therefore S3 − 100\u2009S2 + 2\u2009000\u2009000 = (100\u2009S2 − 2\u2009000\u2009000) − 100\u2009S2 + 2\u2009000\u2009000 = 0.  \n8.

Hence  \n   (a−100)(b−100)(c−100) = 0.\n\nThus we have factored and proved the desired result.; answer: (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent yVtY, round 0, factoring proof, thinking: We wish to show (a−100)(b−100)(c−100)=0 under the hypotheses a+b+c=300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b =6\u2009000\u2009000.\n\n1. Introduce elementary symmetric sums:\n   S1 = a+b+c =300,\n   S2 = ab+bc+ca,\n   S3 = abc.\n2. Recall the known identity:\n   a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = S1·S2 −3S3.\n   Substituting the given value 6\u2009000\u2009000 and S1=300,\n   300·S2 −3S3 =6\u2009000\u2009000  ⇒ 100·S2 −S3 =2\u2009000\u2009000  ⇒ S2 =20\u2009000 + S3/100.\n3. Observe the cubic factorization:\n   (a−100)(b−100)(c−100)\n   = abc −100(ab+bc+ca) +10000(a+b+c) −1\u2009000\u2009000\n   = S3 −100S2 +10000·S1 −1\u2009000\u2009000.\n4. Substitute S1=300 and S2=20\u2009000+S3/100:\n   S3 −100(20\u2009000 +S3/100) +10000·300 −1\u2009000\u2009000\n   = S3 −2\u2009000\u2009000 −S3 +3\u2009000\u2009000 −1\u2009000\u2009000\n   =0.\n5. Conclusion: (a−100)(b−100)(c−100)=0. Hence at least one of a,b,c equals 100.; answer: (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent dkr3, enumerating triples, thinking: 1. From sub-task 3 we have (a−100)(b−100)(c−100)=0, so at least one of a,b,c equals 100.\n2. We break into three exhaustive cases:\n   Case 1: a=100. Then b+c=300−100=200 with b,c≥0. So all triples are (100,b,200−b) for b=0,1,…,200 (201 triples).\n   Case 2: b=100. Then a+c=200; all triples are (a,100,200−a) for a=0,1,…,200 (201 triples).\n   Case 3: c=100. Then a+b=200; all triples are (a,200−a,100) for a=0,1,…,200 (201 triples).\n3. The only overlap among these three lists is the triple (100,100,100), which appears in all three cases.\n4. Therefore the union of these lists gives every ordered triple with one coordinate =100 and a+b+c=300, with no other overlaps.\n5. In descriptive form, the complete enumeration is given by the three parameterizations above.\n6. (Optional) Counting: 3×201−2 duplicate removals = 601 distinct triples.; answer: All ordered triples (a,b,c) satisfying a+b+c=300 and at least one coordinate equal to 100 are exactly:\n\nCase 1 (a=100): (100,b,200−b), b=0,1,2,…,200.\nCase 2 (b=100): (a,100,200−a), a=0,1,2,…,200.\nCase 3 (c=100): (a,200−a,100), a=0,1,2,…,200.\n\nThese three families cover every solution without omission or ambiguity. (The only common triple among all three is (100,100,100).)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 4u8x, feedback: The enumeration is correct.  By (a−100)(b−100)(c−100)=0 exactly one of a,b,c equals 100, so the three families cover all cases.  Each family has 201 triples (0≤other two≤200) and the only overlap among them is the single triple (100,100,100), which was counted three times and needs two removals, giving 3·201−2=601 distinct solutions.  No cases are missing or overcounted.; correct: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent jf5w, adjusting count, thinking: We partition all solutions with at least one coordinate equal to 100 into three cases:\n\n1. Case 1: a=100. Then b+c=200 with b,c≥0 gives 201 solutions.\n2. Case 2: b=100. Then a+c=200 with a,c≥0 gives 201 solutions.\n3. Case 3: c=100. Then a+b=200 with a,b≥0 gives 201 solutions.\n\nIf we simply add these, we get a raw count of 201+201+201=603. However, the triple (100,100,100) lies in all three cases, so it has been counted three times instead of once. To correct this overcount:\n\n• Total raw = 603\n• True count for (100,100,100) should be 1 but is currently 3 ⇒ we subtract the 2 extra counts.\n\nHence final total = 603 − 2 = 601.; answer: 601', iteration_idx=-1)]
