Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: Sub-task 4 gave that for each k=0,1,…,200 we get one multiset {100,k,200−k} with 6 ordered permutations when k≠100 and 1 when k=100.  There are 201 choices of k in total, exactly one of which (k=100) gives 1 solution and the other 200 each give 6 solutions.  Therefore the total number of ordered triples is 200×6 + 1 = 1201.

proposed answer: We partition all solutions with at least one coordinate equal to 100 into three cases:

1. Case 1: a=100. Then b+c=200 with b,c≥0 gives 201 solutions.
2. Case 2: b=100. Then a+c=200 with a,c≥0 gives 201 solutions.
3. Case 3: c=100. Then a+b=200 with a,b≥0 gives 201 solutions.

If we simply add these, we get a raw count of 201+201+201=603. However, the triple (100,100,100) lies in all three cases, so it has been counted three times instead of once. To correct this overcount:

• Total raw = 603
• True count for (100,100,100) should be 1 but is currently 3 ⇒ we subtract the 2 extra counts.

Hence final total = 603 − 2 = 601.
