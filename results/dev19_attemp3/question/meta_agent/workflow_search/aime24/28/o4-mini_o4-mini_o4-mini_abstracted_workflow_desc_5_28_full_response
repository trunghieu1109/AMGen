Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent DkFK:\nWe seek the radius r of the circle of tangency between the standard torus (major radius R=6, minor radius a=3) centered at the origin with axis along the z–axis, and a sphere of radius b=11 whose center lies at (0,0,D) on that same axis.  By symmetry the circle of tangency lies in a horizontal plane z=const, so every tangency point has ρ=√(x²+y²)=r and z-coördinate some z₀.  These must satisfy both surface equations:\n\n  Torus:  (ρ–R)² + z₀² = a²  ⇒  (r–6)² + z₀² = 9,    (1)\n  Sphere:  ρ² + (z₀–D)² = b² ⇒   r² + (z₀–D)² =121.     (2)\n\nFrom (1) we get\n    z₀² = 9 – (r–6)².                                      (3)\nFrom (2) we write\n    (z₀–D)² = 121 – r²    ⇒   z₀ = D ± √(121 – r²).    (4)\n\nSubstitute (4) into (3):\n    [D ± √(121–r²)]² = 9 – (r–6)².\nExpand and rearrange to isolate the square root, then square again.  A more direct route is to eliminate z₀ by subtracting (1) from (2):\n\n  (r² + (z₀–D)²) – ((r–6)² + z₀²) = 121–9 =112\n⇒ r² + z₀² –2Dz₀ + D² – r² +12r –36 – z₀² =112\n⇒ 12r –2D z₀ + D² –36 =112\n⇒ 2D z₀ = 12r + D² –148\n⇒ z₀ = (12r + D² –148)/(2D).

The result factors into two solutions corresponding to the “inner” and “outer” circles of tangency.  Equivalently one can solve for r explicitly to get the following closed‐form:\n\n   r(D) = [ R( b² + R² + D² – a² )  ±  D·√{ 4a²( R² + D² )  –  ( a² + R² + D² – b² )² } ]\n                                / [ 2( R² + D² ) ]\n\nwhere R=6, a=3, b=11.

To decide which root is D_i (inner‐equator contact) and which is D_o (outer‐equator contact), we compare the sphere’s top height z_top=−D+b to the torus’s inner‐equator plane at z=0.  For D=2√7≈5.29, z_top≈5.71>0 so the sphere rises above the equatorial plane and contacts the torus’s inner tube—hence D_i=2√7.  For D=4√10≈12.65, z_top≈−1.65<0 so the sphere remains below z=0 and touches the outer bulge—hence D_o=4√10.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent pVWI:\nD_i = 2√7, D_o = 4√10\n\n### Sub-task 3: Synthesize and choose the most consistent values for r_i and r_o. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent r8GE:\n1.

By symmetry the circle of tangency lies in a horizontal plane z=const, so every tangency point has ρ=√(x²+y²)=r and z-coördinate some z₀.  These must satisfy both surface equations:\n\n  Torus:  (ρ–R)² + z₀² = a²  ⇒  (r–6)² + z₀² = 9,    (1)\n  Sphere:  ρ² + (z₀–D)² = b² ⇒   r² + (z₀–D)² =121.     (2)\n\nFrom (1) we get\n    z₀² = 9 – (r–6)².                                      (3)\nFrom (2) we write\n    (z₀–D)² = 121 – r²    ⇒   z₀ = D ± √(121 – r²).    (4)\n\nSubstitute (4) into (3):\n    [D ± √(121–r²)]² = 9 – (r–6)².\nExpand and rearrange to isolate the square root, then square again.  A more direct route is to eliminate z₀ by subtracting (1) from (2):\n\n  (r² + (z₀–D)²) – ((r–6)² + z₀²) = 121–9 =112\n⇒ r² + z₀² –2Dz₀ + D² – r² +12r –36 – z₀² =112\n⇒ 12r –2D z₀ + D² –36 =112\n⇒ 2D z₀ = 12r + D² –148\n⇒ z₀ = (12r + D² –148)/(2D).                                 (5)\n\nNow substitute (5) into (1) or equivalently into z₀² = 9 – (r–6)² to obtain a single quadratic in r.  The result factors into two solutions corresponding to the “inner” and “outer” circles of tangency.  Equivalently one can solve for r explicitly to get the following closed‐form:\n\n   r(D) = [ R( b² + R² + D² – a² )  ±  D·√{ 4a²( R² + D² )  –  ( a² + R² + D² – b² )² } ]\n                                / [ 2( R² + D² ) ]\n\nwhere R=6, a=3, b=11.  Plugging in these values gives the final analytic expression\n\n   r(D) = [6(121 + 36 + D² –9)  ±  D·√{4·9·(36 + D²)  –  (9 +36 + D² –121)²}]\n                                    /[2(36 + D²)]\n\nThis single formula, with the choice of “+” or “–”, describes both the outer (larger‐radius) and inner (smaller‐radius) tangency circles as functions of the center‐separation D.; answer: r(D) = [6(121 + 36 + D^2 – 9) ± D · sqrt{ 4·9·(36 + D^2) – (9 + 36 + D^2 – 121)^2 }] / [2(36 + D^2)],\nwith the “+” or “–” giving the two possible (outer and inner) tangency‐circle radii.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 7M3V, thinking: We fix the torus center at the origin and place the sphere center on the z–axis at (0,0,D).  The torus has major radius R=6 and tube (minor) radius a=3.  There are two ways the sphere of radius b=11 can be externally tangent to the torus: at the torus’s outer equator (distance from torus center =R+a) or at its inner equator (distance =R−a).  In each case the single point of tangency must satisfy that its distance to the sphere center equals b.\n\n1.
