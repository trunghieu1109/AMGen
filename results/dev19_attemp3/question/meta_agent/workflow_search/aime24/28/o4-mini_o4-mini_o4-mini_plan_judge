Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We have r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/7.
Compute the difference:
  r_i – r_o = 33/4 – 33/7
           = 33*(7) / (4*7) – 33*(4) / (4*7)
           = (231 – 132) / 28
           = 99 / 28.
This fraction is in lowest terms since gcd(99,28)=1.
Hence m=99, n=28, so m+n = 99 + 28 = 127.

proposed answer: We start with the values from Sub-task 1.2: r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 51/7.  Step 1: Express both with a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 7 is 28.  
• r_i = 33/4 = (33×7)/28 = 231/28.  
• r_o = 51/7 = (51×4)/28 = 204/28.

Step 2: Subtract to find the difference:
 r_i – r_o = (231/28) – (204/28) = 27/28.

Step 3: Reduce the fraction 27/28.  The greatest common divisor of 27 and 28 is 1, so 27/28 is already in lowest terms.  Hence m = 27 and n = 28.

Step 4: Compute m + n = 27 + 28 = 55.

Checks and potential pitfalls:
– We verify that r_i > r_o numerically: 33/4 = 8.25 and 51/7 ≈ 7.2857, so the difference is positive as assumed.
– We confirm no mislabeling of inner vs. outer radii has occurred.
– All arithmetic steps have been cross-checked to avoid sign or arithmetic errors.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 4 we have torus major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3, sphere radius S = 11. For external tangency: center distance for the inner‐tube contact is D_inner = |S − r| = 11 − 3 = 8, and for the outer‐tube contact is D_outer = S + r = 14. The contact‐circle formula is r_contact(D) = R ± (r·R)/D. Using the '+' branch at D_inner gives r_i = 6 + (3·6)/8 = 33/4; using the '−' branch at D_outer gives r_o = 6 − (3·6)/14 = 33/7. Since 33/4 > 33/7, we confirm r_i > r_o. The difference Δr = r_i − r_o = 33/4 − 33/7 = (231 − 132)/28 = 99/28, already in lowest terms as gcd(99,28)=1. Hence m = 99, n = 28, and m + n = 127. There are no other sign or distance cases because S > r dictates these unique external tangency conditions.
