Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent fW47', content="From Sub-task 4 we have torus major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3, sphere radius S = 11. For external tangency: center distance for the inner‐tube contact is D_inner = |S − r| = 11 − 3 = 8, and for the outer‐tube contact is D_outer = S + r = 14. The contact‐circle formula is r_contact(D) = R ± (r·R)/D. Using the '+' branch at D_inner gives r_i = 6 + (3·6)/8 = 33/4; using the '−' branch at D_outer gives r_o = 6 − (3·6)/14 = 33/7. Since 33/4 > 33/7, we confirm r_i > r_o. The difference Δr = r_i − r_o = 33/4 − 33/7 = (231 − 132)/28 = 99/28, already in lowest terms as gcd(99,28)=1. Hence m = 99, n = 28, and m + n = 127.

Equivalently, one can derive this by locating the unique latitude φ on the torus at which its surface normal lines up with the radial direction to the sphere center, and then reading off the horizontal radius of that latitude circle on the torus:\n\n1.  Coordinates and equations:\n   •  Place the torus so its axis of revolution is the z–axis and its center‐circle of radius R lies in the plane z=0.  A point on the torus may be parametrized by (θ,φ):\n       x=(R + r\u2009cosφ)\u2009cosθ,\n       y=(R + r\u2009cosφ)\u2009sinθ,\n       z= r\u2009sinφ.\n   •  The sphere of radius S (unused in the general derivation) has center on the z–axis at z=D; its normal at any point P is the vector from the sphere’s center to P, namely (x, y, z–D).\n   •  The torus surface normal is ∇F for F=(√(x²+y²)–R)²+z²–r², which at a torus point simplifies to a vector proportional to (r\u2009cosφ\u2009x/(R+r\u2009cosφ), r\u2009cosφ\u2009y/(R+r\u2009cosφ), r\u2009sinφ).\n\n2.  Tangency condition (normals parallel) at latitude φ:\n   We require\n         (r\u2009cosφ)/(R + r\u2009cosφ)  =  (r\u2009sinφ)/(r\u2009sinφ − D)\n   ⇒  R\u2009sinφ + D\u2009cosφ = 0\n   ⇒  tanφ = −D/R.\n\n3.  The horizontal (in‐plane) radius of the torus at latitude φ is\n       r_contact = R + r\u2009cosφ.\n   Since tanφ=−D/R, we have  cosφ = ± R/√(R² + D²).\n\n4.  Therefore two solutions arise:\n     •  cosφ = +R/√(R² + D²)  ⇒  r_contact = R + r·(R/√(R² + D²))\n     •  cosφ = −R/√(R² + D²)  ⇒  r_contact = R − r·(R/√(R² + D²)).\n\n5.  In terms of D measured from the torus axis, these give the two possible contact‐circle radii.  If instead D is the center–to–center distance between the sphere and the torus’s generating‐circle center (as in Sub‐task 2), then one shows √(R² + D_axis²)=D_gen, so cosφ=R/D_gen and the same two radii become\n       r_contact = R ± (r·R)/D\n   where the “+”–choice is the larger circle on the outer side of the torus tube and the “−”–choice is the smaller circle on the inner side.; answer: r_contact = R ± (r·R)/D, with the plus sign yielding the outer‐tube contact circle and the minus sign the inner‐tube contact circle.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent uEp0, round 0, thinking: We place the torus so that its axis is the z–axis, its generating circle (tube‐circle) center C_t lies in the plane z=0 at distance R from the z–axis, and the sphere center C_s lies somewhere on the z–axis at height h.  Then the center‐to‐center distance is D=|C_s−C_t|=√(R²+h²).  A point P of contact must lie on the generating circle and on the sphere, and the common normal there points along the line C_tP and along the line C_sP, so C_t,P,C_s are collinear.  Thus P=C_t + s·u, where u is the unit vector from C_t to C_s and s=±r (the two “sides” of the tube).  At tangency the distance |P−C_s| equals the sphere radius S, so |s−D|=S, which forces D=S±r – the two cases of outer‐tube or inner‐tube contact.  The horizontal (radial) coordinate of P from the z–axis is \n   r_contact = |(C_t)_⊥ + s·u_⊥| = |R − s·(R/D)| = R·|D−s|/D.\nSubstituting s=+r (outer‐tube surface) or s=−r (inner‐tube surface) and using D=S±r at tangency gives the neat formulas below.; answer: r_contact = (R·(D − r))/D for outer‐tube contact (sphere touches outside of the tube), and r_contact = (R·(D + r))/D for inner‐tube contact (sphere nests against the inside of the tube).  Equivalently, at tangency D=S+r yields r_contact_outer = R·S/(S+r), and D=S−r yields r_contact_inner = R·S/(S−r).\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent WH5E, round 0, thinking: We seek the radius ρ of the common circle along which a sphere of center O_s and radius S is tangent to a torus of major radius R (center O_t of generating circle) and minor radius r.  By symmetry we place O_t at the origin, the torus axis along the z–axis, and O_s at (0,0,D).  Any point P on the contact circle lies at cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z) with θ arbitrary, so the circle lies in a plane z=constant and has radius ρ.  \n\n1.  Torus equation (in ρ,z):  (ρ−R)² + z² = r².             (1)\n2.  Sphere equation:         ρ² + (z−D)² = S².                (2)\n3.  At a tangency point P the normals ∇F (to torus) and ∇G (to sphere) are parallel.  Equivalently, the line P\u2009O_t (direction of torus normal) and the line P\u2009O_s (direction of sphere normal) coincide.  In coordinates this yields\n     λ= (ρ−R)/ρ  and   z = λ(z−D),\n   whence  z·R = −D·(ρ−R).                                     (3)\n\n4.  Substitute (3) into (1):\n     (ρ−R)² + [ (ρ−R)·D/R ]² = r²\n     ⇒ (ρ−R)² (1 + D²/R²) = r²\n     ⇒ ρ − R = ± (rR)/√(R² + D²).\n\nThus the contact circle radius is\n     ρ = R ± (rR)/√(R² + D²).\n\n5.  The “+” choice gives the larger ring (outer‐tube contact), the “−” choice the smaller ring (inner‐tube contact).; answer: r_contact(D) = R ± (r·R)/√(R² + D²), where the +–sign yields the outer‐tube contact circle and the ––sign yields the inner‐tube contact circle.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent T9N3, round 0, thinking: We seek the circle along which a sphere of center O_s at distance D from the torus center O_t is tangent to the torus of major radius R and minor radius r.  By symmetry the contact locus is a circle of constant toroidal‐angle v, i.e. the set of points P(u,v) = ((R + r cos v)\u2009cos u,\n (R + r cos v)\u2009sin u, r sin v), 0≤u<2π.\n\n1.  Unit normal at P to the torus is n = (cos u cos v,\u2009sin u cos v,\u2009sin v).  For tangency we require O_s–P ∥ n.  If we place O_s on the z‐axis at (0,0,D), then\n   O_s–P = (−(R+r cos v)\u2009cos u, −(R+r cos v)\u2009sin u, D−r sin v)\n  must equal a scalar λ times n.  Equating the x‐ and y‐components gives\n   λ cos v = −(R + r cos v),\n  so λ = −(R + r cos v)/cos v.\n  The z‐component then yields\n   D − r sin v = λ sin v = −(R + r cos v)\u2009tan v,\n  which simplifies to\n   D\u2009cos v + R\u2009sin v = 0\n  ⇒ tan v = −D/R.\n\n2.  Hence there are two solutions for v differing by π; one has cos v = +R/√(R² + D²), the other cos v = −R/√(R² + D²).  The circle of contact lies at radius\n   ρ_contact = √(x²+y²) = R + r\u2009cos v\n  around the z‐axis.  Thus in general\n   r_contact(D) = R ± (r\u2009R)/√(R² + D²).\n\n3.  Which sign is which?  • For “outer‐tube” contact (sphere pressing on the outside of the torus tube), v lies in the fourth quadrant so cos v>0 and one takes the + sign:\n       r_o = R + (r\u2009R)/√(R² + D²).\n     • For “inner‐tube” contact (sphere pressing into the inner hole of the torus), v lies in the second quadrant so cos v<0 and one takes the – sign:\n       r_i = R − (r\u2009R)/√(R² + D²).\n\nThese two formulas, together with D_outer=S+r and D_inner=|S−r|, give the two contact‐circle radii.; answer: r_contact(D) = R ± \\frac{r\\,R}{\\sqrt{R^2 + D^2}},\n\nwith + for the outer–tube contact circle and – for the inner–tube contact circle.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision Agent SOom, thinking: We place the torus so its generating‐circle center O_t lies at distance R from the z‐axis in the plane z=0, and its axis is the z‐axis. The sphere center O_s lies on the z‐axis at some height so that the center‐to‐center distance is D=|O_s–O_t|. A point P on the torus has coordinates\n  x=(R+r cosφ) cosθ,\n  y=(R+r cosφ) sinθ,\n  z=r sinφ.\nBy symmetry the contact locus is a circle at fixed φ, radius ρ=√(x²+y²)=R+r cosφ. At tangency, the torus normal at P (which points along the line O_tP) aligns with the sphere normal (along O_sP), so O_t, P, O_s are collinear. This forces\no_tP ∥ O_sP ⇒ P–O_t = λ(P–O_s) for some λ.\nProjecting to the z‐axis and radial plane shows\n  tanφ = –(z‐axis separation)/(radial separation) = –D/R,\nso cosφ = ±R/D.

For external tangency: center distance for the inner‐tube contact is D_inner = |S − r| = 11 − 3 = 8, and for the outer‐tube contact is D_outer = S + r = 14. The contact‐circle formula is r_contact(D) = R ± (r·R)/D. Using the \'+\' branch at D_inner gives r_i = 6 + (3·6)/8 = 33/4; using the \'−\' branch at D_outer gives r_o = 6 − (3·6)/14 = 33/7. Since 33/4 > 33/7, we confirm r_i > r_o. The difference Δr = r_i − r_o = 33/4 − 33/7 = (231 − 132)/28 = 99/28, already in lowest terms as gcd(99,28)=1. Hence m = 99, n = 28, and m + n = 127.
