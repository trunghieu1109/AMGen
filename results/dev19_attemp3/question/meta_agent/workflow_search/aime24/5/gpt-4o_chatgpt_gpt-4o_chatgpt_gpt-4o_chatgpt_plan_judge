Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, where the inradius is the distance from a point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. The inradius is given by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the surface area of the tetrahedron. The edge lengths are AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). The volume V can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant, and the surface area S is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces, which can be found using Heron's formula. After calculating V and S, the inradius is found to be 6 * sqrt(2) / 5. In this expression, m = 6, n = 2, and p = 5. These values satisfy the conditions that m and p are relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the sum m + n + p is 6 + 2 + 5 = 13.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we determined that the inradius expression is given by \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 3 \), \( n = 41 \), and \( p = 1 \). These values were chosen because they fit the form \( m \sqrt{n} / p \) and satisfy the conditions that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. The sum \( m + n + p \) is calculated by adding these values together: \( m = 3 \), \( n = 41 \), and \( p = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 3 + 41 + 1 = 45 \).
