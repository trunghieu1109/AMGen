Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We start with the expression r = (10√42)/63. We need it in the form m√n/p with gcd(m,p)=1 and n squarefree.

1. Examine the rational coefficient 10/63. Compute gcd(10,63):
   • 10 = 2·5
   • 63 = 3²·7
   They share no prime factors, so gcd(10,63)=1. The fraction 10/63 is already in lowest terms.

2. Examine the radicand 42. Factorization: 42 = 2·3·7. All prime factors are distinct, so 42 is squarefree.

Thus the expression is already in lowest-term form with m=10, n=42, p=63. There are no alternate cases because any common factor in 10 and 63 would have reduced the fraction, and any squared factor in 42 would allow pulling out of the radical, neither of which apply here.

Finally, compute m+n+p = 10 + 42 + 63 = 115.

proposed answer: We are given the inradius expression r = \(10√42/63\). We must write it in the form \(m√n/p\) with gcd(m,p)=1 and n squarefree, then extract m, n, p and compute m+n+p.  

Step 1: Identify m, n, p  
The expression is \(10√42/63\), so m=10, n=42, p=63.  

Step 2: Check that gcd(m,p)=1  
Compute gcd(10,63). The prime factors: 10=2·5, 63=3·3·7. No common prime factors, so gcd(10,63)=1.  

Step 3: Check that n is squarefree  
42=2·3·7, all primes distinct, so 42 is squarefree.  

Since all conditions are satisfied, the values m=10, n=42, p=63 are correct.  

Step 4: Compute m+n+p  
10 + 42 + 63 = 115.
