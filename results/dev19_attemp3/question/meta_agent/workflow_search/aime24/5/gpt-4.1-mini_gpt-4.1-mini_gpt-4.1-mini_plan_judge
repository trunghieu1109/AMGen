Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The inradius r of the tetrahedron is given by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. From the previous subtasks, the volume V was found to be (14 * sqrt(21)) / 3 and the surface area S was found to be 8 * sqrt(21). Substituting these values into the formula, we get r = 3 * ((14 * sqrt(21)) / 3) / (8 * sqrt(21)). The factor 3 in numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying to r = (14 * sqrt(21)) / (8 * sqrt(21)). The sqrt(21) terms cancel out, leaving r = 14 / 8 = 7 / 4. This fraction is already in simplest form since 7 and 4 are coprime. To express r in the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, we note that sqrt(1) = 1, so r = (7 * sqrt(1)) / 4. Here, m = 7, n = 1, and p = 4. The number n = 1 is square-free by definition, and m and p are coprime, satisfying all the problem's conditions. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 7 + 1 + 4 = 12. This conclusion is consistent, fully simplified, and meets all the requirements of the problem.

proposed answer: The simplified inradius expression obtained in Subtask 6 is r = (27√2) / 14. Here, m = 27, n = 2, and p = 14. We verify the conditions: m and p must be relatively prime, and n must be square-free. The prime factorization of m = 27 is 3^3, and for p = 14 is 2 * 7. Since they share no common prime factors, m and p are relatively prime. The radicand n = 2 is a prime number and thus square-free. The expression is in simplest radical form. Numerically, r ≈ (27 * 1.4142) / 14 ≈ 2.7273, consistent with previous calculations of volume and surface area. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 27 + 2 + 14 = 43 is correct and consistent with all checks.
