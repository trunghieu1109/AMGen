Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The point C lies on the segment AB, where A = (1/2, 0) and B = (0, sqrt(3)/2). Parameterizing AB by t in [0,1], we have C(t) = ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t). The problem states that C is the unique point on AB (excluding endpoints) that does not lie on any segment PQ from the family F other than AB itself. Each segment PQ in F has length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, so P = (x,0), Q = (0,y), with x,y > 0 and x^2 + y^2 = 1. For C to lie on some segment PQ, there must exist x,y > 0 with x^2 + y^2 = 1 such that C lies on the line segment PQ. The condition for C to lie on PQ is that the sum of the ratios of the coordinates of C to those of P and Q equals 1: (C_x)/x + (C_y)/y = 1. Define f(x) = ((1/2)(1 - t))/x + ((sqrt(3)/2) t)/sqrt(1 - x^2) for x in (0,1). Since f(x) tends to infinity as x approaches 0+ or 1-, it attains a minimum at some x in (0,1). If the minimum of f(x) ≤ 1, then C lies on some segment PQ in F other than AB; if minimum > 1, no such segment exists. The unique point C corresponds to the unique t in (0,1) where the minimum of f(x) equals exactly 1, and this coverage occurs only for PQ = AB. By analysis and previous reasoning, this unique t is 1/2, giving C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Calculating OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4. The fraction 1/4 is already in lowest terms with p=1 and q=4, so p+q=5. This matches the problem's conditions and the uniqueness requirement. Therefore, the squared distance OC^2 is 1/4, and the sum p+q is 5.

proposed answer: We start with the parameterization of segment AB as C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, (sqrt(3)/2) * t) for t in [0,1]. The family F consists of unit segments PQ with P = (x,0) and Q = (0, sqrt(1 - x^2)) for x in [0,1]. The coverage condition for a point C on AB to lie on some segment PQ in F other than AB is given by the equation f(x) = C_x / x + C_y / sqrt(1 - x^2) = 1, with s = C_x / x in [0,1] and 1 - s = C_y / sqrt(1 - x^2) in [0,1], and x ≠ 1/2. The unique point C on AB that is not covered by any segment in F other than AB itself corresponds to the value of t for which no such x ≠ 1/2 satisfies f(x) = 1. By analyzing the function f(x) and the constraints, the unique such point C is found at t = 2/3. Substituting t = 2/3 into the parameterization of AB gives C = (1/2 - (2/3)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)*(2/3)) = (1/2 - 1/3, (sqrt(3)/2)*(2/3)) = (1/6, sqrt(3)/3). Then, the squared distance OC^2 = (1/6)^2 + (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/36 + 3/9 = 1/36 + 1/3 = (1 + 12)/36 = 13/36. The fraction 13/36 is in lowest terms since 13 is prime and does not divide 36. Therefore, p = 13 and q = 36, and p + q = 49. This result is rational and consistent with the problem statement, confirming the unique point C on AB that is only covered by AB itself and no other segment in F.
