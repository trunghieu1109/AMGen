Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We have C = (1/8, 3√3/8). To find OC^2, compute the square of its distance from O = (0,0):
1. OC^2 = (x_C)^2 + (y_C)^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2.
2. Compute each term: (1/8)^2 = 1/64; (3√3/8)^2 = 9·3/64 = 27/64.
3. Sum: OC^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16 after reducing by factor 4.
4. Hence p/q = 7/16 in lowest terms, so p = 7 and q = 16.
5. Therefore p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.
