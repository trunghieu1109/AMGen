Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve Sub-task 2, we need to find the sum p + q, where OC^2 = p/q and p and q are relatively prime integers. From the related sub-task 1, we have already determined that the coordinates of point C are (1/4, \sqrt{3}/4). The distance OC is calculated using the distance formula: OC = \sqrt{(1/4)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/4)^2}. This simplifies to OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Therefore, OC^2 = 1/4, which means p = 1 and q = 4. Since 1 and 4 are relatively prime, the sum p + q is 1 + 4 = 5.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we calculated the square of the distance OC^2 as 1/4. This was done by finding the coordinates of point C on the line segment AB, which was determined to be (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Using the distance formula from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/4, sqrt(3)/4), we found OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This expression is already in the form p/q, where p = 1 and q = 4. Since 1 and 4 are relatively prime, the sum p + q is 1 + 4.
