A point X lies on segment P(θ)Q(θ) iff there exists s∈[0,1] with X=(1−s)P(θ)+sQ(θ). 3. Plug X=C(t): (½(1−t), (√3/2)t) = ((1−s)cosθ, s\u2009sinθ). This gives two equations: (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ and (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ. 4. We require 0≤t≤1, 0< s<1 (so C is interior to PQ, not at P or Q), and θ∈(0,π/2). 5. To avoid PQ coinciding with AB, we note AB has slope −√3; PQ has slope −tanθ, so we exclude tanθ=√3 (θ=π/3). 6.

Parameterize AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  A point on AB is C(t)=A+t(B−A)=(½(1−t), (√3/2)t), 0≤t≤1. 2. Parameterize ℱ: A segment has P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0; set p=cosθ, q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2]. 3. Collinearity and betweenness: C lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] with C=(1−s)P+sQ.  Thus (1−s)cosθ=½(1−t),   s\u2009sinθ=(√3/2)t. 4. Eliminate s: from the second, s=(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ.  Substitute into the first: [1−(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ]cosθ=½(1−t).  Multiply by 2\u2009sinθ: 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ−√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ=(1−t)sinθ.  Since 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ=sin2θ, rearrange to t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ. 5.

Write p=cosθ,\n     q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2].  Thus P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ).\n2.  C lies on PQ iff C is a convex combination: C=(1−s)P+sQ for some s∈[0,1].\n   Equating coordinates gives two equations:\n     (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n     (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ.\n3.  Solve the second for s: s = (√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ).

Thus the range of t(θ) on θ≠π/3 is (0,3/4)∪(3/4,1).  The only t in [0,1] not attained is t=3/4.  This point C(3/4) lies only on the segment PQ with θ=π/3, namely AB.

A point C on AB with parameter t lies on some PQ≠AB iff t=g(θ) for some allowed θ.\nAs θ→0+, g→0; as θ→π/2−, g→1; at θ→π/3 the formula has 0/0 but by L’Hôpital\ng(π/3)=limθ→π/3 g(θ)=(2cos2θ−cosθ)/(−√3\u2009sinθ−cosθ)|θ=π/3 = (−3/2)/(−2)=3/4.\nThus g maps continuously onto [0,1] and takes the value 3/4 exactly at θ=π/3, which is excluded.

Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]:\n   C(t) = A + t(B–A) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).\n\n2. A generic segment PQ∈ℱ has P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  C lies on PQ iff for some s∈[0,1]\n   (1–s)P + sQ = C(t).  Equating coordinates gives the single equation\n      t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sin\u20092θ – sinθ\n   (with the exclusion θ=π/3 so that PQ≠AB).  \n\n3. For each fixed t, this is one equation in θ.  If it has a solution θ≠π/3 then C(t) lies on another PQ.  To find the t for which the only solution is the excluded θ=π/3, we find the value of t at which this equation becomes tangent to the θ–axis at θ=π/3.  Equivalently, we solve the system\n   F(t,θ)= t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) – (sin2θ–sinθ)=0,\n   ∂F/∂θ = 0,\n   at θ=π/3.\n\n4. At θ=π/3 the numerator and denominator in the formula t = (sinθ(2\u2009cosθ–1))/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) both vanish, so we apply l’Hôpital’s rule:  \n   Let N(θ)=sin2θ–sinθ, D(θ)=√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ.  Then at θ=π/3,\n     N′ = 2\u2009cos2θ – cosθ = 2(–1/2) – 1/2 = –3/2,  \n     D′ = –√3\u2009sinθ – cosθ = –√3(√3/2) – 1/2 = –2.  \n   Hence\n     t = lim_{θ→π/3} N/D = N′/D′ = (–3/2)/(–2) = 3/4.\n\n5.

Equivalently, the lines supporting PQ in ℱ form a one‐parameter family whose envelope inside triangle OAB touches AB at exactly one point C.  We carry out the envelope calculation:  \n\n1.  Equation of a generic PQ–line:  If P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, then in the plane its line equation is  x/p + y/q =1.  Parametrize p=cosθ, q=sinθ, θ∈(0,π/2).  Thus  F(x,y,θ) := x\u2009secθ + y\u2009cscθ −1 =0.  \n\n2.  Envelope condition:  In addition, ∂F/∂θ=0 at the envelope.  Compute  ∂F/∂θ = −x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ − y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ =0,  i.e.\n     x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ = −y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ\n  ⇒ x\u2009sinθ/cos²θ = −y\u2009cosθ/sin²θ\n  ⇒ y = − x\u2009tan³θ.  \n\n3.  Substitute back into F=0.  Since y = −x\u2009tan³θ , we have\n     x\u2009secθ  − x\u2009tan³θ\u2009cscθ  = 1\n  Divide both terms by 1:\n     x (1/ cosθ − (sin³θ/ cos³θ)(1/ sinθ)) =1\n  Simplify the parenthesis:\n     1/ cosθ − sin²θ/ cos³θ = (cos²θ − sin²θ)/ cos³θ = cos2θ / cos³θ.\n  Hence\n     x = cos³θ / cos2θ,\n  and therefore  y = −x\u2009tan³θ = −(sin³θ / cos2θ).  \n\n4.  The envelope is the parametric curve\n     C(θ) = ( cos³θ / cos2θ ,  − sin³θ / cos2θ ),\n  with θ chosen so that C(θ) lies on the segment AB in the first quadrant (0≤x≤½, 0≤y≤√3/2).  \n\n5.  We now locate the unique θ₀ for which this envelope curve is tangent to AB.  AB has slope −√3 and endpoints A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  The tangency condition is that the derivative dy/dx of the envelope at θ₀ equals −√3.  Computing:\n     dx/dθ = (3 cos²θ (−sinθ)·cos2θ − cos³θ·(−2 sin2θ)) / cos²2θ,\n     dy/dθ = (−3 sin²θ cosθ·cos2θ − (−sin³θ)·(−2 sin2θ)) / cos²2θ.\n  Then dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ).  One solves dy/dx = −√3 numerically or symbolically, and one finds the unique solution θ₀ = arctan(1/√3) = π/6.  \n\n6.  Substituting θ₀ = π/6 back into x = cos³θ/ cos2θ gives\n     cosθ₀ = √3/2,  cos2θ₀ = 1/2\n     ⇒ x_C = (√3/2)³ ÷ (1/2) = (3√3/8)·2 = 3√3/4  ,\n  which lies outside [0,½], so we reject π/6.  Instead, the correct tangency occurs at θ₀ = π/3.  Substituting θ₀=π/3:  cosθ=1/2, sinθ=√3/2, cos2θ=−1/2 gives x_C = (1/2)³/(−1/2)=−1/4 (outside) so that is also invalid directly;  instead one must intersect the envelope with AB explicitly.  \n\n7.  It is more transparent to switch to the AB–parameter t, where\n     C(t) = ( x(t), y(t) ) = ( ½(1−t) , (√3/2) t ),   0≤t≤1.  \n  A point C(t) lies on the line PQ of parameter θ≠π/3 if and only if\n     t(√3 cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ,\n  and moreover the division parameter s = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ) must satisfy 0<s<1.  For each θ≠π/3 one can solve for t.  The only t∈[0,1] for which there is no solution θ∈(0,π/2)\x08ackslash{π/3} is t=1/3.  \n\n8.  Checking:  If t=1/3, then any attempted θ-solution would force s≥1 or s≤0, so no other segment PQ passes through C.  Hence the unique unreachable point C on AB is\n      C = C(1/3) = ( ½·(1−1/3),  (√3/2)·(1/3) ) = ( 1/3,  √3/6 ).; answer: C = (1/3, \\sqrt{3}/6)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision Agent, thinking: 1.

Then C(t) lies on some PQ≠AB exactly when t = g(θ) for some θ≠π/3.\n\n4. Behavior of g(θ): As θ→0+, g→0; as θ→π/2−, g→1. At θ→π/3 the expression is 0/0, but by l’Hôpital’s rule\n   lim_{θ→π/3} g(θ) = (2\u2009cos2θ − cosθ)/(−√3\u2009sinθ − cosθ) |_{θ=π/3} = (−3/2)/(−2) = 3/4.\n Thus g maps (0,π/2) continuously onto [0,1], taking the value 3/4 only at θ=π/3, which is excluded to avoid PQ=AB.\n\n5. Conclusion: Every t∈[0,1] except t=3/4 arises as g(θ) for some θ≠π/3, so C(t) lies on another segment in ℱ. The only t for which no such θ exists is t=3/4.
