Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we have established that the total number of valid row and column color assignments is 1024. Each assignment corresponds to choosing a subset of rows to be white (the rest black) and a subset of columns to be white (the rest black). The chips are placed exactly at the intersections where the row and column colors match, forming two complete bipartite subgraphs: one induced by the white rows and white columns, and the other by the black rows and black columns. The maximality condition ensures that no additional chips can be added without violating the uniform color constraints. Since the chips are indistinguishable within their color groups and the problem only requires counting distinct maximal placements, each unique pair of subsets (white rows, white columns) corresponds to a unique maximal chip placement. There is no overcounting because different subsets produce different chip patterns. The total number of such pairs is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. Therefore, the total number of maximal chip placements on the grid, accounting for indistinguishability and constraints, is 1024. This reasoning is consistent with the bipartite graph model, the maximality condition, and the problem constraints, and it avoids undercounting or overcounting by considering all possible subsets explicitly.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, we have established that the total number of configurations formed by choosing subsets of rows and columns colored white (with the rest black) is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. Each configuration corresponds to placing white chips at intersections of white rows and white columns, black chips at intersections of black rows and black columns, and leaving empty cells where row and column colors differ. The empty configuration (where no chips are placed) corresponds to the case where both the white row subset and white column subset are empty. This configuration is invalid because it violates the maximality condition requiring at least one chip placed. Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is 1024 - 1 = 1023. Each unique pair of subsets (rows and columns) corresponds to a unique maximal placement because the chip placement pattern is uniquely determined by these subsets. The chips are indistinguishable within their colors, but the positions are fixed by the subsets chosen, so no overcounting occurs. The maximality condition is satisfied because any empty cell lies at the intersection of a row and a column with different colors, so placing a chip there would violate monochromaticity. Hence, no additional chip can be added without breaking the constraints. This reasoning confirms the count of 1023 maximal chip placements is correct, complete, and consistent with all problem constraints and previous sub-task analyses. There is no undercounting or overcounting, and the indistinguishability of chips does not affect the count since placements are defined by subsets of rows and columns, not individual chips.
