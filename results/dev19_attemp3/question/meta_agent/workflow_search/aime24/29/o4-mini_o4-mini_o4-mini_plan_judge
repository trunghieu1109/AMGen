Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We model every maximal configuration by a choice of colours for the 5 rows (r₁,…,r₅) and for the 5 columns (c₁,…,c₅), each colour being white (W) or black (B), together with the rule: place a chip in cell (i,j) exactly when r_i=c_j.  To ensure maximality—no further chip can be placed without breaking row/column uniformity—we require every row and every column to already contain at least one chip.  Equivalently:

1. For each row i, there must exist at least one column j with c_j=r_i, so r_i appears among the column colours; otherwise row i would be empty and could accept a chip of its own colour.
2. For each column j, there must exist at least one row i with r_i=c_j, so c_j appears among the row colours; otherwise column j would be empty and could accept a chip of its own colour.

Thus both the 5-tuple (r₁,…,r₅) and the 5-tuple (c₁,…,c₅) must each contain at least one W and at least one B.  

Counting such 5-tuples:
- Total assignments of W/B to 5 positions = 2^5 = 32.
- Exclude the all-white assignment and the all-black assignment (each fails to contain both colours).
- Valid row assignments = 32 – 2 = 30.
- Valid column assignments likewise = 30.

By the rule of product, each valid row-colour choice can be paired with each valid column-colour choice, giving 30 × 30 = 900 distinct maximal configurations.

proposed answer: To compute the total number of maximal configurations, we consider three disjoint cases:

1. All‐white configuration:
   • We fill every cell of the 5×5 grid with a white chip.
   • This clearly satisfies the condition that each row and column is monochromatic (all white), and no additional chip can be added.
   • There is exactly 1 way to do this.

2. All‐black configuration:
   • Similarly, fill every cell with a black chip.
   • Each row and column is monochromatic (all black), and the grid is full.
   • There is exactly 1 way to do this.

3. Mixed‐colour maximal configurations:
   • By Sub‐task 8, the number of maximal configurations that use both white and black chips, with each row and column monochromatic and no further chip can be added, is 900.

Since these three categories are mutually exclusive and collectively cover all maximal placements, we sum their counts:

Total = (all‐white) + (all‐black) + (mixed) = 1 + 1 + 900 = 902.
