Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: We start with the two time‐equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting gives 9/s − 9/(s+2) = 1.6.  Simplifying yields s^2+2s−11.25=0, whose roots are s=2.5 and s=−4.5. We discard s=−4.5 because a walking speed cannot be negative. Thus s=2.5>0 is valid. Substituting back into 9/s + t/60 = 4 gives t/60 = 0.4 ⇒ t=24, and t≥0 is satisfied. Next, for speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h the walking time is 9/3.0=3 hours = 180 minutes; adding t=24 minutes gives a total time of 204 minutes, which is >0. We also verify denominators s and s+2 are nonzero, and all quantities are physically meaningful. No other real positive solution exists, so all positivity constraints (s>0, t>=0, total time>0) are met.

Answer:s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes, total time=204 minutes (all positivity conditions satisfied)
Extracted answer: s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes, total time=204 minutes (all positivity conditions satisfied)
Correct answer: 204
