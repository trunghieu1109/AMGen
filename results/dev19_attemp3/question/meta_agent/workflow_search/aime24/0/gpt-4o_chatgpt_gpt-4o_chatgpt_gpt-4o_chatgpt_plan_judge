Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: To solve this task, we need to ensure that we correctly convert the time Aya takes to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of s + 0.5 km/h into minutes, including the time spent at the coffee shop. From the previous sub-task, we have determined that Aya's walking speed s is 2.5 km/h and the time spent in the coffee shop t is 24 minutes. When Aya walks at s + 0.5 km/h, her speed becomes 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. The distance she walks is 9 kilometers. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at 3 km/h is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed: time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. This is the time spent walking. We also need to include the time spent in the coffee shop, which is t = 24 minutes. To find the total time in minutes, we convert the walking time from hours to minutes and add the coffee shop time. Walking time in minutes = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes. Total time = 180 minutes + 24 minutes = 204 minutes. This calculation is consistent with the problem statement and the values of s and t obtained. Therefore, the total time in minutes, including the time spent at the coffee shop, is 204 minutes.
