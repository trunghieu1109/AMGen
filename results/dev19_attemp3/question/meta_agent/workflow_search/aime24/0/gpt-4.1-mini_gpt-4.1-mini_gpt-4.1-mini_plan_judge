Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_0
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined the walking speed s = 2.5 km/h and the coffee shop time t = 24 minutes. We are asked to find the total time in minutes when Aya walks at speed s + 0.5 km/h, which is 3.0 km/h. The walking distance is 9 km. The walking time is calculated as distance divided by speed, so walking time = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours. Converting this to minutes, 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes. Adding the coffee shop time t = 24 minutes, the total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Multiple independent agents have confirmed this calculation, and it is consistent with the problem's conditions. Therefore, the final total time including the coffee shop time is 204 minutes.
