Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_27
proposed answer: We know from sub-task 4 that the maximal four-digit integer N satisfying the property is N = 5694.
Step 1: Compute Q = ⌊N/1000⌋. Dividing 5694 by 1000 gives 5.694, so the integer part is Q = 5.
Step 2: Compute R = N mod 1000. The remainder when 5694 is divided by 1000 is 5694 − 5·1000 = 5694 − 5000 = 694, so R = 694.
Step 3: Compute Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.
Therefore, the required sum is 699.
