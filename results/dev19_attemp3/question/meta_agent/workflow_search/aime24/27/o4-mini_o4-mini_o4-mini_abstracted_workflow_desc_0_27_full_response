Replacing digit d_i at place value 10^{4−i} yields the constraint N + (1−d_i)·10^{4−i} ≡ 0 mod 7, which is equivalent to N ≡ c_i·(d_i−1) mod 7 for each i, where c₁=1000≡6, c₂=100≡2, c₃=10≡3, c₄=1≡1 mod 7. Thus we have four congruences: N≡6(d₁−1), N≡2(d₂−1), N≡3(d₃−1), N≡1(d₄−1) mod 7. Let r≡N mod 7. Then d₁≡6r+1, d₂≡4r+1, d₃≡5r+1, d₄≡r+1 mod 7, with d₁∈1…9, d₂,d₃,d₄∈0…9.

Writing N mod7 via place‐values: 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1, the four conditions become the linear congruences (mod7):\n(1) 6+2d2+3d3+d4≡0 → 2d2+3d3+d4≡1\n(2) 6d1+2+3d3+d4≡0 →6d1+3d3+d4≡5\n(3) 6d1+2d2+3+d4≡0 →6d1+2d2+d4≡4\n(4) 6d1+2d2+3d3+1≡0 →6d1+2d2+3d3≡6.\nSubtracting yields d4≡3d3−2 and d4≡2d2−1, so 3d3−2≡2d2−1 →2d2−3d3≡6.

Let the digits of N be d1d2d3d4.  Replacing position i by 1 changes N by (1−di)·10^{4−i}.  For the result to be divisible by 7, (di−1)·10^{4−i}≡0 (mod 7).  Compute 10 mod 7=3, so: 10^3≡27≡6, 10^2≡9≡2, 10^1≡3, 10^0≡1.  Since 6,2,3,1 are invertible mod 7, each congruence implies di≡1 (mod 7).  The only decimal digits ≡1 mod 7 are 1 and 8.  For d1 (thousands) we cannot have 0, so its options are {1,8} as well.  All four positions must be in {1,8}.  The Cartesian product gives 16 candidates; the largest is 8888.

Let N mod 7=r.  Changing dᵢ→1 adds Δᵢ=(1−dᵢ)·10^{4−i}.  The condition is N+Δᵢ≡0 mod 7 ⇒r+(1−dᵢ)·cᵢ≡0 mod 7, where c₁=1000≡6, c₂=100≡2, c₃=10≡3, c₄=1.  Equivalently (dᵢ−1)·cᵢ≡r mod 7.  Since cᵢ are invertible, each gives dᵢ≡1+cᵢ^{−1}·r.  Compute inverses mod 7: 6^{−1}≡6, 2^{−1}≡4, 3^{−1}≡5, 1^{−1}≡1.  Hence\n d₁≡1+6r,  d₂≡1+4r,  d₃≡1+5r,  d₄≡1+r  (all mod 7).\nFor each r=0…6 determine decimal digits in [0…9] (and d₁≠0) matching these residues:\n r=0→residues {1,8} for any congruence of form ≡1; but numbers ≡1 mod 7 are {1,8}.\n r=1→residues {2,9}\n r=2→{3}\n r=3→{4}\n r=4→{5}\n r=5→{6}\n r=6→{7}\nTest each r for feasibility and find digits sets.
