Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: The greatest four-digit number N identified is 9435. To find Q and R, we divide N by 1000. Dividing 9435 by 1000 gives a quotient Q = 9 and a remainder R = 435 because 9435 = 9 * 1000 + 435. The problem asks for Q + R, so we add these two values: 9 + 435 = 444.

proposed answer: The greatest valid number N identified in Sub-task 3 is 5624. We need to find Q and R such that when N is divided by 1000, N = 1000*Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder. Dividing 5624 by 1000, we get Q = 5 (since 1000*5 = 5000) and R = 624 (since 5624 - 5000 = 624). The problem asks for Q + R, which is 5 + 624 = 629. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the division algorithm. Since N is verified to be correct and the division is simple, the answer is reliable.
