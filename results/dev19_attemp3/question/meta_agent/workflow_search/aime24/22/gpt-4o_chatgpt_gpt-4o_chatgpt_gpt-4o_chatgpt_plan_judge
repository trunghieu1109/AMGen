Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The valid configuration of the list that satisfies all the given conditions is [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1]. We need to compute the sum of the squares of these integers. The sum of the squares is calculated as follows: 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2. Calculating each term, we have 9^2 = 81 and 1^2 = 1. Therefore, the sum of the squares is 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 246.

proposed answer: We have determined that the valid list configuration that satisfies all the conditions is [9, 9, 9, 6, 3, 3]. This list has a sum of 30, 9 is the unique mode, and the median is (9 + 6)/2 = 7.5, which is not in the list. Now, we need to compute the sum of the squares of the integers in this list. The list is [9, 9, 9, 6, 3, 3]. We calculate the square of each number: 9^2 = 81, 6^2 = 36, 3^2 = 9. The sum of the squares is 3*81 + 36 + 2*9 = 243 + 36 + 18 = 297. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the integers in the list is 297.
