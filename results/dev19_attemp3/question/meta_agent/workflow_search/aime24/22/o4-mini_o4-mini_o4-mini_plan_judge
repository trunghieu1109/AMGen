Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: We have determined the unique valid multiset is [5,7,9,9]. To compute the sum of the squares of its elements: 1. Square each element: 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49, 9^2 = 81, and the other 9^2 = 81. 2. Sum these squares: 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 74 + 162 = 236. No other multiset satisfies the given conditions, so the required sum of squares is 236.
