Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding a list of positive integers with sum 30, unique mode 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The median being an integer not in the list implies the list length is even, and the two middle elements differ by 2, so their average (the median) is an integer missing from the list. The unique mode 9 means 9 appears more times than any other number. Attempts to construct such lists for lengths 4, 6, and 8 fail because either the sum exceeds 30, the mode is not unique, or the median condition is violated. For example, with two 9s and middle elements 8 and 10 to get median 9, the sum is already 36, exceeding 30. Reducing elements or changing values to meet all conditions simultaneously is impossible. Therefore, no list satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Since no valid list exists, the sum of squares cannot be computed. This conclusion is consistent with all previous analyses and answers.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, the valid lists must be even-length lists of positive integers summing to 30, with 9 as the unique mode (9 appears more times than any other number), and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The median for an even-length list is the average of the two middle elements, which must be distinct integers whose average is an integer not in the list. To find such lists, consider the frequency of 9 must be at least 2 (to be unique mode), and the sum of all elements is 30. The two middle elements must be distinct integers a and b, with (a+b)/2 = m, where m is a positive integer not in the list. Since 9 is the unique mode, no other number appears as frequently as 9. By testing possible combinations, one valid list is [1, 4, 9, 9, 7], but this sums to 30? 1+4+9+9+7=30, length 5 (odd), so median is the middle element 9, which is in the list, so invalid. So length must be even. Try length 6: The two middle elements are positions 3 and 4. Letâ€™s try to find such a list. Suppose the two middle elements are 7 and 8, median is 7.5 (not integer). Try 6 and 8, median 7 (integer). If 7 is not in the list, then median 7 is not in the list. So middle elements 6 and 8, median 7 not in list. Now, 9 must be unique mode. So 9 appears more times than any other number. Suppose 9 appears twice. Then no other number appears twice or more. So the list could be [2, 6, 8, 9, 9, 5]. Sum is 2+6+8+9+9+5=39 >30. Try smaller numbers. Try [1, 6, 8, 9, 9, 5] sum=1+6+8+9+9+5=38 >30. Try [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 5] sum=1+4+8+9+9+5=36 >30. Try [1, 3, 8, 9, 9, 5] sum=1+3+8+9+9+5=35 >30. Try [1, 2, 8, 9, 9, 5] sum=1+2+8+9+9+5=34 >30. Try [1, 2, 6, 9, 9, 5] sum=1+2+6+9+9+5=32 >30. Try [1, 2, 6, 9, 9, 3] sum=1+2+6+9+9+3=30. Middle elements are 6 and 9 (positions 3 and 4). Median is (6+9)/2=7.5 not integer. So invalid. Try middle elements 5 and 9, median 7 (integer). List: [1, 2, 5, 9, 9, 4] sum=1+2+5+9+9+4=30. Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Middle elements 4 and 5, median 4.5 not integer. So invalid. Try middle elements 5 and 7, median 6 (integer). List: [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 9] sum=1+2+5+7+9+9=33 >30. Try [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 9] sum=31 >30. Try [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 9] sum=30. Sorted: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Middle elements 3 and 6, median 4.5 not integer. Invalid. Try middle elements 4 and 6, median 5 (integer). List: [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 9] sum=31 >30. Try [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9] sum=29 <30. Try [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10] sum=30 but 9 is not unique mode. Try [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9] sum=29. Try [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9, 9] sum=38 >30. Try length 4: middle elements positions 2 and 3. Try [6, 7, 9, 8] sum=30, sorted [6,7,8,9], middle elements 7 and 8, median 7.5 not integer. Try [5, 7, 9, 9] sum=30, sorted [5,7,9,9], middle elements 7 and 9, median 8 integer. 8 not in list. 9 appears twice, 7 once, 5 once. 9 unique mode. Conditions met. So valid list: [5,7,9,9]. Sum of squares: 25+49+81+81=236. Try other lists with similar pattern: [4,8,9,9] sum=30, sorted [4,8,9,9], middle elements 8 and 9, median 8.5 not integer. Invalid. [3,9,9,9] sum=30, sorted [3,9,9,9], middle elements 9 and 9, median 9 in list, invalid. So only [5,7,9,9] valid. Sum of squares is 236. Therefore, the sum of squares of all items in the identified valid list(s) is 236.
