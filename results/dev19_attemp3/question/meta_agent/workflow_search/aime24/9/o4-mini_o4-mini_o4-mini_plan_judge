Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We want the probability that Jen wins the grand prize (all 4 of her picked numbers match the 4 drawn) given that she wins any prize (at least 2 matches).  

1. Total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4)=210.  
2. For k matches between Jen’s 4 numbers and the draw, the number of favorable draws is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k), since we choose k of Jen’s and the remaining 4−k from the 6 she didn’t pick.  
   - k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90  
   - k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24  
   - k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1  
3. The number of draws with at least 2 matches is 90+24+1=115.  
4. Thus P(at least 2 matches)=115/210, which simplifies by 5 to 23/42.  
5. The probability of a grand prize (4 matches) is 1/210.  
6. The conditional probability is (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23).  Simplify 42/210=1/5, giving 1/(5*23)=1/115.  
7. In lowest terms, m=1 and n=115, so m+n=1+115=116.
