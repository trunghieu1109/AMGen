Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To find the conditional probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, we need to consider the number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize and the total number of outcomes for winning any prize. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. We have already calculated that there are 115 ways for Jen to win a prize. Jen wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers are the randomly chosen numbers. The number of ways for Jen to win the grand prize is 1, because there is only one way for her chosen four numbers to match exactly the four drawn numbers. The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win any prize. Therefore, the probability is 1/115. To express this probability in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime, we have m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
