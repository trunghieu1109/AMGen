Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. From the previous sub-tasks, we know the total number of 4-element subsets from the set S of size 10 is C(10,4) = 210. Jen's chosen subset J has 4 distinct numbers. The number of subsets that have exactly k elements in common with J are: 90 for k=2, 24 for k=3, and 1 for k=4. Winning the grand prize means the randomly chosen subset exactly matches Jen's chosen subset, so there is only 1 favorable outcome for the grand prize. Winning any prize means the intersection size is at least 2, so the total favorable outcomes for winning any prize are 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize is 1/210, and the probability of winning any prize is 115/210. The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize is P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form since 1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1. Hence, the conditional probability is 1/115, and the sum m + n where the fraction is m/n is 1 + 115 = 116. This conclusion is consistent across all agents and is mathematically sound, following the standard rules of conditional probability and combinatorics.
