Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves coloring the vertices of a regular octagon and determining the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The probability was found to be 35/128. To ensure this fraction is in its simplest form, we check if 35 and 128 are coprime. The prime factorization of 35 is 5 * 7, and the prime factorization of 128 is 2^7. Since they have no common factors other than 1, they are coprime. Therefore, the fraction 35/128 is already simplified, with m = 35 and n = 128. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 35 + 128.

proposed answer: The problem involves coloring the vertices of a regular octagon and determining the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The probability was calculated to be 36/256. To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 256, which is 4. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4 gives us 9/64. We verify that 9 and 64 are coprime by noting that 9 is 3^2 and 64 is 2^6, so they have no common prime factors. Therefore, the fraction 9/64 is in its simplest form. The problem asks for the sum m+n, where m=9 and n=64, so m+n=73.
