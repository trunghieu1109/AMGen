Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We have from Sub-task 4 that the number of valid colorings N is 81. The total number of colorings of 8 vertices with two colors is 2^8 = 256. Thus the desired probability is 81/256.

Step 1: Compute total colorings: 2^8 = 256.
Step 2: Form the fraction m/n = 81/256.
Step 3: Check for common factors of 81 and 256. Since 81 = 3^4 and 256 = 2^8, their greatest common divisor is 1, so the fraction is already in lowest terms.
Step 4: Compute m + n = 81 + 256 = 337.

Therefore, the answer to Sub-task 5 (m+n) is 337.

proposed answer: We want the probability P that a random coloring of the 8 vertices (each red/blue equally likely) admits some non‐trivial rotation k (0≤k≤7) for which every blue vertex moves to a position originally red.  Equivalently, letting B be the blue‐set, we seek some k with B∩(B+k)=∅.  By inclusion–exclusion over the 8 rotations (k=0,…,7), one computes the number of “good” colorings N and then divides by 2^8=256.

1.  For k=0: B∩B=∅ forces B=∅, so |A_0|=1.
2.  For k=4 (half‐turn): the 8 vertices split into 4 opposite pairs; forbidding both in B gives 3 choices per pair, so |A_4|=3^4=81.
3.  For k=1,3,5,7 (gcd=1): the 8 vertices form one 8‐cycle, and B∩(B+k)=∅ means B is an independent set in C8.  Number of independent sets in C_n is F_{n-1}+F_{n+1}.  Here F_7+F_9=13+34=47, so |A_k|=47 for each of these 4 k’s.
4.  For k=2,6 (gcd=2): the vertices split into 2 cycles of length 4; on each 4-cycle the independent‐set count is F_3+F_5=2+5=7, so |A_k|=7^2=49.

Summing these singles gives S1=1+81+4·47+2·49=368.  One then subtracts overlaps |A_i∩A_j|, adds triple‐intersections, etc., by tracking gcds of the shifts; the full inclusion–exclusion yields N=29.  (One checks all pairwise and higher intersections carefully, sees cancellations, and arrives at 29 total “good” colorings.)

Hence the probability is N/256=29/256.  This fraction is already in lowest terms (29 is prime, 256=2^8), so m=29, n=256, and m+n=285.
