Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: We begin with the standard coordinate placement that has proven consistent in prior sub‐tasks:
1. Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(AB,0), C=(AB,BC), D=(0,BC).
2. Since D,E,C,F are collinear on the horizontal line y=BC, let E=(p,BC) and F=(p+EF,BC).
3. Complete rectangle EFGH by placing G=(p+EF,BC+FG) and H=(p,BC+FG).

Next we enforce that A, D, H, G are concyclic.  A general circle through A=(0,0) can be written
   x^2 + y^2 + u x + v y = 0.
Plugging D=(0,BC) gives
   0^2 + BC^2 + u·0 + v·BC = 0  ⇒  v = –BC.
So the circle equation becomes
   x^2 + y^2 + u x – BC·y = 0.

Now impose that H=(p,BC+FG) lies on the circle:
   p^2 + (BC+FG)^2 + u·p – BC·(BC+FG) = 0.        (1)
Also impose G=(p+EF,BC+FG) lies on the same circle:
   (p+EF)^2 + (BC+FG)^2 + u·(p+EF) – BC·(BC+FG) = 0.  (2)

Subtract (1) from (2) to eliminate the common constant terms:
   [ (p+EF)^2 – p^2 ] + u·EF = 0
   ⇒ (p^2 + 2·EF·p + EF^2 – p^2) + u·EF = 0
   ⇒ 2·EF·p + EF^2 + u·EF = 0
   ⇒ u·EF = –2·EF·p – EF^2
   ⇒ u = –2·p – EF.                                    (3)

Substitute u from (3) back into equation (1):
   p^2 + (BC+FG)^2 + (–2p–EF)·p – BC·(BC+FG) = 0
   ⇒ p^2 + (BC+FG)^2 – 2p^2 – EF·p – BC·(BC+FG) = 0
   ⇒ –p^2 – EF·p + [ (BC+FG)^2 – BC·(BC+FG) ] = 0.
Note that  (BC+FG)^2 – BC·(BC+FG) = (BC+FG)[(BC+FG) – BC] = (BC+FG)·FG.
So the equation simplifies to
   –p^2 – EF·p + FG·(BC+FG) = 0
Multiply by –1:
   p^2 + EF·p – FG·(BC+FG) = 0.

This is a quadratic in p.  Its solutions are
   p = [ –EF ± √(EF^2 + 4·FG·(BC+FG)) ] / 2.
Because E must lie between D=(0,BC) and C=(AB,BC) with 0 < p < AB, we choose the root with the “+” inside the radical but the leading “–EF” sign, i.e.
   p = [ –EF + √(EF^2 + 4·FG·(BC+FG)) ] / 2.

Finally CE is the horizontal distance from C=(AB,BC) to E=(p,BC), namely
   CE = |AB – p|.  Since p < AB we have CE = AB – p = AB – [ –EF + √(EF^2 + 4·FG·(BC+FG)) ]/2
         = [ 2·AB + EF – √(EF^2 + 4·FG·(BC+FG)) ] / 2.

Plug in the given numeric values AB=107, BC=16, EF=184, FG=17:
   FG·(BC+FG) = 17·(16+17) = 17·33 = 561.
   EF^2 + 4·561 = 184^2 + 2244 = 33856 + 2244 = 36100, so √(...) = 190.
Then
   CE = [ 2·107 + 184 – 190 ] / 2 = [214 + 184 – 190] / 2 = 208 / 2 = 104.

No other choice of sign or extraneous root satisfies 0 < p < AB, so the unique valid length is 104.
