Here is the step‐by‐step justification:\n\n1. Working in the multiplicative group G = (ℤ/pℤ)*, which is cyclic of order p–1, a solution x exists exactly when –1 lies in the subgroup of 4th powers in G.\n\n2. Let g be a primitive root modulo p, so every nonzero residue is g^k for some k.  Then x ≡ g^a gives x^4 ≡ g^{4a}, and –1 ≡ g^{(p–1)/2}.  The congruence x^4 ≡ –1 becomes\n   4a ≡ (p–1)/2   (mod p–1).\n\n3. A linear congruence m·a ≡ b (mod M) has a solution iff gcd(m,M) divides b.  Here m=4, M=p–1, b=(p–1)/2.  So we need d = gcd(4,p–1) to divide (p–1)/2.\n\n4. Since p is odd, p–1 is even, so d is 2 or 4.  \n   • If d=2, then 2|((p–1)/2) always holds, but d=2 means p–1 ≡ 2 (mod 4) so p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  In that case –1 is not even a square mod p, contradiction to being a 4th power.\n   • If d=4, then 4|((p–1)/2) is required, i.e. p–1 ≡ 0 (mod 8), which is equivalent to p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\n\n5. Thus the only odd primes admitting a solution are those with p ≡ 1 (mod 8).  (The case p=2 is excluded by the original divisibility condition n^4+1 ≡ 0 (mod 4), which has no integer solutions.)\n\nConclusion: All and only the primes p satisfying p ≡ 1 mod 8 allow x^4 ≡ –1 (mod p) to be solvable.; answer - The possible primes p are exactly those congruent to 1 modulo 8.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We already determined in Sub-task 2 that the only odd primes p admitting a solution x₀ to x₀⁴≡−1 (mod p) are those with p≡1 (mod 8).  To check which of these allow lifting to a solution modulo p², we apply Hensel’s lemma to f(x)=x⁴+1:  \n\n1.  Suppose p≡1 (mod 8) and x₀ satisfies x₀⁴+1≡0 (mod p).  Then p is an odd prime and p∤x₀ (since −1≠0 (mod p)).\n2.  Compute f′(x)=4x³; hence f′(x₀)=4x₀³.  Because p∤4 and p∤x₀, we have f′(x₀)≢0 (mod p).  This shows x₀ is a simple root of f(x) modulo p.\n3.  Hensel’s lemma guarantees that every simple root modulo p lifts uniquely to a root modulo p².  No extra congruence conditions on p arise beyond p being odd and not dividing f′(x₀), both of which hold for all p≡1 (mod 8).\n4.  Therefore every prime p≡1 (mod 8) that admits x⁴≡−1 (mod p) also admits an integer solution to x⁴≡−1 (mod p²).

Since (ℤ/pℤ)* is cyclic of order p−1, choose a generator g.  Then every nonzero residue is g^k for some k, and  x^4≡−1 means (g^a)^4≡g^{(p−1)/2}, so 4a≡(p−1)/2 (mod p−1).  This linear congruence in a has a solution if and only if gcd(4,p−1) divides (p−1)/2.  Note gcd(4,p−1) can be 1,2 or 4.  For p>2, p is odd so p−1 is even and gcd(4,p−1) is 2 or 4.  If gcd(4,p−1)=2 then 2|(p−1)/2 always holds, but then p−1≡2 mod4 so p≡3 mod4 and −1 is not even a square, contradiction to it being a fourth power.  Thus we need gcd(4,p−1)=4, i.e. p−1≡0 mod4 (so p≡1 mod4), and moreover 4|(p−1)/2, i.e. p−1≡0 mod8.  Hence p≡1 mod8.  In that case the congruence has exactly four solutions for x.  No other odd primes work, and p=2 fails for fourth‐power divisibility by 4.  Therefore the primes p for which x^4≡−1 (mod p) is solvable are exactly those with p≡1 mod8.; answer: The possible primes p are exactly those satisfying p≡1 (mod 8).\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision Agent cKoR, selecting primes, thinking: We need to find all primes p for which the congruence x^4 ≡ –1 (mod p) has a solution.  Here is the step‐by‐step justification:\n\n1. Working in the multiplicative group G = (ℤ/pℤ)*, which is cyclic of order p–1, a solution x exists exactly when –1 lies in the subgroup of 4th powers in G.\n\n2. Let g be a primitive root modulo p, so every nonzero residue is g^k for some k.  Then x ≡ g^a gives x^4 ≡ g^{4a}, and –1 ≡ g^{(p–1)/2}.  The congruence x^4 ≡ –1 becomes\n   4a ≡ (p–1)/2   (mod p–1).\n\n3. A linear congruence m·a ≡ b (mod M) has a solution iff gcd(m,M) divides b.  Here m=4, M=p–1, b=(p–1)/2.  So we need d = gcd(4,p–1) to divide (p–1)/2.\n\n4. Since p is odd, p–1 is even, so d is 2 or 4.  \n   • If d=2, then 2|((p–1)/2) always holds, but d=2 means p–1 ≡ 2 (mod 4) so p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  In that case –1 is not even a square mod p, contradiction to being a 4th power.\n   • If d=4, then 4|((p–1)/2) is required, i.e. p–1 ≡ 0 (mod 8), which is equivalent to p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\n\n5. Thus the only odd primes admitting a solution are those with p ≡ 1 (mod 8).  (The case p=2 is excluded by the original divisibility condition n^4+1 ≡ 0 (mod 4), which has no integer solutions.)\n\nConclusion: All and only the primes p satisfying p ≡ 1 mod 8 allow x^4 ≡ –1 (mod p) to be solvable.; answer: The possible primes p are exactly those congruent to 1 modulo 8.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent ab0O, round 0, thinking: We seek primes p for which a solution x0 mod p of x^4≡−1 lifts to mod p^2.  By Hensel’s lemma, such a lift exists (and is unique) whenever f′(x0)≢0 mod p, where f(x)=x^4+1.  Here f′(x)=4x^3.  If p divides f(x0) then x0^4≡−1 mod p, so p∤x0 (since −1≢0 mod p).  Also p is odd (we already found p≡1 mod 8>2), so p∤4.  Hence 4x0^3≢0 mod p.  Thus every solution mod p lifts uniquely to mod p^2.  Since we showed in Sub‐task 2 that precisely the primes p≡1 mod 8 admit any solution to x^4≡−1 mod p, it follows that all such p allow a lift to x^4≡−1 mod p^2.; answer: All primes p≡1 (mod 8) allow lifting any solution of x^4≡−1 mod p to a solution mod p^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent fdAo, round 0, thinking: We start with the known necessary condition: a solution x0 of x^4 ≡ –1 (mod p) exists precisely for primes p ≡ 1 (mod 8).  To lift such a solution to mod p^2, we apply Hensel’s lemma to f(x)=x^4+1.  Hensel’s criterion asks that f(x0)≡0 (mod p) and f′(x0)𝚗𝚘𝚝≡0 (mod p).  Here f′(x)=4x^3, so f′(x0)=4x0^3.  Since p is an odd prime not dividing 4, and x0 is invertible mod p (because x0^4≡–1≠0 mod p), we have gcd(f′(x0),p)=1.  Therefore each root modulo p lifts uniquely to a root modulo p^2.  No further congruence conditions on p appear.  Thus every prime p for which x^4≡–1 has a mod-p solution (those p≡1 mod 8) also permits lifting that solution to mod p^2.; answer: All primes p congruent to 1 modulo 8 allow lifting a solution from mod p to mod p^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent TWOT, round 0, thinking: We begin with the set of candidate primes from Sub-task 2: those odd primes p≡1\u2009(mod\u20098) for which there exists x₀ with x₀^4≡−1\u2009(mod\u2009p).  We wish to know for which of these primes one can lift x₀ (mod\u2009p) to a solution x₁ (mod\u2009p²) of x^4≡−1.  By the standard (Hensel) lifting criterion for a polynomial f(x)=x^4+1 over ℤ, a simple root mod\u2009p (i.e. f(x₀)≡0\u2009(mod\u2009p)) lifts uniquely to mod\u2009p² provided f′(x₀)≠0\u2009(mod\u2009p).  \n\n1.  f(x)=x^4+1  ⇒  f′(x)=4x^3.\n2.

Then p is an odd prime and p∤x₀ (since −1≠0 (mod p)).\n2.  Compute f′(x)=4x³; hence f′(x₀)=4x₀³.  Because p∤4 and p∤x₀, we have f′(x₀)≢0 (mod p).

No extra congruence conditions on p arise beyond p being odd and not dividing f′(x₀), both of which hold for all p≡1 (mod 8).\n4.
