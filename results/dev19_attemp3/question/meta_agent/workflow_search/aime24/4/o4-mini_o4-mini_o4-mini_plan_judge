proposed answer: We seek the smallest positive integer m such that m^4≡−1 (mod 17^2), where 17 is the least prime p for which n^4+1 is divisible by p^2.  The standard method is:

1. Solve x^4≡−1 mod 17.  Since (ℤ/17ℤ)* has order 16, the equation x^4≡16 has exactly four solutions.  Testing small residues mod 17 yields:
   • 2^4=16, (−2)^4=16; 8^4≡4096≡16; (−8)^4≡16.  Thus x≡2,15,8,9 mod 17.

2. Each simple root x₀ mod 17 lifts uniquely via Hensel’s lemma to a root x mod 289=17^2, because f(x)=x^4+1 has derivative f′(x)=4x^3 which is not 0 mod 17 at any root.

3. Write x=x₀+17k and expand f(x) modulo 289:
   f(x)=x₀^4+4x₀^3·17k (mod 289), since higher terms are multiples of 289.
   We require x₀^4+4·x₀^3·17k≡−1≡288 (mod 289).

4. For each x₀:
   a) x₀=2: 2^4=16; 4·2^3·17=544≡255.  Solve 16+255k≡288 ⇒255k≡272⇒divide by17⇒15k≡16 (mod 17)⇒k≡9⇒x=2+17·9=155.
   b) x₀=15: 15^4≡50; 4·15^3·17≡1768≡34.  50+34k≡288⇒34k≡238⇒÷17⇒2k≡14⇒k≡7⇒x=15+17·7=134.
   c) x₀=8: 8^4≡50; 4·8^3·17≡34816≡136.  50+136k≡288⇒136k≡238⇒÷17⇒8k≡14⇒k≡6⇒x=8+17·6=110.
   d) x₀=9: 9^4≡203; 4·9^3·17≡49572≡153.  203+153k≡288⇒153k≡85⇒÷17⇒9k≡5⇒k≡10⇒x=9+17·10=179.

5. The four lifts mod 289 are {110,134,155,179}.  The least positive is m=110.
