Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_15
proposed answer: We have the following variables and equations from the problem: Variables: a, b, c (own exactly two items including candy hearts), d, e, f (own exactly three items including candy hearts), x (own all four items), y (own only candy hearts). Equations: 1) a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items) 2) d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items) 3) y + x = 229 (only candy hearts or all four items) 4) a + d + e + x = 195 (own diamond ring) 5) b + d + f + x = 367 (own golf clubs) 6) c + e + f + x = 562 (own garden spade) We want to find x. First, add equations (4), (5), and (6): (a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Left side: a + b + c + 2(d + e + f) + 3x. Substitute a + b + c = 437 and d + e + f = 234: 437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124. Calculate: 437 + 468 + 3x = 1124 => 905 + 3x = 1124 => 3x = 219 => x = 73. So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73. This satisfies all given constraints and is consistent with the problem data.
