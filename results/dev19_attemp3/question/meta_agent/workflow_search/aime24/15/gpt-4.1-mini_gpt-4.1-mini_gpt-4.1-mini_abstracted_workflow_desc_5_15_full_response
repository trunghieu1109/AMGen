Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Thus:\n- Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items (D, G, or S).\n- Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items.\n\nHence, the possible ownership combinations are based on subsets of {D, G, S} with candy hearts always included.\n\nEnumerating all possible ownership combinations:\n1.

The other three items (D, G, S) vary among residents.\n\nWe want to clarify the meaning of \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' items owned, considering that candy hearts is owned by all.\n\n- Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items.

Additionally, 437 own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. We need to clarify and enumerate all possible ownership combinations of these four items, considering that candy hearts is owned by all residents.\n\nSince C is owned by everyone, the minimum number of items owned by any resident is 1 (just C). The maximum is 4 (D, G, S, and C).\n\nPossible ownership combinations (subsets) of the four items are:\n- Exactly 1 item: only C (since everyone owns C, this means owning only candy hearts and none of D, G, S)\n- Exactly 2 items: C plus exactly one of D, G, or S.

The problem states there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of these things. Since candy hearts is owned by all, the number of items owned by each resident is at least one (C).

Since candy hearts (C) is owned by all, \'exactly two items\' means candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}, and \'exactly three items\' means candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. We can organize the data as follows: 1. Total residents: 900 2. Ownership counts of individual items (excluding candy hearts since all own it): - D: 195 - G: 367 - S: 562 3. Counts of residents owning exactly k items: - Exactly 1 item (only candy hearts): unknown (to be calculated if needed) - Exactly 2 items (C + exactly one of D, G, S): 437 - Exactly 3 items (C + exactly two of D, G, S): 234 - Exactly 4 items (C + D + G + S): unknown (to be calculated if needed) Structuring the data this way clarifies the ownership distribution and sets a foundation for further analysis or solving for unknowns like the number of residents owning all four items or only candy hearts. This structured aggregation respects the problemâ€™s interpretation that candy hearts is universally owned and the counts of residents owning exactly two or three items correspond to ownership of candy hearts plus subsets of {D, G, S}.; answer: {\'Total residents\': 900, \'Individual item ownership counts\': {\'Diamond ring (D)\': 195, \'Golf clubs (G)\': 367, \'Garden spade (S)\': 562, \'Candy hearts (C)\': 900}, \'Counts of residents owning exactly k items\': {\'Exactly 1 item (C only)\': \'unknown\', \'Exactly 2 items (C + exactly one of {D, G, S})\': 437, \'Exactly 3 items (C + exactly two of {D, G, S})\': 234, \'Exactly 4 items (C + D + G + S)\': \'unknown\'}}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 3mea, aggregating data, thinking: The problem involves four items: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C).

Candy hearts is owned by all 900 residents, so every resident owns C. The other three items are owned by subsets of the population: D by 195, G by 367, and S by 562. The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two items and 234 own exactly three items. Since everyone owns C, owning exactly two items means owning C plus exactly one of {D, G, S}, and owning exactly three items means owning C plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. Owning exactly one item means owning only C (and none of D, G, S), and owning exactly four items means owning C plus all three D, G, and S. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items (C, D, G, S), and y be the number owning only C. The total number of residents is 900, so the sum of residents owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items equals 900: y + 437 + 234 + x = 900. Next, we analyze the counts of owners of each item. The number of residents owning D is 195, which includes those owning D only with C (exactly two items where D is the extra item), those owning D and one other of {G, S} with C (exactly three items where D is one of the two extra items), and those owning all four items (x). Similarly for G and S. Letâ€™s define: a = number owning exactly two items with D (C + D only), b = number owning exactly two items with G (C + G only), c = number owning exactly two items with S (C + S only). Since exactly two items owners total 437, a + b + c = 437. Let d = number owning exactly three items with D and G (C + D + G), e = number owning exactly three items with D and S (C + D + S), f = number owning exactly three items with G and S (C + G + S). Since exactly three items owners total 234, d + e + f = 234. Then, from the individual item counts: For D: a + d + e + x = 195; for G: b + d + f + x = 367; for S: c + e + f + x = 562. We now have 6 equations: a + b + c = 437; d + e + f = 234; a + d + e + x = 195; b + d + f + x = 367; c + e + f + x = 562; y + 437 + 234 + x = 900. These equations relate the unknowns a,b,c,d,e,f,x,y to known quantities. They express the ownership overlaps using inclusion-exclusion principles and the structured data, allowing for solving the unknowns in terms of known quantities.

First, add equations (4), (5), and (6): (a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Left side: a + b + c + 2(d + e + f) + 3x. Substitute a + b + c = 437 and d + e + f = 234: 437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124. Calculate: 437 + 468 + 3x = 1124 => 905 + 3x = 1124 => 3x = 219 => x = 73.
