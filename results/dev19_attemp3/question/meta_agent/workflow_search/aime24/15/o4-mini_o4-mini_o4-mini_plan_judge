Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_9_15
proposed answer: To find x4 (the number owning all four items), we apply the principle of inclusion–exclusion to the four sets D, G, S, C over 900 people, using the given counts for exactly two (E2=437) and exactly three (E3=234).

1. Notation:
   • |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900
   • S2 = sum of all six pairwise intersections
   • S3 = sum of all four triple intersections
   • x4 = |D∩G∩S∩C|

2. Inclusion–Exclusion for four sets:
   |D∪G∪S∪C| = (|D|+|G|+|S|+|C|) – S2 + S3 – x4.
   Since every resident owns at least one item, |D∪G∪S∪C|=900.

3. Sum of singles:
   |D|+|G|+|S|+|C| = 195+367+562+900 = 2024.
   Hence 900 = 2024 – S2 + S3 – x4  ⇒  S2 – S3 + x4 = 2024 – 900 = 1124.   (Eq A)

4. Express S2 and S3 in terms of E2, E3, x4:
   • A person owning exactly two items contributes 1 to S2; exactly three contributes 3; all four contributes 6. Thus
     S2 = E2 + 3·E3 + 6·x4 = 437 + 3·234 + 6·x4 = 437 + 702 + 6x4 = 1139 + 6x4.
   • A person owning exactly three items contributes 1 to S3; all four contributes 4. Thus
     S3 = E3 + 4·x4 = 234 + 4x4.

5. Substitute into Eq A:
   (1139 + 6x4) – (234 + 4x4) + x4 = 1124
   ⇒ 1139 – 234 + (6x4 – 4x4 + x4) = 1124
   ⇒ 905 + 3x4 = 1124
   ⇒ 3x4 = 1124 – 905 = 219
   ⇒ x4 = 219/3 = 73.

6. Check integrality and feasibility: 73 is a nonnegative integer ≤ 195, 367, 562, 900, so it is valid.
