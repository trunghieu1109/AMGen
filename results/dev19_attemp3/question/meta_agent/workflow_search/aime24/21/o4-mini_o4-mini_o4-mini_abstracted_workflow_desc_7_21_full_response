You are not required to answer the question — just follow what is defined in the instruction: Sub-task 7: Sum the rectangle counts from Sub-task 6 over all direction pairs to obtain the total number of rectangles..   \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 6: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide the rectangle count for each perpendicular direction pair. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent NnMh:\nWe count rectangles for one perpendicular direction pair, say (0°,90°), then apply symmetry to the other two pairs. A rectangle is determined by choosing two horizontal chords (parallel to 0°) at y‐levels and two vertical chords (parallel to 90°) at x‐levels. There are 5 possible chords in each direction, with chord lengths: at levels ±√3/2: length 1; at ±1/2: length √3; at 0: length 2. Label the lengths A=1 (2 chords), B=√3 (2 chords), C=2 (1 chord).\n\nStep 1. Horizontal‐chord pairs: C(5,2)=10.  Each pair has minimum length Lmin.  The intersection of their x‐ranges has half‐width Mx=Lmin/2.  Only vertical chords whose x‐coordinate |x|≤Mx can serve as sides.  For each such chord, its y‐range (half‐length L′/2) must cover the two chosen y‐levels; one checks that all these vertical chords do cover them.  Then the number of vertical‐chord pairs is C(k,2) where k=#allowed vertical chords.\n\nStep 2. Tally by horizontal‐length types:  \n• Pairs with min=A(1): there are 7 of these.  Then Mx=½, so allowed vertical chords are at x∈{−½,0,½} (3 chords), giving C(3,2)=3 rectangles each.  Total =7×3=21.\n• Pairs with min=B(√3): there are 3 of these.  Then Mx=√3/2≈0.866, so allowed vertical chords are all 5 (at x=±0.866,±0.5,0), giving C(5,2)=10 each.  Total =3×10=30.\n\nThus for (0°,90°), total =21+30=51 rectangles.  By 12‐fold rotational symmetry of the regular dodecagon, the other two perpendicular pairs, (30°,120°) and (60°,150°), each also yield 51 rectangles.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent NnMh:\n{\'(0°,90°)\': 51, \'(30°,120°)\': 51, \'(60°,150°)\': 51}\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Sum the rectangle counts from Sub-task 6 over all direction pairs to obtain the total number of rectangles. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.
