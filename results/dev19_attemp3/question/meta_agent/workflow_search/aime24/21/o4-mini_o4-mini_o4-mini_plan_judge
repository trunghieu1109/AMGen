Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To count all rectangles whose sides lie along two fixed perpendicular direction‐classes, note:

1. In a regular 12‐gon there are exactly 6 direction‐classes of sides/diagonals: 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150° (mod 180°).  The three perpendicular pairs are (0°,90°), (30°,120°), (60°,150°).

2. Fix any one perpendicular pair, say (0°,90°).  “0°” chords are all horizontal lines through two vertices; “90°” chords are vertical lines through two vertices.
   •  By symmetry of the regular 12‐gon, for each of these two directions there are 5 parallel chords (one for each distinct constant coordinate among the 12 vertices).
   •  To form a rectangle with sides on these lines, choose any 2 of the 5 horizontal chords and any 2 of the 5 vertical chords.  Their 4 intersections form a rectangle.
   •  The number of rectangles in this direction‐pair is C(5,2)·C(5,2) = 10·10 = 100.

3. The same count holds for the other two perpendicular pairs, (30°,120°) and (60°,150°), again by rotational symmetry.

4. Summing over all three perpendicular direction‐pairs gives 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we found that for each perpendicular direction pair—namely (0°, 90°), (30°, 120°), and (60°, 150°)—there are 51 rectangles.  These are the only three orthogonal direction pairs in a regular 12-gon since sides and diagonals occur in 12 equally spaced directions, yielding 6 directions and hence 3 orthogonal pairs.

Step 1: List the three orthogonal direction pairs:
 1. (0°, 90°)
 2. (30°, 120°)
 3. (60°, 150°)

Step 2: From Sub-task 6, each of these pairs independently yields 51 rectangles.  The count is identical for each pair by the 12-fold rotational symmetry of the regular dodecagon.

Step 3: Sum over all three pairs:
  Total = 51 + 51 + 51 = 153.

No other perpendicular direction pairs exist (each side or diagonal direction has been paired exactly once), so the grand total of rectangles is 153.
