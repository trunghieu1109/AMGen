proposed answer: To count the total number of valid rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the different ways to select four vertices such that they form a rectangle. In a regular dodecagon, the vertices are labeled A_1, A_2, ..., A_12, and they are evenly spaced around a circle. A rectangle can be formed if opposite sides or diagonals are parallel and equal in length. We consider the following cases: 1) Opposite sides: For example, A_1A_2 and A_7A_8 are opposite sides. Since the dodecagon is regular, these sides are parallel and equal in length, forming a rectangle. There are 6 such pairs of opposite sides. 2) Diagonals skipping 2 vertices: Diagonals like A_1A_4 and A_7A_10 skip two vertices and are parallel and equal in length. There are 6 such pairs. 3) Diagonals skipping 3 vertices: Diagonals like A_1A_5 and A_7A_11 skip three vertices and are parallel and equal in length. There are 6 such pairs. 4) Diagonals skipping 4 vertices: Diagonals like A_1A_6 and A_7A_12 skip four vertices and are parallel and equal in length. There are 6 such pairs. 5) Diagonals skipping 5 vertices: Diagonals like A_1A_7 and A_2A_8 skip five vertices and are parallel and equal in length. There are 6 such pairs. In each case, the opposite sides or diagonals are parallel and equal in length, satisfying the conditions for a rectangle. Therefore, each set of four vertices forms a valid rectangle. The total number of rectangles is 6 (opposite sides) + 6 (diagonals skipping 2 vertices) + 6 (diagonals skipping 3 vertices) + 6 (diagonals skipping 4 vertices) + 6 (diagonals skipping 5 vertices) = 30 rectangles.

proposed answer: To count the total number of valid rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we consider the different types of rectangles that can be formed based on the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, which we can label as A_1, A_2, ..., A_12. The vertices are evenly spaced on a circle. 

1. Rectangles using the sides of the dodecagon: For each vertex A_i, we can form a rectangle using the sides A_iA_{i+1} and A_{i+6}A_{i+7} as opposite sides, and A_{i+1}A_{i+6} and A_iA_{i+7} as the other pair of opposite sides. There are 12 such rectangles, one for each vertex A_i.

2. Rectangles using diagonals that skip 2 vertices: For each vertex A_i, we can form a rectangle using the diagonals A_iA_{i+3} and A_{i+6}A_{i+9} as opposite sides, and A_{i+3}A_{i+6} and A_iA_{i+9} as the other pair of opposite sides. There are 12 such rectangles, one for each vertex A_i.

3. Rectangles using diagonals that skip 4 vertices: For each vertex A_i, we can form a rectangle using the diagonals A_iA_{i+5} and A_{i+6}A_{i+11} as opposite sides, and A_{i+5}A_{i+6} and A_iA_{i+11} as the other pair of opposite sides. There are 12 such rectangles, one for each vertex A_i.

Adding these up, we have 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 rectangles in total. Each set of four points forms a valid rectangle due to the symmetry and regularity of the dodecagon, ensuring that opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.
