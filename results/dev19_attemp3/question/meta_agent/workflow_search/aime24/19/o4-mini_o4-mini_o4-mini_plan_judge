Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: Step 1: By the division algorithm, for any integer N and positive divisor d there are unique integers q (quotient) and r (remainder) with 0 ≤ r < d such that N = dq + r.
Step 2: Here N = 8321 and d = 1000. We compute the quotient q = ⌊8321/1000⌋ = 8, since 8·1000 = 8000 and 9·1000 = 9000 > 8321.
Step 3: Multiply back: 1000 × 8 = 8000.
Step 4: Subtract to find the remainder: r = 8321 − 8000 = 321.
Step 5: Verify that 0 ≤ 321 < 1000, which is true, so 321 is indeed the unique remainder.
Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.
