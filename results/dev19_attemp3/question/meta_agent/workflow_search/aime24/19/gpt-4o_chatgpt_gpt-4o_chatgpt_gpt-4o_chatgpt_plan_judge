Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the remainder of a product involving 13th roots of unity when divided by 1000. The expression given is \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), which simplifies to \((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1\). For \(k = 0\), this evaluates to 1. For \(k = 1\) to 12, \(\omega^k\) are the nontrivial 13th roots of unity. The product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)\) is related to the cyclotomic polynomial \(\Phi_{13}(x)\), specifically \(\Phi_{13}(1)\), which evaluates to 13. The expression \((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1\) is a modification of this product. The product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1)\) can be seen as a power of 13 due to the symmetry and properties of cyclotomic polynomials. The most consistent reasoning is that the product simplifies to a power of 13, specifically \(13^2 = 169\), as this aligns with the evaluation of \(\Phi_{13}(1)\) and the structure of the expression. Therefore, the remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is 169.

proposed answer: To find the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, we need to analyze the expression where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). This is because \( \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2 \), and thus the expression simplifies to a real number. The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1) \) involves evaluating each term for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \). The symmetry and properties of roots of unity suggest that the product simplifies to an integer. The key insight is that the product of all non-trivial 13th roots of unity is \( -1 \), as the product of all 13th roots of unity is 1 and \( \omega^0 = 1 \) is excluded. However, the expression \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \) is real and positive for each \( k \), and the symmetry in the roots of unity leads to a balanced product. The consistent answer from multiple agents is that the product simplifies to 1, as seen in the sanity check for 5th roots of unity where the product also simplifies to 1. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 1.
