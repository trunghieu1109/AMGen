Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_7_19
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) equals 409. The question now is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. Since 409 is less than 1000, the remainder when 409 is divided by 1000 is simply 409 itself. There is no need for further reduction or modular arithmetic because the product is already an integer less than 1000. This confirms that the remainder is 409.

is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: We have the integer product from the previous sub-task as 8321. The task is to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. To do this, we use modular arithmetic: 8321 mod 1000 is the remainder after dividing 8321 by 1000. Since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, the remainder is 321. This is a straightforward modular reduction. To verify correctness, we note that modular arithmetic properties ensure that (a * b) mod m = [(a mod m) * (b mod m)] mod m, and since 8321 is the product of two conjugates, the integer nature is confirmed, and reducing modulo 1000 is valid. There is no ambiguity or complexity in this step, so the remainder is confidently 321.
