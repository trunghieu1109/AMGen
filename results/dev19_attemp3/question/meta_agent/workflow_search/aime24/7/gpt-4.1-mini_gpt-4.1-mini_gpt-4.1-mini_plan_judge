Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we have explicit approximate values for x and y as x ≈ 1.54 and y ≈ 16.23. However, the problem and the previous reasoning show that y = 25 / x exactly. Therefore, the product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25 exactly. This is consistent with the original logarithmic equations and the constraints that both x and y are greater than 1. The approximate values given are numerical approximations to satisfy the equations, but the exact product xy is 25. Hence, the product xy is 25.
