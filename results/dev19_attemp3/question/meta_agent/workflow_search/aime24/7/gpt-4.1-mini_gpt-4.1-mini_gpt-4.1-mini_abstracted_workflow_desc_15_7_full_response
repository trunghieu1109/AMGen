These two exponential equations directly correspond to the given logarithmic equations and express the relationship between x and y in terms of powers.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation gives two linear equations in terms of ln(x) and ln(y): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y) and 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x). From the first equation, we isolate ln(y) as ln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x. Substituting this expression into the second equation yields 10 * (10 ln(x) / x) = 4y ln(x), which simplifies to (100 ln(x)) / x = 4y ln(x). Since x > 1, ln(x) > 0, so we can divide both sides by ln(x) to get 100 / x = 4y. Rearranging this gives y = 25 / x. This explicit relation y = 25 / x is consistent with the original exponential relations and is derived through clear algebraic manipulation and logarithmic properties. It expresses y directly in terms of x, linking the two variables explicitly and simplifying the problem to a single variable.

Substituting y = 25 / x into the first equation gives x^{10} = (25 / x)^x = 25^x / x^x, which rearranges to x^{10 + x} = 25^x. Taking natural logarithms yields (10 + x) ln x = x ln 25.

Simplifying, we get (100 ln(x)) / x = 4y ln(x). Assuming ln(x) ≠ 0 (since x > 1 and thus ln(x) > 0), we can divide both sides by ln(x) to get 100 / x = 4y. Rearranging, y = 100 / (4x) = 25 / x.

For the first equation: ln(x^{10}) = ln(y^x) => 10 ln(x) = x ln(y). For the second equation: ln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y}) => 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x).

Substitute this into the second equation: 10 * (10 ln(x) / x) = 4y ln(x). Simplify: (100 ln(x)) / x = 4y ln(x). Since x > 1 and y > 1, ln(x) > 0, so we can divide both sides by ln(x): 100 / x = 4y.

Since y = 25 / x, for y > 1, we must have 25 / x > 1, which implies x < 25. Combining this with x > 1, we get 1 < x < 25. Next, recall the original equations transformed into exponential form: x^{10} = y^x and y^{10} = x^{4y}. Using y = 25 / x, substitute into the first equation: x^{10} = (25 / x)^x = 25^x / x^x. Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10} * x^x = 25^x, or x^{10 + x} = 25^x. Taking natural logarithms: (10 + x) ln x = x ln 25. Rearranged, this gives (10 + x) ln x / x = ln 25. Define a function f(x) = (10 + x) (ln x) / x. We want to find x in (1,25) such that f(x) = ln 25. Since ln 25 = ln(5^2) = 2 ln 5 ≈ 3.2189, we check values: at x=5, f(5) = (10+5)(ln 5)/5 = 15 * ln 5 / 5 = 3 * ln 5 ≈ 3 * 1.6094 = 4.828, which is greater than 3.2189. At x=2, f(2) = 12 * ln 2 / 2 = 6 * ln 2 ≈ 6 * 0.6931 = 4.158, still greater than 3.2189. At x=1.5, f(1.5) = 11.5 * ln 1.5 / 1.5 ≈ 11.5 * 0.4055 / 1.5 ≈ 3.11, slightly less than 3.2189. So f(x) decreases near 1.5 and increases near 2, suggesting the root is near 1.55. Using numerical methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson or bisection), we find x ≈ 1.56. Then y = 25 / x ≈ 16.03, which satisfies y > 1. Finally, verify the second original equation y^{10} = x^{4y} with these values to check consistency. The approximate numerical check confirms the solution is consistent. Therefore, explicit approximate values for (x, y) satisfying both equations and constraints are x ≈ 1.56 and y ≈ 16.03, with the exact relation y = 25 / x.

Now, recall the original equations transformed into exponential forms: x^{10} = y^x and y^{10} = x^{4y}. Substituting y = 25 / x into the first equation: x^{10} = (25 / x)^x. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: 10 ln(x) = x ln(25 / x) = x (ln 25 - ln x) = x ln 25 - x ln x. Rearranging: 10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25, or ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25. Define f(x) = ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25. We want f(x) = 0 with 1 < x < 25.

Since y = 25 / x, for y > 1, it follows that 25 / x > 1, or equivalently, x < 25. Combining both constraints, we have 1 < x < 25. Now, recall from the original problem that log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the exponential form: x^{10} = y^x and y^{10} = x^{4y}. Substituting y = 25 / x into the first equation gives x^{10} = (25 / x)^x = 25^x / x^x. Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10} * x^x = 25^x, or x^{10 + x} = 25^x. Taking natural logarithms: (10 + x) ln x = x ln 25. Rearranged: (10 + x) ln x = x ln 25. This is a transcendental equation in x, which can be solved numerically. Checking for x near 5: ln 5 ≈ 1.609, ln 25 ≈ 3.219. Left side: (10 + 5) * 1.609 = 15 * 1.609 = 24.135. Right side: 5 * 3.219 = 16.095. Left side > right side.
