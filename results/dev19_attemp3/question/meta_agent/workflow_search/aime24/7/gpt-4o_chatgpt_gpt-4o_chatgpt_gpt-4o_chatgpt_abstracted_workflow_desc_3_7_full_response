We aim to express x and y in terms of each other or a common parameter. From equation 1, we have x log(y) = 10 log(x), which implies log(y) = (10/x) log(x). Similarly, from equation 2, we have 4y log(x) = 10 log(y), which implies log(x) = (10/4y) log(y). Now, substitute log(y) = (10/x) log(x) from the first equation into the second equation: log(x) = (10/4y) ((10/x) log(x)). Simplifying, we get log(x) = (100/4xy) log(x). Assuming log(x) is not zero (since x > 1), we can divide both sides by log(x) to get 1 = 100/4xy. Simplifying gives 4xy = 100, so xy = 25. Thus, x and y are related by the equation xy = 25.

We need to express x and y in terms of each other or a common parameter. Let's start with the first equation: x log(y) = 10 log(x). Divide both sides by log(y) log(x) to get x / log(x) = 10 / log(y). This implies log(y) = 10 log(x) / x. For the second equation, 4y log(x) = 10 log(y). Divide both sides by log(x) log(y) to get 4y / log(y) = 10 / log(x). This implies log(x) = 4y log(y) / 10. Now, we have two expressions: log(y) = 10 log(x) / x and log(x) = 4y log(y) / 10. Substitute log(y) from the first expression into the second: log(x) = 4y (10 log(x) / x) / 10. Simplify this to get log(x) = (4y log(x)) / x. Cancel log(x) from both sides (assuming log(x) is not zero), we get 1 = 4y / x. Therefore, x = 4y. Now, substitute x = 4y into log(y) = 10 log(x) / x: log(y) = 10 log(4y) / (4y). This gives us a relationship between x and y.
