Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_7
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined the values of x and y as x = 10 and y = 5/2. To find the product xy, we simply multiply these two values together. Since x = 10 and y = 5/2, the product xy is calculated as 10 * (5/2). This simplifies to 10 * 5 / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25. Therefore, the product xy is 25.
