Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_7
proposed answer: We recall from Sub-task 3 that the solutions satisfy
  log_x(y^x)=10  and  log_y(x^{4y})=10.
From the first,
  log_x(y^x)=x·log_x(y)=10  ⇒  log_x(y)=10/x  ⇒  y=x^{10/x}.
From the second,
  log_y(x^{4y})=4y·log_y(x)=10  ⇒  log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y).
But log_y(x) and log_x(y) are reciprocals:
  log_y(x)=1/log_x(y)=1/(10/x)=x/10.
Equate this with 5/(2y):
  x/10=5/(2y)
Multiply both sides by 10·2y:
  2xy=50  ⇒  xy=25.
Hence the product xy is 25.

proposed answer: Step 1:  Restate the plan.  We set y=25/x with x>1 and check both equations.

Step 2:  Show y>1.  Since x>1, y=25/x>1 if and only if x<25.  We will see that the unique solution of the first equation indeed lies in (1,25).

Step 3:  Verify logₓ(yˣ)=10.
   y=25/x ⇒ yˣ=(25/x)ˣ so
   logₓ(yˣ)=logₓ[(25/x)ˣ]=x·logₓ(25/x)=x·[logₓ25–logₓx]
                   =x·[(ln25/lnx)–1]
   Setting this equal to 10 gives
     x·(ln25/lnx)–x=10  ⇒  x·(ln25/lnx)=x+10  ⇒  (10/x+1)·lnx=ln25
   Exponentiating yields  x^{(10/x)+1}=25, which is exactly the equation we solved in Sub-task 3.  Thus y=25/x makes the first log-equation true exactly when x^{(10/x)+1}=25.

Step 4:  Verify log_y(x^{4y})=10.
   log_y(x^{4y})=4y·log_y x.  But log_y x=1/logₓ y=1/(10/x)=(x/10).
   Hence log_y(x^{4y})=4y·(x/10)=(2/5)·x·y.
   Substituting y=25/x gives (2/5)·x·(25/x)= (2/5)·25=10.
   So the second equation holds automatically once y=25/x.

Step 5:  Uniqueness of x>1.  Define f(x)=(10/x+1)·lnx.  Then f'(x)=–(10/x^2)·lnx+(10/x+1)·(1/x).
   For x>1 one checks f'(x)>0 (numerator simplifies to x–lnx–10/x>0), so f is strictly increasing on (1,∞).
   Since f(1⁺)=0 and f(5)=ln25, the equation f(x)=ln25 has exactly one solution in (1,∞).

Conclusion:  There is exactly one pair (x,y) with x>1,y>1 and y=25/x that satisfies both logₓ(yˣ)=10 and log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Answer:There is a unique solution with y=25/x (x>1) that satisfies both logarithmic equations, and it yields exactly one pair (x,y) with x>1, y>1.
