Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The problem is to find the number of monotone lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Such a path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U), arranged in exactly 5 segments alternating between R and U moves. There are two possible alternating patterns for these 5 segments: R-U-R-U-R and U-R-U-R-U. Each segment length is a positive integer, and the sum of the right segments must be 8, and the sum of the up segments must be 8. For the pattern R-U-R-U-R, the right segments are 3 in number and must sum to 8, and the up segments are 2 in number and must sum to 8. The number of positive integer compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2) = 21, and into 2 parts is C(7,1) = 7. Therefore, the total number of valid segment length combinations for this pattern is 21 * 7 = 147. Similarly, for the pattern U-R-U-R-U, the up segments are 3 in number summing to 8, and the right segments are 2 in number summing to 8, giving again 21 * 7 = 147 valid combinations. Since these two patterns are mutually exclusive and cover all possible 5-segment paths with exactly four direction changes, the total number of such paths is the sum of the two: 147 + 147 = 294. Each unique segment length combination corresponds to exactly one path because the path is uniquely determined by the sequence of moves and their lengths. This reasoning is consistent across multiple agents and is mathematically sound, relying on counting compositions and the structure of the path. Hence, the most consistent and correct total count of paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
