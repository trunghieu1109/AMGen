Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We need to find the total number of length-16 paths on the 8×8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times. The problem is divided into two starting‐direction cases:

1. Paths that start by moving East.  (Sub-task 2)  
   • Given result: 147 paths

2. Paths that start by moving North. (Sub-task 3)  
   • Given result: 147 paths

Since these two sets of paths are disjoint (a path cannot start both East and North), the total number of such paths is the sum of the two counts:

Total = (Number starting East) + (Number starting North)
Total = 147 + 147
Total = 294

Answer:294
