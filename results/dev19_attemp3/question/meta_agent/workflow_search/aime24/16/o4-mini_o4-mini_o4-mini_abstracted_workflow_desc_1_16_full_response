Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent dfzh', content='We use the standard relation for a triangle: AB·AC = (2·r·s)/sinA, where r is the inradius, s the semiperimeter, and A the angle at A. From prior sub-tasks we have: 1) r = 6, 2) s = 6√30, 3) sinA = 2√30/13. Step 1: Compute the numerator 2·r·s = 2·6·(6√30) = 72√30. Step 2: Write the denominator sinA = 2√30/13; its reciprocal is 13/(2√30). Step 3: Multiply: 72√30 × (13/(2√30)) = (72/2)·13·(√30/√30) = 36·13·1 = 468. Since r > 0, s > 0, and sinA > 0 for an interior triangle angle A, there is no sign ambiguity.

We need to compute AB·AC=2·r·s/sinA.\n\nStep 1: Compute the numerator 2·r·s:\n  2·6·(6√30)=12·6√30=72√30.\n\nStep 2: Divide by sinA:\n  AB·AC=(72√30)/(2√30/13)=72√30·(13/(2√30)).\n\nStep 3: Simplify:\n  √30 cancels, giving 72·13/2=36·13=468.\n\nCase analysis: Since A is an interior angle of a triangle, A∈(0,π), so sinA>0 and no sign ambiguity arises. Thus the product AB·AC is 468.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ivRQ:\nWe are to compute AB·AC using the formula AB·AC = (2·r·s)/sin A.
