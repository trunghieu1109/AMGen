Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_16
proposed answer: We use the standard relation for a triangle: AB·AC = (2·r·s)/sinA, where r is the inradius, s the semiperimeter, and A the angle at A. From prior sub-tasks we have: 1) r = 6, 2) s = 6√30, 3) sinA = 2√30/13. Step 1: Compute the numerator 2·r·s = 2·6·(6√30) = 72√30. Step 2: Write the denominator sinA = 2√30/13; its reciprocal is 13/(2√30). Step 3: Multiply: 72√30 × (13/(2√30)) = (72/2)·13·(√30/√30) = 36·13·1 = 468. Since r > 0, s > 0, and sinA > 0 for an interior triangle angle A, there is no sign ambiguity. Thus the unique consistent value of AB·AC is 468.
