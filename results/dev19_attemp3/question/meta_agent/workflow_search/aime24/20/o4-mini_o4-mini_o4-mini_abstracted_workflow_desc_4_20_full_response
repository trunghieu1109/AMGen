Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hLAB', content='We seek the least b≥2 for which the count f(b) of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.  From Sub-task 3, for fixed b, letting d=b–1, one checks k∈{2,…,d} and counts those satisfying d∣k(k–1); each such k gives a valid two-digit base-b number n=k².  Write d=∏_{i=1}^r p_i^{e_i}.  The condition d∣k(k–1) is equivalent to k≡0 or 1 mod p_i^{e_i} for each prime power factor.  By the Chinese remainder theorem there are exactly 2^r residue classes mod d satisfying all these, and among these classes only the one with k≡1 mod d falls outside our k-range (it yields k=1), while each of the remaining 2^r–1 classes produces exactly one k in {2,…,d}.  Hence f(b)=2^r–1.  We need f(b)>10 ⇒2^r–1>10 ⇒2^r>11 ⇒r≥4.  The smallest d with four distinct prime divisors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=d+1=211.  For all b<211 we have at most 3 b-eautiful numbers, and at b=211 we get f(211)=2^4–1=15>10.

Rearranging yields k² − k = d₁·(b−1), i.e.\n      (b−1)·d₁ = k(k−1).\n5. Hence d₁ = k(k−1)/(b−1) and d₀ = k − d₁, which must both be integers in their respective digit‐ranges.\n6. The requirement 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 gives\n      (b−1) ≤ k(k−1) ≤ (b−1)².\n7. The requirement 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1 gives\n      0 ≤ k − d₁ ≤ b−1 ⇒ k ≤ b.\n8. Finally, d₁ ≥ 1 forces k ≥ 2.\n\nThus the complete Diophantine characterization is: d₁ = k(k−1)/(b−1), d₀ = k−d₁, with k ∈ ℕ satisfying 2 ≤ k ≤ b and (b−1) divides k(k−1).; answer: We isolate d₁ and d₀ as\n  d₁ = k(k−1)/(b−1),\n  d₀ = k − d₁,\nand the necessary and sufficient constraints on k are\n  k ∈ ℕ,    2 ≤ k ≤ b,\n  (b−1) | k(k−1).\nEquivalently, (b−1)d₁ = k(k−1) with 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1, which is fully equivalent to the bounds (b−1) ≤ k(k−1) ≤ (b−1)² and k ≤ b.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent TZfp, thinking: We start with the two defining equations for a b-eautiful number n with digits d₁,d₀ (in base b) and k=√n:\n 1) n = d₁·b + d₀,\n 2) d₁ + d₀ = k,\nwith digit bounds 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b–1, 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b–1, and k∈ℕ.  \n\nStep 1: Substitute d₀ = k–d₁ from (2) into (1):\n   k² = d₁·b + (k–d₁) = d₁·(b–1) + k.\nRearrange:\n   k² – k = d₁·(b–1)\nso\n   (b–1)·d₁ = k(k–1).\n\nStep 2: Solve for d₁ and d₀ in terms of k,b:\n   d₁ = k(k–1)/(b–1),\n   d₀ = k – d₁ = k – k(k–1)/(b–1).\n\nStep 3: Impose digit bounds to derive bounds on k.\n • From d₁ ≥ 1  ⇒  k(k–1)/(b–1) ≥ 1  ⇒  k(k–1) ≥ b–1.  (i)\n • From d₁ ≤ b–1 ⇒  k(k–1)/(b–1) ≤ b–1 ⇒ k(k–1) ≤ (b–1)².  (ii)\n • From d₀ ≥ 0  ⇒  k – k(k–1)/(b–1) ≥ 0 ⇒ k[(b–1) – (k–1)] ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ b.  (iii)\n • From d₀ ≤ b–1 ⇒  k – k(k–1)/(b–1) ≤ b–1 ⇒ k(b–k) ≤ (b–1)², which is weaker than k ≤ b in practice.  \n\nCombining (i),(ii),(iii) gives\n   2 ≤ k ≤ b,\n   k(k–1) divisible by (b–1),\n   and b–1 ≤ k(k–1) ≤ (b–1)².\n\nThus every b-eautiful number corresponds to an integer k in [2,b] satisfying (b–1)|k(k–1), with digits d₁,d₀ as above.; answer: For a b-beautiful integer n, set k=√n. Then\nd₁ = k(k–1)/(b–1),\nd₀ = k – d₁,\nand the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n • k is an integer with 2 ≤ k ≤ b,\n • (b–1) divides k(k–1),\n • d₁ and d₀ as given lie in the digit ranges 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b–1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b–1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent A0sp, thinking: We want to count, for a fixed base b≥2, all positive integers n that are b-eautiful.  From Sub-tasks 1 and 2 we know: n has exactly two base-b digits d₁,d₀ with 1≤d₁≤b−1, 0≤d₀≤b−1, √n=k∈ℕ and d₁+d₀=k.  Eliminating d₀ gives k²−k=d₁(b−1), so equivalently\n\n  (b−1)  divides  k(k−1),   and   2≤k≤b\n\nand then d₁=k(k−1)/(b−1), d₀=k−d₁ automatically lie in the correct digit ranges when k is in [2,b] and the divisibility holds.  \n\nTherefore the precise counting procedure is:\n1.  Initialize count←0.  \n2.  For each integer k from 2 up to b:\n     a.  Compute M= k·(k−1).\n     b.  Test if M mod (b−1)=0.  If not, skip to the next k.\n     c.  Otherwise set d₁= M/(b−1), d₀= k−d₁.  \n     d.  Because 2≤k≤b and (b−1)|M one can verify 1≤d₁≤b−1 and 0≤d₀≤b−1 automatically, so each such k produces exactly one b-beautiful n=k².\n     e.  Increment count by 1.\n3.  Return count, the total number of b-beautiful integers in base b.\n\nPotential pitfalls addressed:\n •  One must loop through all k in [2,b] because when b−1 is composite, k(k−1)≡0 mod(b−1) can happen for many k’s, not just k≡0 or 1 mod(b−1).\n •  Digit-bounds on d₁,d₀ are enforced by the range 2≤k≤b once divisibility holds, so no further checks are needed.\n •  Omitting either the divisibility test or the bound on k would overcount or undercount.\n\nThis simple two-step check (range+divisibility) is both necessary and sufficient to count all b-eautiful numbers for any fixed b.; answer: To count the number of b-beautiful integers for a fixed b≥2:\n\n1. Set count = 0.\n2. For k from 2 to b do:\n   • If (k*(k−1)) mod (b−1) = 0 then:\n       – Compute d₁ = k*(k−1)/(b−1), d₀ = k−d₁.\n       – (These automatically satisfy 1≤d₁≤b−1 and 0≤d₀≤b−1.)\n       – Increment count by 1.\n3. Return count.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent bk4y, feedback: The proposed procedure omits necessary digit‐range checks and uses an incorrect upper bound on k. In fact, while (b−1)∣k(k−1) is required, one must also enforce 1≤d₁=M/(b−1)≤b−1 and 0≤d₀=k−d₁≤b−1. Taking k up to b allows M/(b−1)=b, which violates d₁≤b−1 (e.g. for k=b we get d₁=b). Similarly, n=k² must lie between b and b²−1, forcing k≤b−1 and k≥⌈√b⌉, not 2≤k≤b. Without these extra bounds the count overestimates b-beautiful numbers. Hence the solution as stated is incomplete.; correct: False\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent A0sp, thinking: We need a robust count of all b-beautiful numbers n in base b.  From Sub-tasks 1&2 we know n=k² where its two base-b digits (d₁,d₀) satisfy\n  d₁+b·0 +d₀ = k²,\n  d₁+d₀ = k,\nwhich reduces to\n  k(k−1) = d₁·(b−1),\nwith digit bounds\n  1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1,\n  0 ≤ d₀ = k−d₁ ≤ b−1,\nand exactly two base-b digits (i.e. b ≤ n ≤ b²−1 ⇒ k² ≥ b and k² ≤ b²−1 ⇒ k ≤ b−1).\n\nCommon pitfalls in earlier attempts:\n •  Omitting explicit checks on d₁ ≤ b−1 and d₀ ≤ b−1.  Without these, k=b gives d₁=b which is invalid.  \n •  Using k≤b instead of k≤b−1; although k=b is skipped by digit checks, it’s cleaner to restrict k≤b−1.\n •  Forgetting that n≥b requires k²≥b, but enforcing d₁≥1 already forces k≥2⇒k²≥b for all b≥2.\n\nThus the correct counting procedure is:\n 1.

Check digit bounds: if 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1, then this k yields a valid two-digit base-b number n=k²; increment count.\n 3. Return count.; answer: To count b-beautiful numbers for a fixed integer b≥2:\n\n1. Set count = 0.\n2. For k from 2 to (b−1) do:\n   • Let M = k*(k−1).\n   • If M mod (b−1) ≠ 0, continue to next k.\n   • Else compute d₁ = M/(b−1) and d₀ = k − d₁.\n   • If 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1, increment count by 1.\n3. Return count.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent hLAB, thinking: We seek the least b≥2 for which the count f(b) of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.  From Sub-task 3, for fixed b, letting d=b–1, one checks k∈{2,…,d} and counts those satisfying d∣k(k–1); each such k gives a valid two-digit base-b number n=k².  Write d=∏_{i=1}^r p_i^{e_i}.  The condition d∣k(k–1) is equivalent to k≡0 or 1 mod p_i^{e_i} for each prime power factor.  By the Chinese remainder theorem there are exactly 2^r residue classes mod d satisfying all these, and among these classes only the one with k≡1 mod d falls outside our k-range (it yields k=1), while each of the remaining 2^r–1 classes produces exactly one k in {2,…,d}.  Hence f(b)=2^r–1.  We need f(b)>10 ⇒2^r–1>10 ⇒2^r>11 ⇒r≥4.  The smallest d with four distinct prime divisors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=d+1=211.  For all b<211 we have at most 3 b-eautiful numbers, and at b=211 we get f(211)=2^4–1=15>10.  Therefore the least b is 211.; answer: 211', iteration_idx=-1)]
