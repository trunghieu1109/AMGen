Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We seek the least b≥2 for which the count f(b) of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.  From Sub-task 3, for fixed b, letting d=b–1, one checks k∈{2,…,d} and counts those satisfying d∣k(k–1); each such k gives a valid two-digit base-b number n=k².  Write d=∏_{i=1}^r p_i^{e_i}.  The condition d∣k(k–1) is equivalent to k≡0 or 1 mod p_i^{e_i} for each prime power factor.  By the Chinese remainder theorem there are exactly 2^r residue classes mod d satisfying all these, and among these classes only the one with k≡1 mod d falls outside our k-range (it yields k=1), while each of the remaining 2^r–1 classes produces exactly one k in {2,…,d}.  Hence f(b)=2^r–1.  We need f(b)>10 ⇒2^r–1>10 ⇒2^r>11 ⇒r≥4.  The smallest d with four distinct prime divisors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=d+1=211.  For all b<211 we have at most 3 b-eautiful numbers, and at b=211 we get f(211)=2^4–1=15>10.  Therefore the least b is 211.
