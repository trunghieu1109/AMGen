Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent afuC', content="To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to carefully analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A b-beautiful integer n is defined as a two-digit number in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b. The conditions are: 1 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b, and a + c = sqrt(n). Additionally, n must be a perfect square and satisfy b <= n < b^2. We need to iterate over possible values of a and c for each base b, calculate n = ab + c, check if n is a perfect square, and verify if a + c = sqrt(n). We count the number of such numbers for each base b. Starting from b = 2, we increment b until we find a base where the count exceeds ten. The key is to ensure that all conditions are correctly applied, especially that n is a perfect square and that the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n). After performing these calculations, we find that the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is b = 14.

A number n is b-beautiful if it can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b, meaning 0 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. The sum of these digits, a + c, must equal the square root of n, i.e., a + c = sqrt(n). Additionally, n must be a perfect square and satisfy b <= n < b^2. We will iterate over possible values of a and c for each base b, compute n = ab + c, check if n is a perfect square, and verify if a + c = sqrt(n). We will count the number of such numbers for each base b and find the smallest b for which the count exceeds ten. We start with b = 2 and increment b until we find the desired count.

We keep a count of such numbers for each base b. The potential pitfalls include ensuring that n is correctly calculated as a two-digit number in base b, verifying that n is a perfect square, and accurately checking the condition a + c = sqrt(n).

A b-beautiful integer n is defined as a two-digit number in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b. The conditions are: 1 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b, and a + c = sqrt(n). Additionally, n must be a perfect square and satisfy b <= n < b^2. We need to iterate over possible values of a and c for each base b, calculate n = ab + c, check if n is a perfect square, and verify if a + c = sqrt(n). We count the number of such numbers for each base b. Starting from b = 2, we increment b until we find a base where the count exceeds ten. The key is to ensure that all conditions are correctly applied, especially that n is a perfect square and that the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n). After performing these calculations, we find that the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is b = 14. This conclusion is supported by multiple agents' calculations, and it is consistent with the conditions outlined for b-beautiful integers.; answer: 14", iteration_idx=-1)]
