Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We need the radius r of the smallest sphere containing any box with surface area 54 and volume 23.  Equivalently, if the box has edges a,b,c>0, its circumscribed sphere has radius r = ½√(a²+b²+c²).  We seek the maximum of S = a²+b²+c² under the constraints:
  (1) ab+bc+ca = 27     (since surface area 2(ab+bc+ca)=54)
  (2) abc = 23          (given volume)
and then compute r² = S/4.

By symmetry, the maximum of S for positive a,b,c under these symmetric constraints occurs when two of the variables are equal.  Set a = b = x and c = y.  Then:
  (i)  x² + 2xy = 27
  (ii) x²y = 23  ⇒  y = 23/x².
Substitute y into (i):
  x² + 2x·(23/x²) = 27
  x² + 46/x = 27
Multiply both sides by x to clear denominator:
  x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.
Test small integer roots: x = 2 gives 8 - 54 + 46 = 0, so x = 2 is a root.  Factor the cubic:
  (x - 2)(x² + 2x - 23) = 0.
The quadratic factor has roots x = -1 ± √(1 + 23) = -1 ± 2√6.  The positive roots are x = 2 and x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.898.

For each positive x we compute y=23/x² and then S = 2x² + y²:
 • If x = 2, then y = 23/4 = 5.75, so S = 2·(2²) + (5.75)² = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16.
 • If x = -1 + 2√6, then x² ≈ 15.197, y ≈ 23/15.197 ≈ 1.513, so S ≈ 2·15.197 + (1.513)² ≈ 32.684, which is smaller.
Thus the maximum S is 657/16, achieved at x=2, y=23/4.

Therefore r² = S/4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.  This fraction is in lowest terms (gcd(657,64)=1), so p = 657 and q = 64.  Hence p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
