Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the sum of the numerator and denominator of a fraction that represents the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. From the related sub-task, we have already determined that the square of the radius, r^2, is expressed as the fraction 169/36. The integers 169 and 36 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, p = 169 and q = 36. The task is to calculate p + q, which is simply the sum of these two integers.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. The box has dimensions a, b, and c, satisfying the equations 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 and abc = 23. The space diagonal of the box is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2), and the radius of the sphere is half of this diagonal, so r = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) / 2. Therefore, r^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) / 4. The task is to express r^2 as a fraction p/q where p and q are relatively prime, and then find p + q. From the synthesis of previous sub-tasks, the solution that maximizes a^2 + b^2 + c^2 leads to r^2 = 205/4. Here, p = 205 and q = 4, which are relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 209. This conclusion is consistent with the reasoning provided by the agents wKPL and h9WO, who both arrived at the same result.
