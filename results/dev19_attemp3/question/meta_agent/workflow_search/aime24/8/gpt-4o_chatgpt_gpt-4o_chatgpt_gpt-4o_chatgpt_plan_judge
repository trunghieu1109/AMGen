Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice, which are the winning positions for Bob. From the analysis provided, the key pattern is that n is a losing position for Alice if n % 3 == 2. This means when n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, Bob can always win. The sequence of such numbers is an arithmetic sequence starting from 2, with a common difference of 3: 2, 5, 8, ..., up to the largest n ≤ 2024. The general term of this sequence is a_k = 3k - 1. To find the largest k such that 3k - 1 ≤ 2024, we solve 3k - 1 = 2024, which simplifies to 3k = 2025, giving k = 675. Thus, there are 675 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, as these numbers are all of the form 3k + 2, making them losing positions for Alice.

proposed answer: To determine the most consistent and correct solution for the number of winning strategies for Bob, we need to analyze the given answers and the reasoning behind them. The problem involves determining the losing positions for Alice, which are winning for Bob, using a dynamic programming approach. The base cases and recurrence relation are provided: dp[1] = True, dp[2] = False, dp[3] = False, dp[4] = True, dp[5] = False, and dp[n] = True if (dp[n-1] == False or (n >= 4 and dp[n-4] == False)), otherwise dp[n] = False. A position n is losing for Alice if dp[n] = False. The answers provided are 1012 and 810. The reasoning for 1012 is based on iterating the recurrence relation up to n = 2024 and counting the number of positions where dp[n] = False. This approach is consistent with the dynamic programming method and the periodic pattern of losing positions. The answer 810 is based on a pattern of losing positions occurring every 5 numbers, specifically n ≡ 2, 3 (mod 5). However, the dynamic programming approach directly counting the losing positions up to 2024 is more reliable and consistent with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the most consistent and correct solution is 1012.
