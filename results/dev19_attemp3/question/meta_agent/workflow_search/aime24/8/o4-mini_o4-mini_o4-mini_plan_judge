Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: We know from Sub-task 2 and the DP verification that the P-positions are exactly those n with n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).

1. Count n≡0 (mod 5): these are n=5k for integer k≥1. The largest k satisfies 5k≤2024 ⇒ k≤⌊2024/5⌋=404. Thus there are 404 such n.

2. Count n≡2 (mod 5): these are n=5k+2 for integer k≥0. The largest k satisfies 5k+2≤2024 ⇒ k≤⌊(2024−2)/5⌋=⌊2022/5⌋=404. Since k runs from 0 to 404 inclusive, there are 405 such n.

3. Total P-positions ≤2024 = 404+405 = 809. This equals the number of n ≤2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
