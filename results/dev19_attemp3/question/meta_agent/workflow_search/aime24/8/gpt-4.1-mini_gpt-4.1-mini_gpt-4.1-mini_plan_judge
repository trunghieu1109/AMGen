Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we determined that Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy if and only if the initial number of tokens n satisfies n mod 5 = 1. This is because after Alice's first move (removing either 1 or 4 tokens), the resulting position must be a losing position for Alice, which occurs when both n-1 and n-4 are losing positions. The losing positions are those where the number of tokens is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. By analyzing the modular conditions, the only consistent residue class for n is 1 modulo 5. To count how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 1, we find the smallest such number is 1 and the largest is 2021 (since 2021 mod 5 = 1). The count is given by ((2021 - 1) / 5) + 1 = (2020 / 5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405. Therefore, there are 405 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The game involves two players alternately removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens, with Alice moving first. The goal is to find all positions n ≤ 2024 from which Bob (the second player) has a guaranteed winning strategy, i.e., all P-positions. A P-position is defined as a position where the player to move will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Starting from the base case n=0 (a P-position since no moves are possible), we analyze the positions for small n and find a repeating pattern every 5 tokens. Specifically, P-positions occur exactly when n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. This is because from these positions, any move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to positions with n mod 5 = 4 or 1 (if n mod 5=0), or n mod 5 = 1 or 3 (if n mod 5=2), all of which are N-positions. Conversely, from any N-position, there is at least one move to a P-position. This modular pattern holds for all positive integers up to 2024 due to the periodicity of moves and positions. Since Alice moves first, if the initial position n is a P-position, Alice is in a losing position, and Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. To find the count of such n ≤ 2024, note that in every block of 5 consecutive integers, exactly two integers satisfy n mod 5 ∈ {0, 2}. There are 404 full blocks of 5 in 2024 (since 2024 // 5 = 404) contributing 2 × 404 = 808 such numbers. The remainder is 4 numbers (2021 to 2024). Among these, only 2022 ≡ 2 mod 5 qualifies, adding 1 more. Thus, the total count is 808 + 1 = 809. To verify, sampling several such n (e.g., n=2, 5, 10, 12) confirms that from each, every possible move leads to an N-position, ensuring Bob's winning strategy is valid. Therefore, the total number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is 809.
