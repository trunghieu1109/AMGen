Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: We are tasked with finding the total number of ordered triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying both the linear sum constraint a + b + c = 300 and the cubic polynomial equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The key insight is to rewrite the polynomial sum in terms of symmetric sums: s1 = a+b+c, s2 = ab+bc+ca, and s3 = abc. The polynomial sum can be expressed as s1*s2 - 3*s3. Given s1=300, the equation becomes 6,000,000 = 300*s2 - 3*s3, or equivalently 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000. Since a,b,c are nonnegative integers, s3 = abc ≥ 0, implying s2 ≥ 20,000. The maximum s2 occurs when a=b=c=100, yielding s2=30,000 and s3=1,000,000. Substituting these values satisfies the equation exactly: 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. For any other triple, either s3 would be negative or the polynomial would not have integer roots, which is impossible since a,b,c are nonnegative integers. Therefore, the only triple satisfying both conditions is (100,100,100). Since all permutations of (100,100,100) are identical, there is only one ordered triple solution. Hence, the total number of ordered triples (a,b,c) satisfying both constraints is 1.

proposed answer: We are given the problem of finding the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The key insight is to rewrite the second equation using the symmetric identity: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc. Substituting a+b+c=300, we get 300*(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100*(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Let s2 = ab+bc+ca and s3 = abc, then 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000. The roots a,b,c satisfy the cubic polynomial x^3 - 300x^2 + s2 x - s3 = 0. We look for integer triples (a,b,c) with sum 300 and satisfying the above relation. Two candidate pairs (s2,s3) emerge: (20,000, 0) and (30,000, 1,000,000). For (20,000, 0), the polynomial factors as x(x^2 - 300x + 20,000). The quadratic has discriminant 10,000, roots 100 and 200, all integers. So the roots are 0, 100, 200, summing to 300 and satisfying the polynomial. The ordered triples formed by permutations of (0, 100, 200) are 6 in total. For (30,000, 1,000,000), the polynomial has one integer root 100, but the quadratic factor has no integer roots, so no integer triple solutions arise. Thus, the only solutions are the 6 permutations of (0, 100, 200). This counting includes all ordered triples, no duplicates missed, and boundary cases (zero included). Therefore, the total number of ordered triples (a,b,c) satisfying both conditions is 6.
