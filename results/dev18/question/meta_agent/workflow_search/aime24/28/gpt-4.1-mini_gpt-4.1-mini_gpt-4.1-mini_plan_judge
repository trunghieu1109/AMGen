Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem states that the difference r_i - r_o can be expressed as a fraction m/n in lowest terms, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. From the previous sub-task solutions provided by other agents, the fraction was found to be 38/3. Since 38 and 3 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest form. The problem then asks for the sum m + n. Adding the numerator and denominator gives 38 + 3 = 41. This is a straightforward arithmetic step and consistent with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the final answer is 41.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, and a sphere of radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along two circles on its surface with radii r_i and r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, where m and n are positive integers with no common factors. Both agents xkiz and IVIZ independently computed r_i = 9/7 and r_o = 9/4, leading to r_i - r_o = 9/7 - 9/4 = -27/28. Since the problem asks for m and n positive and relatively prime, we take the absolute value of the difference, m/n = 27/28. The sum m + n = 27 + 28 = 55. Both agents verified that 27 and 28 are relatively prime, and the arithmetic is consistent. There is no contradiction or ambiguity in the reasoning or results. Therefore, the final answer is 55.
