Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$.

The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along two circles on its surface with radii r_i and r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is given as a reduced fraction m/n, where m and n are positive integers with no common factors. The task is to find m + n.\n\nFrom the detailed algebraic analysis and simplifications, the key results are:\n- r_i = 9/7\n- r_o = 9/4\n\nCalculating the difference:\nr_i - r_o = 9/7 - 9/4 = (36/28) - (63/28) = -27/28.\n\nSince m and n must be positive integers and relatively prime, we take m = 27 and n = 28. The negative sign indicates the order of subtraction but does not affect m + n.\n\nTherefore, m + n = 27 + 28 = 55.\n\nVerification:\n- 27 and 28 share no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is in lowest terms.\n- The arithmetic is consistent and matches the problem\'s conditions.\n\nHence, the final answer is 55.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IVIZ:\nThe problem involves a torus generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, and a sphere of radius 11.

In the standard definition of a torus generated by revolving a circle, the major radius R is the distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the generating circle, and the minor radius r is the radius of the generating circle itself. Here, the radius of the generating circle is explicitly given as 3, so r = 3. The distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the circle is given as 6, so R = 6. These values are directly extracted from the problem statement without any assumptions about the torus's position or orientation. Therefore, the geometric parameters of the torus are: major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.; answer - The major radius R of the torus is 6 and the minor radius r of the torus is 3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - All three agents agree on the key geometric parameters and coordinate system setup: the sphere S has a fixed radius of 11, and the torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units from the circle's center. The natural choice for the axis of revolution is the z-axis, which aligns with the torus's symmetry. The generating circle lies in the xy-plane, centered at (6,0,0). The main difference among the agents is the placement of the sphere's center: Agent MKbM and Agent Xzh3 place the sphere center somewhere along the z-axis at (0,0,c) or (0,0,h), leaving the vertical coordinate variable to be determined by tangency conditions, while Agent zybX places the sphere center at the origin (0,0,0) for convenience. Placing the sphere center at (0,0,c) with c variable is more general and flexible, allowing analysis of the torus's vertical position relative to the sphere to find the tangency circles. This approach respects the symmetry of the torus and sphere and facilitates solving for the tangency conditions without prematurely fixing the vertical offset. Therefore, the most consistent and suitable answer is to fix the torus axis as the z-axis, place the generating circle in the xy-plane centered at (6,0,0), and place the sphere center at (0,0,c) on the z-axis with c variable. This setup allows for a systematic study of the relative positions and tangency conditions between the torus and sphere. The sphere radius is 11, the torus generating circle radius is 3, and the major radius (distance from axis to circle center) is 6. This coordinate system and parameterization are standard and appropriate for the problem.; answer - {'sphere_radius': 11, 'coordinate_system': {'axis_of_revolution': 'z-axis', 'torus_generating_circle_center': '(6, 0, 0) in the xy-plane', 'sphere_center': '(0, 0, c) on the z-axis, with c variable'}}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - All three Chain-of-Thought agents provide consistent reasoning about the necessity of introducing a vertical translation parameter d to the torus equation to model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6, giving the standard torus equation (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. However, to capture the two different tangent circles formed when the torus rests externally tangent to the sphere of radius 11, the torus must be allowed to shift vertically along the z-axis. This vertical shift is represented by d, modifying the torus equation to (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9. The parameter d is essential because the sphere is fixed in space, and the torus can be positioned at different heights relative to the sphere, each height corresponding to a different tangent circle on the torus surface. Treating d as an unknown allows solving the tangency conditions to find the exact vertical positions where the torus and sphere are tangent externally along circles of radii r_i and r_o. Fixing d prematurely would restrict the analysis to a single configuration and potentially miss the other tangent circle. Therefore, the most consistent and complete answer is that d is a vertical translation parameter along the z-axis introduced into the torus equation to model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere, and it must remain an unknown to be solved from the tangency conditions.; answer - The vertical translation parameter d is introduced into the torus surface equation as (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9 to represent the vertical displacement of the torus center along the z-axis. This parameter d is necessary to model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere of radius 11 because the torus can rest at different heights relative to the sphere, each producing a different tangent circle. Treating d as an unknown allows solving the tangency conditions to find the exact vertical positions corresponding to the tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o. Fixing d prematurely would limit the analysis to a single configuration and miss the other. Hence, d must remain a variable to be determined from the geometric constraints of tangency.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All three agents provide a consistent and detailed derivation of the external tangency conditions between the torus and the sphere along a circle at height z = h. They start with the torus defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis at a distance 6, and introduce a vertical translation d to the torus to model different tangent positions. The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11. The contact circle lies in the plane z = h with radius rho in the xy-plane. The torus surface equation at the contact circle is (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9, reflecting the torus's geometry. The sphere surface equation at the contact circle is rho^2 + h^2 = 121, reflecting the sphere's geometry. The tangency condition requires the surface normals to be parallel along the contact circle. By computing gradients of the implicit functions defining the torus and sphere, and equating them up to a scalar multiple, the condition (h - d) * rho = (rho - 6) * h emerges. This condition relates the vertical translation d, the height h, and the radius rho of the contact circle. This system of three equations fully characterizes the external tangency conditions. The derivations are mathematically rigorous, clearly state all assumptions, and avoid skipping steps. The slight differences in presentation among the agents do not affect the correctness or completeness of the system. Therefore, the most consistent and complete tangency conditions are: (1) (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9, (2) rho^2 + h^2 = 121, and (3) (h - d) * rho = (rho - 6) * h. These equations can be used to solve for d, h, and rho to find the tangent circles' radii and positions.; answer - (1) (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9\n(2) rho^2 + h^2 = 121\n(3) (h - d) * rho = (rho - 6) * h\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We start with the system of equations for external tangency of the torus and sphere along a circle at height z = h with radius rho, and vertical translation d of the torus:\n\n1) (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9  (torus surface condition)\n2) rho^2 + h^2 = 121           (sphere surface condition)\n3) (h - d) * rho = (rho - 6) * h (tangency condition)\n\nFrom (3), we solve for d: d = 6 * h / rho.\n\nSubstituting d into (1) and using (2) to express h^2, we derive a quadratic in rho, yielding two positive solutions:\nrho_1 = 33/4 = 8.25 and rho_2 = 33/7 â‰ˆ 4.7142857.\n\nFor each rho, h = Â± sqrt(121 - rho^2), and d = 6 * h / rho.\n\nChecking physical constraints (minor radius 3), we verify |h - d| â‰¤ 3 for all four sign combinations, so all are physically meaningful.\n\nSince the problem concerns the torus resting externally on the sphere, we select the positive h and d values for each rho as the two external tangent configurations:\n\n- Inner tangent: (d_i, h_i) = (6 * h_i / rho_i, h_i) with rho_i = 33/7, h_i = sqrt(121 - (33/7)^2)\n- Outer tangent: (d_o, h_o) = (6 * h_o / rho_o, h_o) with rho_o = 33/4, h_o = sqrt(121 - (33/4)^2)\n\nThis selection is consistent with the problem's physical setup and the minor radius bounds, providing two distinct, real, and physically meaningful solutions for the external tangent configurations.; answer - {'d_i': '6 * sqrt(121 - (33/7)^2) / (33/7)', 'h_i': 'sqrt(121 - (33/7)^2)', 'd_o': '6 * sqrt(121 - (33/4)^2) / (33/4)', 'h_o': 'sqrt(121 - (33/4)^2)'}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We have two sets of solutions (d_i, h_i) and (d_o, h_o) corresponding to two external tangent configurations of the torus and sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the circle's center, so the minor radius is 3 and the major radius is 6. The sphere has radius 11. From previous sub-tasks, we have rho_i = 33/7 and rho_o = 33/4. We calculate h_i = sqrt(121 - (33/7)^2) and h_o = sqrt(121 - (33/4)^2). Then d_i = 6 * h_i / rho_i and d_o = 6 * h_o / rho_o. We verify that the quantities under the square roots for r_i and r_o are nonnegative by checking (h_i - d_i)^2 <= 9 and (h_o - d_o)^2 <= 9, since r = sqrt(9 - (h - d)^2). Calculations show h_i â‰ˆ 9.938, d_i â‰ˆ 12.647, so h_i - d_i â‰ˆ -2.709, and (h_i - d_i)^2 â‰ˆ 7.34. Similarly, h_o â‰ˆ 7.276, d_o â‰ˆ 5.290, so h_o - d_o â‰ˆ 1.986, and (h_o - d_o)^2 â‰ˆ 3.944. Both are less than 9, so the square roots are defined. Then r_i = sqrt(9 - 7.34) â‰ˆ 1.288 and r_o = sqrt(9 - 3.944) â‰ˆ 2.249. These values are physically feasible and consistent with the torus geometry, as both are less than the minor radius 3.

Since the torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, and this axis is a distance 6 from the center of the circle, it is natural to align the axis of revolution of the torus with one of the coordinate axes, say the z-axis.

This coordinate system allows analysis of the relative positions of the torus and sphere without assuming any particular vertical translation of the torus.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 9hMm, defining vertical translation d and torus equation, thinking: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 around an axis (the z-axis) that is a distance R = 6 from the center of the circle. The standard equation of such a torus centered at the origin with its axis along the z-axis is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. However, to model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere S of radius 11, we need to consider vertical translations of the torus along the z-axis. This is because the torus can be positioned at different heights relative to the sphere, resulting in different tangent circles where the torus and sphere touch externally. Introducing a vertical translation parameter d allows us to shift the torus up or down along the z-axis without changing its shape or orientation. The modified torus surface equation becomes (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + (z - d)^2 = r^2, where d is the vertical displacement of the torus center from the origin. This parameter d is necessary because the two distinct external tangency configurations correspond to two different vertical positions of the torus relative to the sphere. By treating d as an unknown, we can solve for its values from the tangency conditions between the torus and the sphere, thus determining the exact positions where the torus is tangent to the sphere along circles of radii r_i and r_o. Fixing d prematurely would limit the analysis and potentially miss one of the tangent configurations. Therefore, d must remain a variable to be determined from the geometric constraints of tangency.; answer: The vertical translation parameter d is introduced to represent the vertical displacement of the torus along the z-axis.

This vertical translation is necessary because the torus can rest on the sphere in different vertical positions, each producing a different circle of tangency on the torus surface. Introducing a vertical translation parameter d shifts the torus along the z-axis, modifying the torus surface equation to (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + (z - d)^2 = r^2. This parameter d is essential to capture the relative vertical positioning of the torus with respect to the sphere, allowing us to model and solve for the two distinct tangent circles characterized by radii r_i and r_o.

To model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere S of radius 11, we introduce a vertical translation d along the z-axis to the torus, modifying its equation to (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9. The sphere S is centered at the origin with equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. The torus and sphere are tangent externally along a circle at height z = h.

The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, with the circle's center at a distance 6 from the axis. To model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere S of radius 11, we introduce a vertical translation parameter d along the z-axis. This shifts the torus vertically, allowing it to be tangent to the sphere at different heights. The sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11. The torus surface equation, after vertical translation by d, is given by (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9. We consider the tangency along a circle at height z = h. At this height, the intersection circle on the torus has radius rho = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The sphere surface equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. At the contact circle, z = h, so the sphere radius in the xy-plane is sqrt(121 - h^2). For the torus and sphere to be tangent along this circle, three conditions must hold: (1) The point (rho, h) lies on the torus surface: (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9. (2) The point (rho, h) lies on the sphere surface: rho^2 + h^2 = 121. (3) The surfaces are tangent along the circle, so their surface normals at the contact circle are parallel. The surface normal to the torus at (x, y, z) is proportional to the gradient of the torus implicit function F(x, y, z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 - 9 = 0. The gradient is grad F = (2(r - 6)(x/r), 2(r - 6)(y/r), 2(z - d)), where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). At the contact circle, r = rho, z = h. The surface normal to the sphere at (x, y, z) is proportional to the gradient of G(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 121 = 0, which is grad G = (2x, 2y, 2z). At the contact circle, this is (2x, 2y, 2h). For the normals to be parallel, their components must be proportional: grad F = lambda * grad G for some scalar lambda. Considering the x and y components, since x and y are arbitrary on the circle, the proportionality implies (r - 6)/r = lambda, and for the z component, (h - d) = lambda * h. Combining these gives (h - d)/h = (r - 6)/r. Substituting r = rho, we get (h - d)/h = (rho - 6)/rho. Thus, the system of equations is: (1) (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9, (2) rho^2 + h^2 = 121, (3) (h - d)/h = (rho - 6)/rho. These three equations relate the variables d, h, and rho, and represent the external tangency conditions between the torus and the sphere along the circle at height z = h. This formulation is complete and explicit, with all assumptions and variables clearly stated, and no steps skipped.; answer: The external tangency conditions between the torus and the sphere along a circle at height z = h, with vertical translation d of the torus and contact circle radius rho, are given by the system of equations:\n\n(1) Torus surface equation at the contact circle:\n   (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9\n\n(2) Sphere surface equation at the contact circle:\n   rho^2 + h^2 = 121\n\n(3) Equality of surface normals (tangency condition):\n   (h - d)/h = (rho - 6)/rho\n\nwhere:\n- rho = radius of the contact circle in the xy-plane,\n- h = height of the contact circle (z-coordinate),\n- d = vertical translation of the torus along the z-axis.\n\nThese equations fully describe the external tangency conditions along the circle at height z = h.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent at8H, formulating tangency conditions, thinking: We start by defining the variables and assumptions clearly. The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, where the center of the circle is at a distance 6 from the axis. To model the two distinct external tangency configurations with the sphere S of radius 11, we introduce a vertical translation parameter d along the z-axis. This shifts the torus vertically, allowing it to be tangent to the sphere at different heights. The sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0) with radius 11. The torus surface equation, after vertical translation by d, is given by: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9. The sphere surface equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. The external tangency occurs along a circle at height z = h. At this height, the intersection of the torus and sphere surfaces is a circle of radius rho in the xy-plane. We want to find the system of equations involving d, h, and rho that characterize this tangency. Step 1: Torus surface equation at the contact circle (z = h). Substitute z = h into the torus equation: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9. Let r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) be the radial distance in the xy-plane. Then: (r - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9. Rearranged: (r - 6)^2 = 9 - (h - d)^2. Since the contact circle lies at height h, the radius of the contact circle on the torus is rho = r. So: (rho - 6)^2 = 9 - (h - d)^2. Step 2: Sphere surface equation at the contact circle (z = h). On the sphere, at height z = h, the cross-section is a circle of radius sqrt(121 - h^2). Since the torus and sphere are tangent along the same circle, the radius rho must satisfy: rho^2 + h^2 = 121. Step 3: Tangency condition (equality of surface normals). For the surfaces to be tangent along the circle, their normals at every point on the contact circle must be parallel. The gradient vectors of the implicit surface functions give the normals. Define the torus implicit function: F(x,y,z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 - 9 = 0. Define the sphere implicit function: G(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 121 = 0. Compute gradients: âˆ‡F = (âˆ‚F/âˆ‚x, âˆ‚F/âˆ‚y, âˆ‚F/âˆ‚z), âˆ‡G = (âˆ‚G/âˆ‚x, âˆ‚G/âˆ‚y, âˆ‚G/âˆ‚z). At the contact circle, the gradients must be parallel: âˆ‡F = Î» âˆ‡G for some scalar Î». Calculate partial derivatives: Let r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Then âˆ‚F/âˆ‚x = 2(r - 6) * (x / r), âˆ‚F/âˆ‚y = 2(r - 6) * (y / r), âˆ‚F/âˆ‚z = 2(z - d). For the sphere: âˆ‚G/âˆ‚x = 2x, âˆ‚G/âˆ‚y = 2y, âˆ‚G/âˆ‚z = 2z. The parallel condition implies: (r - 6) * (x / r) = Î» x, (r - 6) * (y / r) = Î» y, (z - d) = Î» z. Since x and y are not both zero on the contact circle, from the first two equations: (r - 6) / r = Î». From the third: (z - d) = Î» z. Substitute Î» from the first into the third: (z - d) = ((r - 6) / r) * z. Rearranged: (z - d) * r = (r - 6) * z. At the contact circle, z = h and r = rho, so: (h - d) * rho = (rho - 6) * h. This is the tangency condition relating d, h, and rho. Summary of the system: 1) Torus surface at contact circle: (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9. 2) Sphere surface at contact circle: rho^2 + h^2 = 121. 3) Tangency condition: (h - d) * rho = (rho - 6) * h. These three equations in variables d, h, and rho characterize the external tangency of the torus and sphere along a circle at height h with radius rho.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the circle's center. The sphere has radius 11. The tangent circles on the torus surface have radii r_i and r_o, which we need to compute. The relation given is r = sqrt(9 - (h - d)^2), where 9 is the square of the minor radius of the torus (3^2). This formula comes from the torus cross-section circle equation: (rho - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9, where (h - d) is the vertical distance from the center of the revolving circle to the tangent circle, and r is the radius of the tangent circle on the torus surface.
