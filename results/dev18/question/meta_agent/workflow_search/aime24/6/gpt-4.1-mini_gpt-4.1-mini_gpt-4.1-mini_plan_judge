Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The problem is to find the sum p + q where r^2 = p/q is the squared radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius r is half the space diagonal of the box, so r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. We want to maximize the space diagonal squared d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 under the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. By symmetry, set x = y = t and z = s. From the volume constraint, s = 23 / t^2. The surface area constraint becomes 2(t^2 + 2 t s) = 54, or t^2 + 2 t s = 27. Substitute s to get t^2 + 46 / t = 27, multiply both sides by t to get t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0. The positive roots are t=2 and approximately t=3.899. For t=2, s=5.75, and d^2 = 2*4 + 5.75^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16. For t â‰ˆ 3.899, d^2 is smaller. So the maximum d^2 is 657/16. Then r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. The fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms since 657 factors as 3^2 * 73 and 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. Therefore, p = 657, q = 64, and p + q = 721. This reasoning is consistent across multiple independent analyses, confirming the answer.
