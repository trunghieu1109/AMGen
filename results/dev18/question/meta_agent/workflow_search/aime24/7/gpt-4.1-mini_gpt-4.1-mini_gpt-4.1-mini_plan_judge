proposed answer: We start with the given equations: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Rewriting these in exponential form gives y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. From the first equation, y^x = x^{10}, taking the x-th root, we get y = x^{10/x}. From the second equation, x^{4y} = y^{10}, taking the 10-th root, we get y = (x^{4y})^{1/10} = x^{(4y)/10} = x^{2y/5}. Equating the two expressions for y, we have x^{10/x} = x^{2y/5}. Since x > 1, we can equate the exponents: 10/x = 2y/5, which simplifies to y = 25/x. Substituting y = 25/x back into the first equation y^x = x^{10} gives (25/x)^x = x^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, x ln(25/x) = 10 ln x. This is a transcendental equation in x, but importantly, the product xy = x * (25/x) = 25. This product is constant regardless of the exact values of x and y, as long as they satisfy the equations and domain constraints (x > 1, y > 1). Therefore, the product xy = 25 is the consistent and correct answer to the problem.
