Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the given conditions and previously found values. Aya walks 9 km every morning. The coffee break time t is constant. When walking at speed s, total time is 4 hours; when walking at speed s+2, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (2.4 hours). From these, we derived two equations: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4 and (9/(s+2)) + (t/60) = 2.4. Subtracting the second from the first eliminates t/60, giving 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving this yields s = 2.5 km/h. Substituting back to find t, we get t = 24 minutes. Step 2: Check the units and calculations. Walking time at s=2.5 km/h is 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3 hours 36 minutes. Adding coffee break 24 minutes gives total 4 hours, consistent with the problem. Similarly, at s+2=4.5 km/h, walking time is 9/4.5 = 2 hours, plus 24 minutes coffee break = 2 hours 24 minutes, matching the problem. Step 3: Calculate total time at s+0.5=3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Adding coffee break 24 minutes (0.4 hours) gives 3.4 hours = 204 minutes. Step 4: Verify consistency. The coffee break time t is constant and the walking times plus coffee break times match the given total times for speeds s and s+2. The units are consistent throughout (hours for speeds and times, minutes converted properly). The final total time at s+0.5 is logically between the two given total times, as expected. Step 5: Consider possible errors. The main potential errors could be in unit conversion or algebraic manipulation. However, all conversions and algebraic steps have been carefully checked and are correct. Step 6: Conclusion. The computed total time of 204 minutes at speed s+0.5 km/h is consistent with the problem conditions, units, and previous calculations, with no contradictions or errors found.
