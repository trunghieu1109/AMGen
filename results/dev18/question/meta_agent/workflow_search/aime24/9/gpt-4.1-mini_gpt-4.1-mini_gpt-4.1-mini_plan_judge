Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_9
proposed answer: The problem asks for the sum m + n where m/n is the reduced fraction representing the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize. The grand prize event occurs only if the 4 numbers drawn exactly match Jen's chosen 4 numbers, so there is exactly 1 favorable outcome for the grand prize. The prize event occurs if at least 2 of Jen's chosen numbers are among the 4 drawn numbers. Counting these outcomes yields 115 favorable outcomes. Since the total number of 4-number subsets from 10 numbers is 210, the conditional probability is the ratio of these counts: 1/115. This fraction is already in lowest terms because 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, m = 1 and n = 115, and their sum is m + n = 116. This reasoning is consistent across multiple analyses and matches the combinatorial counts, so the final answer is 116.
