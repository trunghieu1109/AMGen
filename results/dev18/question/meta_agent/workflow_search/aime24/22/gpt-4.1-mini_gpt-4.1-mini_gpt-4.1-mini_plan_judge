Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_22
proposed answer: The validated list from the previous step is [5, 7, 9, 9]. We need to compute the sum of the squares of all items in this list. Step 1: Square each item: 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49, 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81. Step 2: Sum these squares: 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the list is 236.
