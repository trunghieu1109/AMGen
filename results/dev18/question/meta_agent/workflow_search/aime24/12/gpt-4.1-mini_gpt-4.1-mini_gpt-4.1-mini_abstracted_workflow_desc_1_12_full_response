We rewrite z as 4e^{iθ}, so the expression becomes 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. To find the real part, we express e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. For the first term: 4(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4[(75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ) + (117 i cosθ + 117 i^2 sinθ)]. Since i^2 = -1, this is 4[(75 cosθ + 117 i cosθ) + (75 i sinθ - 117 sinθ)]. Grouping real and imaginary parts: real part = 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ), imaginary part = 4(117 cosθ + 75 sinθ). For the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ) + (36 i cosθ - 36 i^2 sinθ) = (24 cosθ - 36 sinθ) + i(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ). So the real part is 24 cosθ - 36 sinθ. Adding the real parts: 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + (24 cosθ - 36 sinθ) = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ - 36 sinθ) = (324 cosθ - 504 sinθ). This matches the derivations by agents Z9Ct and PNUR, which carefully track signs and magnitudes. The third agent fB9f made a sign error in the second term\'s real part (adding 36 sinθ instead of subtracting 36 sinθ). Therefore, the most consistent and correct real part expression is 324 cosθ - 504 sinθ.\n\n### Sub-task 3b: Synthesize and choose the most consistent verification of coefficients.Given all the above thinking and answers, find the most consistent and correct verification of coefficients. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent POap:\nAll three Chain-of-Thought agents (rP8O, aZQK, and 6DWg) independently performed the algebraic verification of the coefficients for the cosine and sine terms in the real part expression derived from the original complex expression. Each agent followed the same step-by-step approach: \n\n1. Express z as 4e^{iθ} and rewrite the expression accordingly.\n2. Expand the terms using Euler\'s formula for e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}.\n3. Separate real and imaginary parts carefully, paying attention to the sign of i^2 = -1.\n4. Sum the real parts from both terms.\n5. Verify the coefficients of cosθ and sinθ by comparing them to the original constants multiplied by the appropriate factors.\n\nAll three agents arrived at the same final real part expression: 324 cosθ - 504 sinθ. They also confirmed the coefficients by showing that 324 = 4*75 + 24 and -504 = 4*(-117) + (-36), which matches the algebraic expansions perfectly. The signs and magnitudes are consistent, and no errors were found in any step.\n\nGiven the complete agreement and detailed stepwise verification by all agents, the most consistent and correct verification of coefficients is the expression for the real part as 324 cosθ - 504 sinθ, with coefficients verified as above. This conclusion is justified by the identical and thorough algebraic expansions, sign checks, and coefficient confirmations performed independently by multiple agents, ensuring reliability and correctness.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Synthesize and choose the most consistent combined trigonometric form.Given all the above thinking and answers, find the most consistent and correct combined trigonometric form with amplitude R and phase φ. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Ks7S:\nWe start with the expression for the real part: 324 cos(θ) - 504 sin(θ). We want to express this in the form R cos(θ + φ). Using the identity R cos(θ + φ) = R cos(θ) cos(φ) - R sin(θ) sin(φ), we match coefficients: 324 = R cos(φ) and -504 = -R sin(φ), so 504 = R sin(φ).\n\nStep 1: Calculate R = sqrt(324^2 + 504^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 254,016) = sqrt(358,992).\n\nStep 2: Simplify sqrt(358,992). Factor 324 and 504 by their gcd 18: 324 = 18*18, 504 = 18*28. Then R = 18 * sqrt(18^2 + 28^2) = 18 * sqrt(324 + 784) = 18 * sqrt(1108).\n\nStep 3: Simplify sqrt(1108) = sqrt(4*277) = 2 sqrt(277). So R = 18 * 2 * sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277).\n\nStep 4: Find cos(φ) = 324 / R = 324 / (36 sqrt(277)) = 9 / sqrt(277), and sin(φ) = 504 / R = 504 / (36 sqrt(277)) = 14 / sqrt(277).\n\nStep 5: Verify cos^2(φ) + sin^2(φ) = (9^2 + 14^2)/277 = (81 + 196)/277 = 277/277 = 1, confirming correctness.\n\nStep 6: Since both cos(φ) and sin(φ) are positive, φ is in the first quadrant.\n\nTherefore, the combined trigonometric form is 36 sqrt(277) cos(θ + φ), where cos(φ) = 9 / sqrt(277) and sin(φ) = 14 / sqrt(277). This form is exact, consistent, and derived step-by-step with no approximations or sign errors, making it the most correct and consistent combined form.\n\n### Sub-task 5: Final algebraic and numeric verification.Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final verified algebraic and numeric validation of the combined coefficients and amplitude R and phase φ. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 5xaO:\nWe start with the original expression for the real part of the given complex expression in terms of θ: 324 cos(θ) - 504 sin(θ). The goal is to express this as a single cosine function with amplitude R and phase φ: R cos(θ + φ). Using the identity R cos(θ + φ) = R cos(θ) cos(φ) - R sin(θ) sin(φ), we equate coefficients: 324 = R cos(φ) and -504 = -R sin(φ) which implies 504 = R sin(φ).\n\nStep 1: Calculate R = sqrt(324^2 + 504^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 254,016) = sqrt(358,992).\n\nStep 2: Simplify R by factoring: 324 = 18 * 18 and 504 = 18 * 28, so R = 18 * sqrt(18^2 + 28^2) = 18 * sqrt(324 + 784) = 18 * sqrt(1108).\n\nStep 3: Simplify sqrt(1108) = sqrt(4 * 277) = 2 sqrt(277), so R = 18 * 2 * sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277).\n\nStep 4: Calculate cos(φ) = 324 / R = 324 / (36 sqrt(277)) = 9 / sqrt(277), and sin(φ) = 504 / R = 504 / (36 sqrt(277)) = 14 / sqrt(277).\n\nStep 5: Verify cos^2(φ) + sin^2(φ) = (9^2 + 14^2) / 277 = (81 + 196) / 277 = 277 / 277 = 1, confirming the correctness of the phase angle.\n\nStep 6: Both cos(φ) and sin(φ) are positive, so φ lies in the first quadrant.\n\nStep 7: Numeric sanity check: Substitute θ = -φ so that cos(θ + φ) = cos(0) = 1. Then the original expression should equal R = 36 sqrt(277).\n\nCalculate the original expression at θ = -φ: Re = 324 cos(-φ) - 504 sin(-φ) = 324 cos(φ) + 504 sin(φ) = 324 * (9 / sqrt(277)) + 504 * (14 / sqrt(277)) = (2916 + 7056) / sqrt(277) = 9972 / sqrt(277).\n\nSince R = 36 sqrt(277), check if 9972 / sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277): 9972 / sqrt(277) = 36 * 277 / sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277), confirming equality.\n\nStep 8: Reverse check by expanding R cos(θ + φ) with the found values of R and φ to ensure it matches the original coefficients 324 and -504: R cos(φ) = 324 and R sin(φ) = 504, exactly as required.\n\nNo discrepancies are found. The derivation is exact and consistent with the original coefficients from subtask_3b. The numeric check confirms the amplitude and phase are correct. Other agents\' solutions align with this result, reinforcing its correctness.\n\nTherefore, the combined trigonometric form R cos(θ + φ) with R = 36 sqrt(277), cos(φ) = 9 / sqrt(277), and sin(φ) = 14 / sqrt(277) is verified and correct.\n\n### Sub-task 6: Determine the maximum value of the real part expression over θ in [0, 2π) using the simplified trigonometric form from subtask_4. Provide a detailed explanation of the maximization process, including the identification of θ that achieves the maximum. Cross-check all previous subtasks\' outputs (3a, 3b, 4, 5) to ensure consistency. If any inconsistency or error is detected, trigger a feedback loop to request re-execution or correction of relevant earlier subtasks. Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent MEuk:\nWe have the real part expression in the combined trigonometric form: R cos(θ + φ), where R = 36√277, cos(φ) = 9/√277, and sin(φ) = 14/√277. The goal is to find the maximum value of this expression over θ in [0, 2π). Since cosine function achieves its maximum value 1 at an angle of 0, the maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is simply R. This maximum is attained when θ + φ = 0 (mod 2π), or equivalently θ = -φ (mod 2π). This means the angle θ that maximizes the real part is θ = -φ, where φ is the phase angle defined by cos(φ) = 9/√277 and sin(φ) = 14/√277. Cross-checking with previous subtasks: Subtask 3a and 3b confirm the coefficients 324 and -504 for cosθ and sinθ terms respectively; Subtask 4 and 5 confirm the amplitude R = 36√277 and phase φ with the given cosine and sine values. All derivations are consistent and verified algebraically and numerically. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part expression is 36√277, achieved at θ = -φ. This completes the maximization process with full consistency and correctness.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Verify the maximum real part value found in subtask_6 by cross-checking it against all previous subtasks\' outputs, including the original expression, coefficient derivations, and combined trigonometric form.

The polar form of a complex number is given by z = r * e^(iθ), where r is the modulus (distance from the origin) and θ is the argument (angle with the positive real axis). Since |z| = 4, we set r = 4. The argument θ can take any value from 0 to 2π to cover the entire circle. Therefore, the complex number z can be expressed as z = 4e^(iθ) with θ in the domain [0, 2π). This parametrization restricts z to the circle of radius 4 in the complex plane, as the modulus is fixed and only the angle varies. At this stage, no further substitution or simplification is needed, as the problem only asks for expressing z in polar form with the given modulus and domain for θ.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ} where θ ∈ [0, 2π). This parametrization restricts z to the circle of radius 4 in the complex plane.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem requires rewriting the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z in terms of θ, given that z = 4e^{iθ} and |z|=4. The key is to substitute z and simplify each term separately without combining terms or extracting the real part. \n\nStep 1: Substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the first term:\n(75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.\n\nStep 2: Substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the second term:\n(96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{iθ})) = (1/4)(96 + 144i)e^{-iθ}.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the second term's coefficient:\n(1/4)(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.\n\nThis matches the answer given by agent lTJ7, which is the most complete and simplified form without combining terms or extracting real parts. The other answers either left the second term as (1/4)(96 + 144i)e^{-iθ} without simplifying the coefficient or did not explicitly simplify it to (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. Simplifying the coefficient is a straightforward arithmetic step and does not combine terms or extract real parts, so it is appropriate here.\n\nHence, the most consistent and correct rewritten expression is:\n4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.\n\nThis expression clearly shows each term separately in terms of e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, with coefficients simplified, fulfilling the problem's requirements.; answer - 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - We start with the given expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We rewrite z as 4e^{iθ}, so the expression becomes 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. To find the real part, we express e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. For the first term: 4(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4[(75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ) + (117 i cosθ + 117 i^2 sinθ)]. Since i^2 = -1, this is 4[(75 cosθ + 117 i cosθ) + (75 i sinθ - 117 sinθ)]. Grouping real and imaginary parts: real part = 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ), imaginary part = 4(117 cosθ + 75 sinθ). For the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ) + (36 i cosθ - 36 i^2 sinθ) = (24 cosθ - 36 sinθ) + i(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ). So the real part is 24 cosθ - 36 sinθ. Adding the real parts: 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + (24 cosθ - 36 sinθ) = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ - 36 sinθ) = (324 cosθ - 504 sinθ). This matches the derivations by agents Z9Ct and PNUR, which carefully track signs and magnitudes. The third agent fB9f made a sign error in the second term's real part (adding 36 sinθ instead of subtracting 36 sinθ).

Using the identity R cos(θ + φ) = R cos(θ) cos(φ) - R sin(θ) sin(φ), we equate coefficients: 324 = R cos(φ) and -504 = -R sin(φ) which implies 504 = R sin(φ).\n\nStep 1: Calculate R = sqrt(324^2 + 504^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 254,016) = sqrt(358,992).\n\nStep 2: Simplify R by factoring: 324 = 18 * 18 and 504 = 18 * 28, so R = 18 * sqrt(18^2 + 28^2) = 18 * sqrt(324 + 784) = 18 * sqrt(1108).\n\nStep 3: Simplify sqrt(1108) = sqrt(4 * 277) = 2 sqrt(277), so R = 18 * 2 * sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277).\n\nStep 4: Calculate cos(φ) = 324 / R = 324 / (36 sqrt(277)) = 9 / sqrt(277), and sin(φ) = 504 / R = 504 / (36 sqrt(277)) = 14 / sqrt(277).\n\nStep 5: Verify cos^2(φ) + sin^2(φ) = (9^2 + 14^2) / 277 = (81 + 196) / 277 = 277 / 277 = 1, confirming the correctness of the phase angle.\n\nStep 6: Both cos(φ) and sin(φ) are positive, so φ lies in the first quadrant.\n\nStep 7: Numeric sanity check: Substitute θ = -φ so that cos(θ + φ) = cos(0) = 1. Then the original expression should equal R = 36 sqrt(277).\n\nCalculate the original expression at θ = -φ: Re = 324 cos(-φ) - 504 sin(-φ) = 324 cos(φ) + 504 sin(φ) = 324 * (9 / sqrt(277)) + 504 * (14 / sqrt(277)) = (2916 + 7056) / sqrt(277) = 9972 / sqrt(277).\n\nSince R = 36 sqrt(277), check if 9972 / sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277): 9972 / sqrt(277) = 36 * 277 / sqrt(277) = 36 sqrt(277), confirming equality.\n\nStep 8: Reverse check by expanding R cos(θ + φ) with the found values of R and φ to ensure it matches the original coefficients 324 and -504: R cos(φ) = 324 and R sin(φ) = 504, exactly as required.\n\nNo discrepancies are found. The derivation is exact and consistent with the original coefficients from subtask_3b. The numeric check confirms the amplitude and phase are correct.

The goal is to find the maximum value of this expression over θ in [0, 2π). Since cosine function achieves its maximum value 1 at an angle of 0, the maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is simply R. This maximum is attained when θ + φ = 0 (mod 2π), or equivalently θ = -φ (mod 2π). This means the angle θ that maximizes the real part is θ = -φ, where φ is the phase angle defined by cos(φ) = 9/√277 and sin(φ) = 14/√277.

The polar form of a complex number is given by z = r * e^(iθ), where r is the modulus (distance from the origin) and θ is the argument (angle with the positive real axis). Since |z| = 4, we set r = 4. The argument θ can take any value from 0 to 2π to cover the entire circle. Therefore, the complex number z can be expressed as z = 4e^(iθ) with θ in the domain [0, 2π). This parametrization restricts z to the circle of radius 4 in the complex plane, as the modulus is fixed and only the angle varies. At this stage, no further substitution or simplification is needed, as the problem only asks for expressing z in polar form with the given modulus and domain for θ.; answer: z = 4e^{iθ} where θ ∈ [0, 2π).
