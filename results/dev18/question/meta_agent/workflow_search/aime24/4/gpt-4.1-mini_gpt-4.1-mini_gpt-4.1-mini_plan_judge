proposed answer: We are tasked with finding the least prime p such that there exists a positive integer n with p^2 dividing n^4 + 1, and then the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. The problem reduces to solving the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). First, for p to divide n^4 + 1, we must have n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Since the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, the existence of n with n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) implies that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. This requires that the order of n modulo p is 8, so 8 divides p-1, or equivalently, p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 8 is 17. Checking n=2, 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), so n=2 works modulo 17. To lift this solution modulo 17 to modulo 17^2=289, we use Hensel's lemma. The derivative f'(n) = 4n^3 mod 17 at n=2 is 4*8=32 ≡ 15 mod 17, which is invertible modulo 17, so the solution lifts uniquely to modulo 289. The lifting process shows that the least positive integer m satisfying m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289) is m=2. Therefore, the least prime p is 17, and the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is 2.

proposed answer: The problem is to find the least prime p such that there exists a positive integer n with p^2 dividing n^4 + 1, and then find the least positive integer m such that p^2 divides m^4 + 1. First, we check all primes less than 17: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. For each, we verify if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) has a solution and if it can be lifted to modulo p^2. For primes less than 17, no n satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, so no p^2 divides n^4 + 1. For p=17, n=2 satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 mod 17 since 2^4=16 ≡ -1 mod 17. Next, we attempt to lift this solution modulo 289 (17^2) using Hensel's lemma. We set m = n + 17k = 2 + 17k and want m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289. Using the derivative and Hensel's lemma, we solve 4 n^3 k ≡ -a mod 17, where a = (n^4 + 1)/17 = 1. Calculating 4 n^3 mod 17: n=2, n^3=8, so 4*8=32 ≡ 15 mod 17. The congruence is 15 k ≡ -1 ≡ 16 mod 17. The inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8, so k ≡ 16*8 = 128 ≡ 9 mod 17. Thus, k=9 and m=2 + 17*9=155. Verifying m^4 + 1 mod 289: 155^2 mod 289 = 38, so 155^4 = 38^2 = 1444 ≡ -1 mod 289, thus m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289. Therefore, p=17 is the least prime with the property, and m=155 is the least positive integer such that 17^2 divides m^4 + 1.
