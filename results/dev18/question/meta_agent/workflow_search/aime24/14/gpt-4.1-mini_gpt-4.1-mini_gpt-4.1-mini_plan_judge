Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The problem reduces to analyzing the function BD^2 = 480 * (11 y_a^2 + 120) / (11 y_a^2 - 600) with domain y_a^2 > 600/11. This domain ensures the denominator is positive and BD^2 is positive. We want the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, which means finding the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD^2 over this domain. 

Step 1: Examine the behavior near the domain boundary y_a^2 = 600/11. As y_a^2 approaches 600/11 from above, the denominator approaches zero from the positive side, making BD^2 tend to +∞. So BD^2 is unbounded above.

Step 2: Examine the behavior as y_a^2 → ∞. The function behaves like 480 * (11 y_a^2) / (11 y_a^2) = 480, so BD^2 approaches 480 from above.

Step 3: Compute the derivative of BD^2 with respect to y_a^2 to find critical points. The derivative is negative for all y_a^2 > 600/11, indicating BD^2 is strictly decreasing on the domain.

Step 4: Since BD^2 is strictly decreasing from +∞ to 480 over the domain, it takes all values greater than 480 but never reaches 480. Therefore, the infimum of BD^2 is 480.

Step 5: The problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, which corresponds to this infimum, 480.

Step 6: Verify that all constraints (points on hyperbola, rhombus properties, diagonals intersecting at origin and perpendicularity) are satisfied for the domain considered.

Conclusion: The greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480. This is the most consistent and justified solution based on the function's behavior and problem constraints.
