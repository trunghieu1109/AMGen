Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 1, we have decomposed the total number of rectangles into 8 groups (k=1 to 8), each group containing 3 rectangles, giving a total of 24 rectangles. This decomposition is based on the parametrization of rectangles by vertex indices in the regular dodecagon, where each rectangle corresponds to a quadruple of vertices (V_a, V_{a+k}, V_{a+k+3}, V_{a+3}) modulo 12. The initial count of 96 rectangles (12 values of a times 8 values of k) is reduced by dividing by 4 due to counting each rectangle 4 times by cyclic permutations of vertices, resulting in 24 distinct rectangles. This count includes all rectangles whose sides lie on sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, as required. The reasoning is consistent with the symmetry and combinatorial structure of the regular dodecagon and the conditions for rectangles. Therefore, summing all components yields the final total number of rectangles as 24.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks and symmetry classification, we have identified that the total 36 rectangles formed by parameters (k,m) in {(1,5), (2,4), (3,3)} and vertex index a=0,...,11 are grouped into 5 distinct symmetry classes under the dihedral group D_12. Specifically, the (1,5) rectangles split into 2 classes, the (2,4) rectangles split into 2 classes, and the (3,3) rectangles (which are squares) form 1 class. Each of the (1,5) and (2,4) classes corresponds to 6 rectangles (due to symmetry reduction), and the (3,3) class corresponds to 12 rectangles. Summing these distinct classes, we get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 classes, but the question asks for the total number of distinct rectangles, not classes. Since each class represents a set of rectangles equivalent under symmetry, the total number of distinct rectangles is the number of classes, which is 5. This is because counting all 36 rectangles without symmetry would overcount equivalent rectangles. The symmetry reduction ensures no double counting. Therefore, the final total number of distinct rectangles formed inside the regular dodecagon with sides on its sides or diagonals is 5. Previous attempts might have erred by counting all 36 rectangles without factoring in symmetry or by misclassifying the symmetry classes. Careful group action analysis and orbit-stabilizer considerations confirm this result.
