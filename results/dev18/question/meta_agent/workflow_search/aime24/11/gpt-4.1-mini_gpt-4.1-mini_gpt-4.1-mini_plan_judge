Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The problem is to count the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) consisting of 8 right (R) steps and 8 up (U) steps, with exactly four direction changes. A direction change occurs when the step type switches from R to U or U to R. Exactly four direction changes mean the path is composed of five runs (segments) alternating between R and U steps. The path can start either with R or with U. 

If the path starts with R, the run pattern is R-U-R-U-R, which means there are 3 runs of R steps and 2 runs of U steps. The sum of the lengths of the R runs must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the U runs must be 8. The number of ways to write 8 as a sum of 3 positive integers (compositions) is C(7,2) = 21. The number of ways to write 8 as a sum of 2 positive integers is C(7,1) = 7. Therefore, for the starting with R case, the number of valid run-length assignments is 21 * 7 = 147.

If the path starts with U, the run pattern is U-R-U-R-U, which means there are 3 runs of U steps and 2 runs of R steps. By the same reasoning, the number of valid run-length assignments is 21 (for U) * 7 (for R) = 147.

Since these two cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities, the total number of lattice paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294.

This reasoning uses standard combinatorial formulas for compositions and accounts for both possible starting directions. It aligns with the analyses provided by other agents and is logically consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 294.
