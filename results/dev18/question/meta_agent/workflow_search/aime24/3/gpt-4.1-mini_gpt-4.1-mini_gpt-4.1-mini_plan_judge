Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: The fundamental domain for the variables (x,y) is determined by the periods of the inner trigonometric functions and the symmetry of the absolute value functions f and g. Specifically, sin(2πx) has period 1, but due to the absolute value and nested functions, the effective period in x is 1/2. Similarly, cos(3πy) has period 2/3, and the effective period in y remains 2/3. Therefore, the fundamental domain is the rectangle [0, 1/2] × [0, 2/3]. Within this domain, the problem reduces to counting the number of intersection points of the two implicitly defined curves. From the detailed analysis and previous sub-task conclusions, there are exactly 9 intersection points in this fundamental domain. Because the functions involved are periodic and even (due to absolute values), the entire plane can be tiled by copies of this fundamental domain shifted by integer multiples of the periods in x and y. Each such tile contains the same number of intersection points (9), and these intersection points do not overlap between tiles due to the periodicity and the nature of the functions. Hence, the total number of intersection points in the entire real plane is infinite, as the plane is covered by infinitely many such fundamental domains, each contributing 9 intersection points. Therefore, the total number of intersections of the two graphs over the entire real plane is infinite. This conclusion follows logically from the periodicity and symmetry properties of the functions and the finite count of intersections in the fundamental domain.
