Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).\n- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.\n- Q and R are defined by the division of N by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, where Q is the quotient (the thousands digit) and R is the remainder (the last three digits).\n- The task is to find the value of Q + R.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- Changing any single digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies a set of divisibility conditions for each digit position.\n- Since N is four-digit, digits can be labeled as d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 (thousands to units).\n- For each digit position i, replacing d_i with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.\n- These conditions impose modular arithmetic constraints on the digits of N.\n- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying these constraints, the maximum must be found.\n- Q and R relate to the decomposition of N into thousands and remainder parts, and their sum is the final quantity to compute.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.\n- Elementary arithmetic and digit manipulation.\n- Possibly combinatorics or systematic search to find the greatest number satisfying the conditions.\n- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem is clear in its conditions; however, it assumes standard decimal representation and that changing a digit to 1 means replacing that digit regardless of its original value.\n- It is implicit that only one digit is changed at a time, not multiple digits simultaneously.\n- The problem does not specify if leading zeros are allowed after digit replacement; presumably, the resulting number remains four-digit or at least valid as a number divisible by 7.\n- The remainder R when dividing by 1000 is the last three digits, which is straightforward.\n- No ambiguity in the division or digit positions.\n- The main challenge is to handle the modular conditions for each digit replacement and find the maximum N satisfying all.\n- Reasonable assumptions: standard base-10 digits, digit positions fixed, and single-digit replacement only..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

Using modular arithmetic modulo 7, the conditions translate into a system of congruences. From the given modular relations, we have 6*d4 ≡ 5 (mod 7), which implies d4 ≡ 2 (mod 7). Since digits are 0-9 and d4 ≠ 0, possible d4 values are 2 and 9 (because 9 mod 7 = 2). For each candidate d4, we enumerate all possible digits d3, d2, d1 in 0-9 and check the four modular conditions derived from the problem. This enumeration yields a small set of valid quadruples. From the analysis and enumeration, the consistent valid digit combinations are: (9,3,6,0), (9,3,6,7), (2,6,3,1), (2,6,3,8), (2,6,9,1), and (2,6,9,8).
