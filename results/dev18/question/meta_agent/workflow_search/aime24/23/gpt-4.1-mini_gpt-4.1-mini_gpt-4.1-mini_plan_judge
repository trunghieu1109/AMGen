Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits 0-9 such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Leading zeros are allowed as shown in the example. Let the top row digits be a, b, c and the bottom row digits be d, e, f. The row sum condition is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The column sum condition is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From the row sum, since digits are 0-9, the only way to get 999 is if a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9. Substituting d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c into the column sum gives 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99, which simplifies to a + b + c = 8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is C(10, 2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), which are valid digits. Therefore, there are 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both conditions. This matches the problem requirements and the example given.

proposed answer: The counting process is based on the key insight that the sum conditions impose the following constraints on the digits in the 2x3 grid: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, with each digit between 0 and 9. Given these, once (a,b,c) are chosen such that a + b + c = 8 and 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 9, the digits (d,e,f) are uniquely determined as (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). Since all these digits are within 0 to 9, every such triple (a,b,c) corresponds to a valid grid. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is given by the stars-and-bars formula C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. This counting matches the example grid provided (a=0,b=0,c=8,d=9,e=9,f=1), which satisfies both sum conditions. The logical consistency is confirmed by verifying the example and the constraints. Therefore, the counting process is complete and correct, yielding exactly 45 distinct digit placements satisfying the problem's conditions.

Answer:The counting process is complete and correct, and the total number of distinct digit placements in the 2x3 grid satisfying both sum conditions is 45.

The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.

proposed answer: We have a 2x3 grid with digits a,b,c in the first row and d,e,f in the second row. The conditions are:
1. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999:
   100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.
2. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f.
From the row sum:
100A + 10B + C = 999.
Since 999 = 900 + 90 + 9, the only way is A=9, B=9, C=9.
So each column's digits sum to 9:
a + d = 9,
b + e = 9,
c + f = 9.

From the column sum:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.
Substitute d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c:

d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c).

So column sum = 10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) = 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99.

Therefore, 9(a + b + c) = 72 => a + b + c = 8.

Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, and a + b + c = 8, and d,e,f = 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c, all digits are valid (0-9).

The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each ≤ 9 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c).

Hence, the total number of valid 2x3 digit grids satisfying both sum constraints is 45.

Let the top row digits be (a,b,c) and the bottom row digits be (d,e,f). The row sum condition is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The column sum condition is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From these, it follows that d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Substituting into the row sum equation, we get a + b + c = 8. Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is the number of combinations with repetition allowed: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f), so there are exactly 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions. This matches the example and the algebraic verification.
