Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fiqA', content='The problem requires counting the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits 0-9 such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Let the top row digits be (a,b,c) and the bottom row digits be (d,e,f). The row sum condition is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The column sum condition is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From these, it follows that d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Substituting into the row sum equation, we get a + b + c = 8. Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is the number of combinations with repetition allowed: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f), so there are exactly 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions.

Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The digits in the grid define six variables: a,b,c (top row), d,e,f (bottom row).\n- Row sums: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.\n- Column sums: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n- These two equations impose constraints linking the digits across rows and columns.\n- The conditions imply dependencies between digits in the same column and across rows.\n- The problem requires counting all digit assignments (0-9) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.\n\n3.

You are not required to answer the question — just follow what is defined in the instruction: Sub-task 3_3: Count the total number of valid digit assignments that satisfy both sum constraints and report this count as the final answer, with context from verified assignments..   \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 3_2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent verified assignments. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent RZah:\nThe problem reduces to finding all digit triples (a,b,c) where each digit is between 0 and 9, and their sum is 8. For each such triple, the bottom row digits (d,e,f) are uniquely determined as complements to 9 of the top row digits: d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c. This ensures the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. The verification by multiple agents confirms that these conditions hold exactly for all such triples, with no false positives. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with digits 0-9 is the number of combinations with repetition allowed, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Therefore, there are exactly 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions. This synthesis is consistent with the problem constraints, the example given, and the algebraic verification.\n\n\nPlease think broadly, explore multiple dimensions (e.g., effectiveness, generalizability, popularity, clarity, efficiency, potential risks), and adapt your reasoning dynamically depending on the nature of the plans.

This naming convention aligns with the example provided in the problem statement and is the most straightforward and standard approach to represent the digits in the grid. It allows for clear algebraic expressions of the sums of the rows and columns, facilitating further analysis. The definitions are consistent, clear, and effective for setting up the problem's equations and constraints. Therefore, the most consistent variable definitions are: top row digits as a, b, c and bottom row digits as d, e, f, each representing the digit in the corresponding cell from left to right.; answer - The digits in the 2x3 grid are defined as follows: the top row digits are a, b, c from left to right, and the bottom row digits are d, e, f from left to right.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 0_2 output: thinking - The problem defines six variables a, b, c, d, e, f representing the digits in the 2x3 grid, with a, b, c in the top row and d, e, f in the bottom row. The first sum constraint is that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999. This can be expressed as (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The second sum constraint is that the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99. Each column forms a 2-digit number by reading top to bottom: (10a + d), (10b + e), and (10c + f). Their sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. These two equations fully capture the problem's conditions in algebraic form using the defined variables. This formulation is consistent, clear, and directly derived from the problem statement and example.; answer - (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 0_3 output: thinking - The problem involves a 2x3 grid with digits a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. The conditions given are that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99. The example provided shows that leading zeros are allowed (e.g., 008) and digits can repeat (e.g., 9 appears multiple times). Since each cell contains a digit, it must be an integer from 0 to 9 inclusive. There is no restriction against repetition or leading zeros, as explicitly demonstrated by the example. Therefore, the most consistent assumptions and conditions on the digits a,b,c,d,e,f are: each is an integer digit from 0 to 9 inclusive; leading zeros are allowed in the numbers formed by rows and columns; digits may repeat across the grid. These assumptions are necessary to correctly model the problem and understand the solution space.; answer - Each digit a,b,c,d,e,f is an integer from 0 to 9 inclusive; leading zeros are allowed in the numbers formed by rows and columns; digits may repeat in any cells; the variables correspond to the digits in the grid as top row a,b,c and bottom row d,e,f from left to right.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1_1 output: thinking - We start with the two given equations involving digits a,b,c,d,e,f (each 0-9):\n\n1) Row sum: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999\n2) Column sum: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n\nRewrite the first equation:\n100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\nGroup terms:\n(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999\n= 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999\n\nRewrite the second equation:\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n= 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nNow, define sums:\nX = a + d\nY = b + e\nZ = c + f\n\nFrom the first equation:\n100X + 10Y + Z = 999\n\nFrom the second equation:\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\nBut (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = X + Y + Z\nSo,\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 10(a + b + c) + (X + Y + Z - (a + b + c)) = 9(a + b + c) + (X + Y + Z)\n\nSet S = a + b + c\nThen second equation becomes:\n9S + (X + Y + Z) = 99\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n100X + 10Y + Z = 999\n\nWe want to express variables to reduce independent variables. From the first equation, express Z:\nZ = 999 - 100X - 10Y\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n9S + X + Y + (999 - 100X - 10Y) = 99\n9S + X + Y + 999 - 100X - 10Y = 99\n9S + 999 + X + Y - 100X - 10Y = 99\n9S + 999 - 99X - 9Y = 99\n\nBring constants to one side:\n9S - 99X - 9Y = 99 - 999 = -900\nDivide both sides by 9:\nS - 11X - Y = -100\n\nRecall S = a + b + c, X = a + d, Y = b + e\n\nSo,\na + b + c - 11(a + d) - (b + e) = -100\nExpand:\na + b + c - 11a - 11d - b - e = -100\nGroup terms:\n(a - 11a) + (b - b) + c - 11d - e = -100\n(-10a) + 0 + c - 11d - e = -100\n\nRearranged:\nc - 10a - 11d - e = -100\n\nThis is a key simplified relationship linking c, a, d, e.\n\nSummary:\nFrom the two sum equations, the digits satisfy:\n100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999\n10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nWhich reduces to:\nZ = 999 - 100X - 10Y\nand\nc - 10a - 11d - e = -100\n\nThis expresses c in terms of a, d, e, and relates the sums of digits.

This expresses c in terms of a, d, e and relates the sums of digits, reducing the number of independent variables.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1_2 output: thinking - We start with the two main equations from the problem: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99, where a,b,c,d,e,f are digits 0-9. To analyze digit-wise modular or carry-based conditions, we consider the addition column by column for the row sums and the column sums separately. For the row sums: adding the units digits c + f must produce a units digit 9 with some carry c1 to the tens place. Similarly, b + e + c1 must produce a tens digit 9 with carry c2 to the hundreds place. Then a + d + c2 must produce a hundreds digit 9 with no further carry (since sum is 999). This gives modular conditions: (c + f) mod 10 = 9, carry c1 = floor((c + f)/10); (b + e + c1) mod 10 = 9, carry c2 = floor((b + e + c1)/10); (a + d + c2) mod 10 = 9, carry c3 = floor((a + d + c2)/10) = 0. For the column sums: sum of (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Grouping tens and units: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. Since digits are 0-9, a + b + c must be between 0 and 27, and d + e + f between 0 and 27. The equation implies d + e + f = 99 - 10(a + b + c). For this to be valid, 99 - 10(a + b + c) must be between 0 and 27, so a + b + c must be 7 or 8 or 9. This modular and carry-based breakdown allows digit-level reasoning and constraints to be applied systematically to find valid digit assignments.; answer - The digit-wise modular and carry-based conditions derived from the row sum (999) are: (c + f) mod 10 = 9 with carry c1 = floor((c + f)/10); (b + e + c1) mod 10 = 9 with carry c2 = floor((b + e + c1)/10); (a + d + c2) mod 10 = 9 with carry c3 = 0. From the column sum (99), the condition is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99, implying d + e + f = 99 - 10(a + b + c). These conditions facilitate digit-level reasoning by linking digits through modular arithmetic and carry values.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2_1 output: thinking - The problem involves a 2x3 grid with digits a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. The sums of the two 3-digit numbers formed by rows equal 999, and the sums of the three 2-digit numbers formed by columns equal 99. From the row sum, digit-wise addition with carries gives: (c+f) mod 10 = 9 with carry c1 = floor((c+f)/10), (b+e+c1) mod 10 = 9 with carry c2 = floor((b+e+c1)/10), and (a+d+c2) mod 10 = 9 with no further carry. From the column sum, 10(a+b+c) + (d+e+f) = 99. Since digits are 0-9, a+b+c ranges 0-27 and d+e+f ranges 0-27. For d+e+f to be non-negative and ≤27, 10(a+b+c) must be between 72 and 99, so a+b+c ∈ {7,8,9}. The carry conditions imply c+f = 9 or 19, b+e+c1 = 9 or 19, and a+d+c2 = 9. This restricts the possible digit pairs significantly. Also, from the example and the derived equations, the digits must satisfy these modular and carry constraints. Therefore, the most consistent digit ranges are: a,b,c,d,e,f ∈ {0,...,9}, with a+b+c ∈ {7,8,9}, c+f ∈ {9,19}, b+e+c1 ∈ {9,19}, a+d+c2 = 9, and carries c1,c2 ∈ {0,1}. These constraints narrow down the feasible digit assignments and are consistent with the problem conditions and example given.; answer - Digits a,b,c,d,e,f are in 0 to 9 with the following constraints: a+b+c ∈ {7,8,9}; c+f = 9 or 19; b+e+c1 = 9 or 19 where c1 = 0 or 1; a+d+c2 = 9 where c2 = 0 or 1; and carries c1,c2 ∈ {0,1}. These ranges and conditions are consistent and narrow down feasible digit assignments.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2_2 output: thinking - We start from the two main sum equations and the carry-based digit addition analysis. The row sums are (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999, and the column sums are (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From the row sums, analyzing digit-wise addition with carries: \n- Units place: c + f = 9 + 10*c1, where c1 is carry (0 or 1). So f = 9 + 10*c1 - c.\n- Tens place: b + e + c1 = 9 + 10*c2, where c2 is carry (0 or 1). So e = 9 + 10*c2 - b - c1.\n- Hundreds place: a + d + c2 = 9 (since sum is 999 and no further carry). So d = 9 - a - c2.\n\nFrom the column sums: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.\nSubstitute d, e, f from above:\n- d + e + f = (9 - a - c2) + (9 + 10*c2 - b - c1) + (9 + 10*c1 - c)\n= 27 - a - b - c + 9*c1 + 9*c2 - c1 - c2\n= 27 - (a + b + c) + 8*c1 + 8*c2\n\nSo column sum equation becomes:\n10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) + 8*c1 + 8*c2 = 99\n9(a + b + c) + 27 + 8(c1 + c2) = 99\n9(a + b + c) + 8(c1 + c2) = 72\n\nSince c1 and c2 are 0 or 1, possible values for c1 + c2 are 0,1,2.\nCheck each:\n- If c1 + c2 = 0, then 9(a + b + c) = 72 => a + b + c = 8\n- If c1 + c2 = 1, then 9(a + b + c) = 64 => no integer solution\n- If c1 + c2 = 2, then 9(a + b + c) = 56 => no integer solution\n\nSo c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, and a + b + c = 8.\n\nTherefore, the explicit relationships are:\n- f = 9 - c\n- e = 9 - b\n- d = 9 - a\n- a + b + c = 8\n- c1 = 0, c2 = 0\n\nThis expresses bottom row digits d, e, f in terms of top row digits a, b, c, and the carry variables c1, c2 are zero. This fully links digits in the same column and across rows, simplifying the problem to choosing digits a,b,c summing to 8, and then computing d,e,f accordingly.; answer - The explicit relationships linking digits in the same column and across rows are: f = 9 - c, e = 9 - b, d = 9 - a, with carry variables c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, and the top row digits satisfy a + b + c = 8. Thus, the bottom row digits are expressed in terms of the top row digits as d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3_1 output: thinking - The problem reduces to finding all digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) where each digit is between 0 and 9, satisfying the two main conditions: the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99. From the digit-wise addition and carry analysis, it is established that there are no carries (c1 = 0, c2 = 0), and the digits in the bottom row are complements to 9 of the top row digits: d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. The sum of the top row digits a + b + c must be 8 to satisfy the total sum of 999. Since a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9 and sum to 8, the number of such triples is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9. This count is given by combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid assignment for (a,b,c,d,e,f).

The verification by multiple agents confirms that these conditions hold exactly for all such triples, with no false positives. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 with digits 0-9 is the number of combinations with repetition allowed, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Let the top row digits be (a,b,c) and the bottom row digits be (d,e,f). The row sum condition is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The column sum condition is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From these, it follows that d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Substituting into the row sum equation, we get a + b + c = 8. Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is the number of combinations with repetition allowed: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Overall, the reasoning is clear, the steps are justified, and the algebraic manipulations are correct. Therefore, the answer is correct.; answer: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent gjoZ, transforming constraints, thinking: We start with the two main equations from the problem: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99, where a,b,c,d,e,f are digits 0-9. To analyze digit-wise modular or carry-based conditions, we consider the addition column by column for the row sums and the column sums separately. For the row sums: adding the units digits c + f must produce a units digit 9 with some carry c1 to the tens place. Similarly, b + e + c1 must produce a tens digit 9 with carry c2 to the hundreds place. Then a + d + c2 must produce a hundreds digit 9 with no further carry (since sum is 999). This gives modular conditions: (c + f) mod 10 = 9, carry c1 = floor((c + f)/10); (b + e + c1) mod 10 = 9, carry c2 = floor((b + e + c1)/10); (a + d + c2) mod 10 = 9, carry c3 = floor((a + d + c2)/10) = 0. For the column sums: sum of (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Grouping tens and units: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. Since digits are 0-9, a + b + c must be between 0 and 27, and d + e + f between 0 and 27. The equation implies d + e + f = 99 - 10(a + b + c). For this to be valid, 99 - 10(a + b + c) must be between 0 and 27, so a + b + c must be 7 or 8 or 9. This modular and carry-based breakdown allows digit-level reasoning and constraints to be applied systematically to find valid digit assignments.; answer: The digit-wise modular and carry-based conditions derived from the row sum (999) are: (c + f) mod 10 = 9 with carry c1 = floor((c + f)/10); (b + e + c1) mod 10 = 9 with carry c2 = floor((b + e + c1)/10); (a + d + c2) mod 10 = 9 with carry c3 = 0. From the column sum (99), the condition is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99, implying d + e + f = 99 - 10(a + b + c).

From the row sums, analyzing digit-wise addition with carries: \n- Units place: c + f = 9 + 10*c1, where c1 is carry (0 or 1). So f = 9 + 10*c1 - c.\n- Tens place: b + e + c1 = 9 + 10*c2, where c2 is carry (0 or 1). So e = 9 + 10*c2 - b - c1.\n- Hundreds place: a + d + c2 = 9 (since sum is 999 and no further carry). So d = 9 - a - c2.\n\nFrom the column sums: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.\nSubstitute d, e, f from above:\n- d + e + f = (9 - a - c2) + (9 + 10*c2 - b - c1) + (9 + 10*c1 - c)\n= 27 - a - b - c + 9*c1 + 9*c2 - c1 - c2\n= 27 - (a + b + c) + 8*c1 + 8*c2\n\nSo column sum equation becomes:\n10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) + 8*c1 + 8*c2 = 99\n9(a + b + c) + 27 + 8(c1 + c2) = 99\n9(a + b + c) + 8(c1 + c2) = 72\n\nSince c1 and c2 are 0 or 1, possible values for c1 + c2 are 0,1,2.\nCheck each:\n- If c1 + c2 = 0, then 9(a + b + c) = 72 => a + b + c = 8\n- If c1 + c2 = 1, then 9(a + b + c) = 64 => no integer solution\n- If c1 + c2 = 2, then 9(a + b + c) = 56 => no integer solution\n\nSo c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, and a + b + c = 8.\n\nTherefore, the explicit relationships are:\n- f = 9 - c\n- e = 9 - b\n- d = 9 - a\n- a + b + c = 8\n- c1 = 0, c2 = 0\n\nThis expresses bottom row digits d, e, f in terms of top row digits a, b, c, and the carry variables c1, c2 are zero.

From the digit-wise addition and carry analysis, it is established that there are no carries (c1 = 0, c2 = 0), and the digits in the bottom row are complements to 9 of the top row digits: d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. The sum of the top row digits a + b + c must be 8 to satisfy the total sum of 999. Since a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9 and sum to 8, the number of such triples is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9. This count is given by combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid assignment for (a,b,c,d,e,f). Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent e4fI, verifying assignments, thinking: To verify each candidate digit assignment, we start from the derived conditions: the bottom row digits are complements to 9 of the top row digits (d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c), and the sum of the top row digits a + b + c = 8. For each triple (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8, the corresponding bottom row digits are uniquely determined. We then check the two sum conditions: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Substituting d, e, f, the first sum simplifies to 999, and the second sum simplifies to 99, confirming both conditions hold exactly for all such assignments. Since the constraints and derivations are mathematically sound and the example given matches this pattern, no false positives exist. Thus, all 45 assignments derived from the combinations of (a,b,c) summing to 8 are valid and satisfy both sum conditions exactly.; answer: All 45 candidate digit assignments where a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9 summing to 8, and d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, satisfy both sum conditions exactly, confirming correctness and eliminating false positives.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent f6co, verifying assignments, thinking: To verify each candidate digit assignment, we start from the established conditions: the digits (a,b,c) in the top row sum to 8, and the bottom row digits (d,e,f) are complements to 9 of the top row digits, i.e., d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c. This ensures the row sums add to 999 and the column sums add to 99 without any carry overs. Since the sum of a+b+c=8 and each digit is between 0 and 9, all such triples are valid. For each triple, the bottom row digits are uniquely determined. Checking the sums for each candidate confirms the conditions hold exactly. This eliminates any false positives because the digit complement relationship and sum constraints are strict and derived from the problem's arithmetic conditions. Therefore, all 45 candidate assignments (solutions to a+b+c=8 with digits 0-9) satisfy both sum conditions exactly, confirming the correctness of the count and the validity of each solution.; answer: All 45 candidate digit assignments, where (a,b,c) are nonnegative integers summing to 8 and (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c), satisfy both sum conditions exactly, confirming the correctness and eliminating false positives.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 0xdv, verifying assignments, thinking: To verify each candidate digit assignment, we start from the derived conditions: the digits in the bottom row are complements to 9 of the top row digits (d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c), and the sum of the top row digits a + b + c = 8. For each triple (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8, the bottom row digits are uniquely determined. We then check the two sum conditions: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Substituting d, e, f, the first sum becomes (100a + 10b + c) + (100(9 - a) + 10(9 - b) + (9 - c)) = 999, which simplifies to 999, confirming the first condition. The second sum becomes (10a + 9 - a) + (10b + 9 - b) + (10c + 9 - c) = (9a + 9) + (9b + 9) + (9c + 9) = 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 9*8 + 27 = 99, confirming the second condition. Since these hold for all such triples, all 45 assignments are valid, and no false positives exist. This verification confirms the correctness of the solution and eliminates any invalid assignments.; answer: All 45 candidate digit assignments satisfy both sum conditions exactly, confirming their correctness and eliminating false positives.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent fiqA, counting valid assignments, thinking: The problem requires counting the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits 0-9 such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Let the top row digits be (a,b,c) and the bottom row digits be (d,e,f). The row sum condition is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The column sum condition is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. From these, it follows that d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Substituting into the row sum equation, we get a + b + c = 8. Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is the number of combinations with repetition allowed: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f), so there are exactly 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions.
