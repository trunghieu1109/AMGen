The problem requires the absolute value of this quantity, so we take the positive value, which is 25/8. Next, we check if the fraction 25/8 is in lowest terms. The numerator 25 factors as 5*5, and the denominator 8 factors as 2*2*2. Since there are no common factors between 25 and 8 other than 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, the relatively prime numerator m is 25 and the denominator n is 8.

This linear system accurately represents the original logarithmic equations and preserves all information needed to find the values of a, b, and c, and subsequently compute the desired expression involving x, y, and z.

Using the logarithm quotient rule, log2(M/N) = log2(M) - log2(N), each equation transforms as follows: log2(x/(yz)) = a - (b + c) = a - b - c = 1/2; similarly, log2(y/(xz)) = b - a - c = 1/3; and log2(z/(xy)) = c - a - b = 1/4.

Substituting the values, we calculate step-by-step: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8, and 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now, summing these: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 24. Convert each term: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Adding: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8. Therefore, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.

We need to find the value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which can be expressed as 4a + 3b + 2c by the properties of logarithms. Substituting the values, we calculate step-by-step: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8, and 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now, summing these: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 24. Convert each term: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Adding: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8. Therefore, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.
