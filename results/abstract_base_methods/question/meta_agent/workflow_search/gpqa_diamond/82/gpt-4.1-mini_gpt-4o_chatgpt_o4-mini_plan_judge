Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_3_82
proposed answer: All agents agree that the calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, which matches choice B. Although the calculated pH at the equivalence point is 9.02, which is higher than the options provided, the closest match is 8.52 in choice B. This discrepancy can be attributed to typical assumptions or calculation deviations, but choice B remains the most consistent with the calculated and expected values. Therefore, choice B is the most appropriate answer.
