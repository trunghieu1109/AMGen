proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are modified in two specific ways: Gauss's law for magnetism changes to include a term for magnetic charge density, and Ampère's law is modified to include a term for magnetic current density. These changes affect both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that mentions changes in both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field, which is choice 2. All the agents agree that choice 2 correctly describes the changes in Maxwell's equations due to magnetic monopoles.

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations are modified. Gauss's law for magnetism changes from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = ρ_m/μ₀, which involves the divergence of the magnetic field. Additionally, Ampère's law is modified to include a magnetic current density term, changing from ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t to ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t + μ₀J_m, which involves the curl of the magnetic field. These modifications align with choice 2, which mentions changes related to both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that captures these specific changes.
