Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which mutant line most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to consider the impact of each mutation on the gene's function. Mutant 4 has a deletion starting from the 13th position, leading to a frameshift mutation. Frameshift mutations are known to significantly disrupt protein function by altering the reading frame, leading to a completely different sequence of amino acids and potentially introducing a premature stop codon. This would result in a truncated and likely non-functional protein. A non-functional protein in this context is likely to abolish the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound, as the protein responsible for its synthesis would be disrupted. Other mutants (1, 2, and 3) involve point mutations that may lead to missense mutations, which only change one amino acid and are less likely to cause a complete loss of function. Therefore, Mutant 4 is the most probable candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by causing a loss of function of the protein responsible for its synthesis.

proposed answer: All agents agree that Mutant 2 introduces a nonsense mutation early in the sequence, which results in a premature stop codon. This leads to the production of a truncated protein that is likely non-functional. The presence of a premature stop codon can trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), reducing the mRNA levels and preventing the synthesis of the full-length protein. This is expected to abolish the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound, as the protein responsible for its production would not be produced. The other mutants involve missense mutations or small deletions, which are less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate for eliminating the compound synthesis due to the impact of the nonsense mutation.
