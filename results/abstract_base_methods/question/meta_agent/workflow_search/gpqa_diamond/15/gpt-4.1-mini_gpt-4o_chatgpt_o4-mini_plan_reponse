A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center and no plane of symmetry. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound has a double bond with Z configuration, but no chiral centers, so it is not optically active.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers at 3a and 7a, and no plane of symmetry, so it is optically active.\n\n3.

(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers and is not a meso compound, so it is optically active.\n\n5.
