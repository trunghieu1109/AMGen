Question: Example(question='How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one', choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_15
proposed answer: All agents agree that the compounds (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol are optically active. These compounds have chiral centers and do not have internal planes of symmetry, which makes them optically active. The total number of optically active compounds is 3, which corresponds to choice A) in the multiple-choice options.
