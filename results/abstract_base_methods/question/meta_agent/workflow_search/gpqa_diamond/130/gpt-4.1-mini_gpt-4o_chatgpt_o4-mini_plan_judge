This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product).

proposed answer: The NOESY NMR spectrum is used to identify protons that are close in space. In the context of the major product, which is expected to have endo stereochemistry, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum indicates proximity between protons. The major product's 1H NMR spectrum shows a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, which are likely to be close in space due to the endo orientation. This is supported by the choice from Sub-task 4, where the cross-peak was identified between these resonances. Therefore, the correct choice for the proton resonances connected by the NOESY cross-peak in the major product is a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

proposed answer: The NOESY cross-peak assignment was based on the spatial proximity of protons in the endo adduct of the Diels-Alder reaction. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm corresponds to the methyl groups, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons. In the endo configuration, these groups are close enough to show a NOESY correlation. Alternative assignments, such as the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm or the 6H singlet at ~1 ppm, do not have the same spatial proximity to the methylene protons, making them less likely to show a strong NOESY cross-peak. The stereochemistry of the endo product supports the observed NOESY correlation, confirming the assignment. The critical evaluation confirms that the spatial proximity in the endo configuration is consistent with the observed NOESY cross-peak, and alternative assignments do not fit the spatial requirements for a strong NOESY correlation.

Answer:The observed cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum corresponds to the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.
