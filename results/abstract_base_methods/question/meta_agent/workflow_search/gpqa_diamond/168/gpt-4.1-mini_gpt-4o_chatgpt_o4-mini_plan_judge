Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous due to the presence of two neutrinos (V) that can carry away varying amounts of energy. This variability results in a continuous distribution of energy among the E particles. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, where one massless particle M replaces the two neutrinos, the energy spectrum remains continuous. This is because the energy can still be distributed in various ways between the E particles and the massless particle M. Additionally, since M is massless and only one particle, it carries away less energy compared to two neutrinos. Consequently, more energy is available for the E particles, potentially increasing their maximum energy or endpoint. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. This corresponds to choice C).
