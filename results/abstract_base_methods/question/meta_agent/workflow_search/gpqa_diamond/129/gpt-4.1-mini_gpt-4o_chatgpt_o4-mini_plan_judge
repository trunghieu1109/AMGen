Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_129
proposed answer: The calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.467. The task is to find the closest lower limit redshift from the given options: 1.9, 2.4, 3, and 1.2. A lower limit means the value should be less than or equal to the calculated redshift. Among the options, 1.2 is the only value that is less than 1.467, making it the closest lower limit. Although 1.9 is numerically closer to 1.467, it is not a lower limit because it is greater than 1.467. Therefore, the correct choice for the closest lower limit is 1.2.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_129
proposed answer: The task involves verifying the consistency and correctness of the assumptions and results regarding the detection of Lyman alpha absorption by ground-based optical telescopes. The key assumptions are the Lyman alpha rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms and the practical instrument sensitivity cutoff wavelength of 3500 Angstroms for ground-based telescopes. The redshift z is calculated using the formula: (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. Substituting the values, we get z = (3500 / 1216) - 1 â‰ˆ 1.877. The closest multiple-choice option that is greater than or equal to this calculated redshift is 1.9. This choice aligns with the practical constraints of ground-based optical observations, as telescopes are typically sensitive to wavelengths starting from around 3500 Angstroms. Therefore, the choice of 1.9 as the lower limit on the redshift is consistent with the known observational constraints and has physical meaning, as it represents the minimum redshift at which the Lyman alpha absorption can be detected by these telescopes. The assumptions and final answer are consistent and physically correct, as the calculation of the redshift using the formula (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1 is appropriate for determining the redshift at which Lyman alpha absorption can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes. The choice of 3500 Angstroms as the cutoff wavelength is reasonable, as it represents the lower limit of sensitivity for many optical telescopes. The calculated redshift of approximately 1.877 is rounded to 1.9, which is the closest option provided in the multiple-choice answers. This choice is consistent with the practical constraints of ground-based optical observations and aligns with the known sensitivity limits of such telescopes.

Answer:The chosen wavelength cutoff of 3500 Angstroms and the final redshift answer of 1.9 align with known observational constraints and physical meaning, as they represent the practical limits for detecting Lyman alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes.
