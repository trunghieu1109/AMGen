The positions are ortho, meta, and para, respectively, relative to each other. To synthesize this molecule from benzene, we need to add these groups in a sequence that maximizes yield and minimizes side reactions. The tert-butyl group is a bulky group that directs further substitutions to the para position due to steric hindrance.

The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para-director due to its electron-donating nature through hyperconjugation. The ethoxy group, being an ether, is also an ortho/para-director because of its electron-donating resonance effect. The nitro group is a meta-director due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature.

This order takes advantage of the directing effects of the tert-butyl group, which is ortho/para-directing, to ensure the nitro group is placed at the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group. The ethoxy group is then introduced via ether formation. Choice 1 (option A) aligns with this logical sequence: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 for tert-butylation, ii) HNO3/H2SO4 for nitration, and vii) NaOH/EtBr for ethoxylation. This sequence is chemically feasible and should lead to the target molecule efficiently.; answer: A', iteration_idx=-1)]
