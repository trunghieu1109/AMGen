Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_163
proposed answer: The computed mass ratio factor from Sub-task 5 is approximately 0.7. The given multiple-choice options are: 'choice1': '~ 0.4', 'choice2': '~ 0.7', 'choice3': '~ 0.6', 'choice4': '~ 1.2'. The closest match to the computed factor of 0.7 is 'choice2': '~ 0.7'. Therefore, the corresponding letter choice is B. This choice is confirmed by the feedback from Critic Agent zn8v, which states that the choice matching is correct and complete.
