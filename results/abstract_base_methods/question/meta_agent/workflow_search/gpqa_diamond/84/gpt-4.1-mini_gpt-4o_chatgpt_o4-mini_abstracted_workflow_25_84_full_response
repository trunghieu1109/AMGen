Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks="Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The observed Doppler wavelength shifts (Δλ) in the forbidden [OI] line at 6300 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 correspond to the star's reflex radial velocities because the radial velocity method measures the motion of the star due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planets. When a planet orbits a star, it exerts a gravitational force on the star, causing the star to move in a small orbit around the center of mass of the star-planet system. This motion of the star causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, which is what is observed as the Δλ. The shifts are not due to the planets' orbital velocities because the planets themselves do not emit light that we can measure; instead, we observe the effect of their gravitational pull on the star's motion. The periodic nature of the shifts corresponds to the orbital period of the planets, and the magnitude of the shifts is related to the mass of the planets and their distance from the star.; answer - The observed Doppler wavelength shifts correspond to the star's reflex radial velocities induced by each planet because the radial velocity method measures the motion of the star due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planets, not the planets' orbital velocities.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The original question does not provide explicit orbital periods for Planet1 and Planet2, nor does it give specific transit data such as the duration or depth of the transit.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit, with the proportionality constant depending on the mass of the star. The formula is P^2 = (4π^2/GM_star) * a^3, where G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star. For a star with mass 1.5 times that of the Sun, we would adjust the formula accordingly. However, since the orbital periods were not provided in Sub-task 2, we cannot proceed with the calculation. We need the orbital periods to determine the semi-major axes accurately. Without this information, we cannot ensure the physical plausibility of the results.

For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature can be approximated by the formula T_eq ∝ T_star × sqrt(R_star / (2 × d)), where T_star is the effective temperature of the star, R_star is the radius of the star, and d is the orbital radius of the planet. This formula assumes that the planet is a perfect blackbody and that it has a uniform albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo and are in circular orbits, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is given by T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(d2 / d1), where d1 and d2 are the orbital radii of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. This is because the stellar temperature and radius are the same for both planets, and the albedo is identical, so these factors cancel out in the ratio.; answer - T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(d2 / d1)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is determined by the formula T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(d2 / d1), where d1 and d2 are the orbital radii of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively.

The transit method typically allows us to measure the period by observing the time between successive transits.

The transit method can provide the orbital period by measuring the time between successive transits of the planet across the star.

However, the original question and sub-task 2 indicate that these periods are not provided and need to be requested or estimated using additional data. Without the orbital periods, we cannot directly apply Kepler's third law, which relates the period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Kepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = (4π^2)/(G(M_star + M_planet)), where P is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and M_star and M_planet are the masses of the star and planet, respectively. Since M_planet is negligible compared to M_star, we can simplify this to P^2 = (4π^2/G(M_star))a^3. Without P, we cannot solve for a.

Since the masses of the planets are much smaller than the mass of the star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. However, without the periods, we cannot solve for the semi-major axes.
