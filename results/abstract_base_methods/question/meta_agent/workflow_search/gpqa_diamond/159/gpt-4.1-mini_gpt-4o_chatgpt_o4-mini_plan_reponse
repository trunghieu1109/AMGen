        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - As the number of sides N of the polygon increases to infinity, the shape of the polygon becomes closer to that of a circle. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N becomes very large, the apothem effectively becomes the radius of the circle that the polygon approximates. Therefore, when N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon with equal apothems of length a effectively becomes a circular aperture with radius a. This is because the more sides a polygon has, the more it resembles a circle, and the apothem, which is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side, becomes the radius of the circle in the limit as N approaches infinity.; answer - As N \u2192 \u221e, the polygon approaches a circular aperture with radius a.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - For a circular aperture of diameter D, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk pattern.

These values are derived from the properties of the Bessel function J\u2081(u). In the context of a circular aperture diffraction pattern, these zeros indicate the angles at which the intensity is zero, i.e., the minima.
