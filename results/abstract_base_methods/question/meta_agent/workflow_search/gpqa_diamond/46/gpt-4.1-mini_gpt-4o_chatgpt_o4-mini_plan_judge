Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_46
proposed answer: The IR data shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be part of an ester or an amide. The 1H NMR data provides further insights: a triplet at 1.20 ppm and a quartet at 4.5 ppm are consistent with an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm suggests an NH2 group, and doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm indicate aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the given options, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (D) fits these observations: it has an ester linkage (ethyl group attached to a carbonyl) and an amine group (NH2) on the para position of the benzene ring, which matches the IR and NMR data. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is also consistent with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The other options either have different functional groups or substitution patterns that do not fit the spectral data. Therefore, the best match is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
