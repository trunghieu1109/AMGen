Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_86
proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, likely 4-chloroacetophenone. The 1H NMR spectrum for this compound should show two doublets for the aromatic protons due to the para-substitution pattern, each integrating to 2 protons, with chemical shifts typically between 7-8 ppm. Additionally, there should be a singlet for the methyl protons of the acetyl group, integrating to 3 protons, typically around 2-3 ppm. Among the provided choices, option D) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s) matches this expected pattern, with two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group, aligning with the expected chemical shifts and integrations. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
