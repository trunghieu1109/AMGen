        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons, which is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus X is the lithium isotope with atomic number Z = 3 and mass number A = 6.; answer - The atomic number (Z) is 3 and the mass number (A) is 6.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The nucleus X is lithium-6, with an atomic number Z = 3 and mass number A = 6. The rest mass energy of a nucleus can be approximated by considering the rest mass of its nucleons and any binding energy. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Therefore, the total rest mass energy of the nucleus is approximately 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. This is a rough approximation, as it doesn't account for the binding energy, which would slightly reduce the total rest mass energy. However, the binding energy per nucleon for light nuclei like lithium-6 is relatively small, so the approximation is reasonable.; answer - The rest mass energy of the nucleus X is approximately 5.628 GeV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The relativistic gamma factor (\u03b3) is calculated using the formula \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light. Given that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, we substitute v = 0.96c into the formula. This gives us \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Calculating this, we have \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714. Therefore, the relativistic gamma factor is approximately 3.5714.; answer - 3.5714\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To find the total relativistic energy of the nucleus X, we need to multiply the rest mass energy by the relativistic gamma factor. From sub-task 2, we know the rest mass energy of the nucleus X is approximately 5.628 GeV. From sub-task 3, the relativistic gamma factor (\u03b3) is approximately 3.5714. The total relativistic energy E is given by the formula E = \u03b3 * E_rest. Substituting the values, we get E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Performing the multiplication, we have E = 20.1086 GeV. Rounding this to the precision of 1e-4, the total relativistic energy of the nucleus X is approximately 20.1086 GeV.; answer - 20.1086 GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The computed total relativistic energy of the nucleus X is 20.1086 GeV. We need to compare this value with the provided multiple-choice options: 18.475 GeV, 20.132 GeV, 23.069 GeV, and 21.419 GeV. The goal is to find the closest match within the required precision of 1e-4. The computed energy, 20.1086 GeV, is closest to the option 20.132 GeV.
