Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_135
proposed answer: The computed integral value of the divergence of the vector field inside the sphere is 4π, as determined by applying the Divergence Theorem. This value matches the choice labeled 'choice2', which is '4 π'. The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface of the sphere, and the flux is 4π due to the singularity at the origin. Therefore, the most appropriate answer from the given multiple-choice options is 'choice2'.
