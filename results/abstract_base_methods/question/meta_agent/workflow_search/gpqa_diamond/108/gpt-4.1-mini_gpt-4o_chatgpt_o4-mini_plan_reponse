        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The initial NN bound state is given as 1S0. In the term symbol (2S+1)L(J), 1S0 indicates the following: The '1' in front of 'S' means 2S+1 = 1, so S = 0. The 'S' indicates that the orbital angular momentum L = 0 (since S corresponds to L = 0 in spectroscopic notation). The '0' after 'S' indicates the total angular momentum J = 0. For nucleons, the isospin T is typically 1 for a neutron-proton pair in a singlet state, but since the problem states T(NN) = 0 for the final state, we assume the initial state also has T = 0. Therefore, the initial state has S = 0, L = 0, J = 0, and T = 0.; answer - The initial NN bound state (1S0) has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, total angular momentum J = 0, and isospin T = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The initial state has L = 0, so its parity is (-1)^L = (+1). The parity of the final state must be the product of the parities of the NN state and the emitted particle X. If the final NN state has orbital angular momentum L(NN), its parity is (-1)^(L(NN)). Therefore, the parity conservation condition is: (+1) = (-1)^(L(NN)) * (-1). Simplifying, we get (-1)^(L(NN)) = -1, which means L(NN) must be odd. So the final NN state must have an odd orbital angular momentum to conserve parity.; answer - The final NN state must have an odd orbital angular momentum to conserve parity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The Pauli statistics constraint given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). This means that the sum of the spin S(NN), the orbital angular momentum L(NN), and 1 must be congruent to the isospin T(NN) modulo 2. For the final NN state, we are given that T(NN) = 0. Therefore, we have the equation 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Simplifying this, we get S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 2), which implies S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 -1 \u2261 1 (mod 2). Thus, S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. This constraint must be satisfied by the final NN state after the emission of the particle X.; answer - The Pauli statistics constraint T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) implies that for T(NN) = 0, S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To extract the quantum numbers S, L, J, and T from the term symbols and the angular momentum state of the emitted particle X, we need to analyze each choice:\n\n1) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s: The initial state 1S0 has S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state 3P0 has S=1, L=1, J=0. The emitted particle X is in an s-wave, which means it has l=0.\n\n2) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: The initial state 1S0 has S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state 7D1 has S=3, L=2, J=1. The emitted particle X is in a p-wave, which means it has l=1.\n\n3) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f: The initial state 1S0 has S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state 3D3 has S=1, L=2, J=3. The emitted particle X is in an f-wave, which means it has l=3.\n\n4) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p: The initial state 1S0 has S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state 3S1 has S=1, L=0, J=1. The emitted particle X is in a p-wave, which means it has l=1.\n\nFor each final NN state, we need to check if S(NN) + L(NN) is odd, as required by the Pauli statistics constraint for T(NN) = 0.\n\n- For 3P0: S=1, L=1, so S+L=2 (even).\n- For 7D1: S=3, L=2, so S+L=5 (odd).\n- For 3D3: S=1, L=2, so S+L=3 (odd).\n- For 3S1: S=1, L=0, so S+L=1 (odd).\n\nThe choice that does not satisfy the constraint (S+L must be odd) is 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, because S+L=2 is even.; answer - 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The Pauli statistics condition requires that for a final NN state with T(NN) = 0, the sum S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even. This is because T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) implies that S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd for T(NN) = 0. Analyzing each option: \n\n1) For 1S0 -> 3P0 + s: S=1, L=1, so S+L=2, which is even. Therefore, S+L+1=3, which is odd, not satisfying the condition.\n\n2) For 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: S=3, L=2, so S+L=5, which is odd. Therefore, S+L+1=6, which is even, satisfying the condition.\n\n3) For 1S0 -> 3D3 + f: S=1, L=2, so S+L=3, which is odd. Therefore, S+L+1=4, which is even, satisfying the condition.\n\n4) For 1S0 -> 3S1 + p: S=1, L=0, so S+L=1, which is odd. Therefore, S+L+1=2, which is even, satisfying the condition.\n\nThe only option that does not satisfy the Pauli statistics condition is 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, as S+L+1 is odd, whereas it should be even for T(NN) = 0.; answer - 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The task is to verify which of the given transitions do not satisfy the conservation of total angular momentum. The initial state 1S0 has J=0. For each transition, we need to check if the vector sum of the final NN state's J and the angular momentum of the emitted particle X can result in J=0. \n\n1) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s: The final state 3P0 has J=0 and the emitted particle X in an s-wave has l=0. The total angular momentum is 0+0=0, which matches the initial J=0.\n\n2) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: The final state 7D1 has J=1 and the emitted particle X in a p-wave has l=1. The possible total angular momentum values are 0, 1, or 2. However, the initial J=0 does not match any of these values, as the vector sum cannot be 0.\n\n3) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f: The final state 3D3 has J=3 and the emitted particle X in an f-wave has l=3. The possible total angular momentum values include 0, which matches the initial J=0.\n\n4) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p: The final state 3S1 has J=1 and the emitted particle X in a p-wave has l=1. The possible total angular momentum values include 0, which matches the initial J=0.\n\nTherefore, the transition 1S0 -> 7D1 + p does not satisfy the conservation of total angular momentum because the vector sum cannot result in J=0.; answer - 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The initial state 1S0 has parity (+1) because it has L=0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity (-1). For parity conservation, the parity of the final state must equal the product of the initial state parity and the intrinsic parity of X. Therefore, the parity of the final state must be (-1). The parity of the final NN state is given by (-1)^(L(NN)), where L(NN) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. For each choice:\n\n1) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s: L(NN) = 1, so parity = (-1)^1 = -1. Matches parity conservation.\n2) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: L(NN) = 2, so parity = (-1)^2 = +1. Does not match parity conservation.\n3) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f: L(NN) = 2, so parity = (-1)^2 = +1. Does not match parity conservation.\n4) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p: L(NN) = 0, so parity = (-1)^0 = +1. Does not match parity conservation.\n\nOnly the first choice, 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, satisfies parity conservation, as it results in a final parity of -1, which matches the required parity for the final state.; answer - 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - To determine which final NN partial wave(s) are forbidden, we need to consider the results from Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, and parity conservation. \n\n1) From Sub-task 5 (Pauli statistics), the transition 1S0 -> 3P0 + s is not permitted because it does not satisfy the condition S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even for T(NN) = 0.\n\n2) From Sub-task 6 (angular momentum conservation), the transition 1S0 -> 7D1 + p is not permitted because the vector sum of the final NN state's J and the angular momentum of the emitted particle X cannot result in J=0.\n\n3) From Sub-task 7 (parity conservation), the transitions 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, 1S0 -> 3D3 + f, and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p do not satisfy parity conservation because their final parities do not match the required parity of -1.\n\nCombining these results, the transition 1S0 -> 7D1 + p is forbidden by both angular momentum conservation and parity conservation. The transition 1S0 -> 3P0 + s is forbidden by Pauli statistics. The transitions 1S0 -> 3D3 + f and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p are forbidden by parity conservation.\n\nTherefore, the forbidden transitions are 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, 1S0 -> 3D3 + f, and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p.; answer - 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, 1S0 -> 3D3 + f, 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 9 output: thinking - Based on the analysis from Sub-task 8, all the given transitions are forbidden due to violations of Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, or parity conservation. Specifically, the transition 1S0 -> 3P0 + s is forbidden by Pauli statistics, 1S0 -> 7D1 + p is forbidden by both angular momentum and parity conservation, and 1S0 -> 3D3 + f and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p are forbidden by parity conservation. Therefore, all choices A, B, C, and D correspond to forbidden partial waves.; answer - A), B), C), D)"
