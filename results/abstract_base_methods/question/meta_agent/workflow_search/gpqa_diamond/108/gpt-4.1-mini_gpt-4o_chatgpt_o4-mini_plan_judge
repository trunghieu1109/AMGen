Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_108
proposed answer: Based on the analysis from Sub-task 8, all the given transitions are forbidden due to violations of Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, or parity conservation. Specifically, the transition 1S0 -> 3P0 + s is forbidden by Pauli statistics, 1S0 -> 7D1 + p is forbidden by both angular momentum and parity conservation, and 1S0 -> 3D3 + f and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p are forbidden by parity conservation. Therefore, all choices A, B, C, and D correspond to forbidden partial waves.
