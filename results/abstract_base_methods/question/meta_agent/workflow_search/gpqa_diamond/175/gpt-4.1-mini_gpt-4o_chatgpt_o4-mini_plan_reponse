The norm is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the components: sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). Thus, the normalized state vector is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)). This normalized vector is used for quantum probability calculations because it ensures the total probability is 1.; answer - (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - All agents agree on the construction of the operator matrices P and Q based on the given elements.

The matrix P is given as [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. Calculating the determinant of P - \u03bbI, we find the eigenvalues. After finding the eigenvalues, we solve (P - \u03bbI)v = 0 for each eigenvalue \u03bb to find the corresponding eigenvectors. We then normalize these eigenvectors. For the eigenvalue 0, we identify the corresponding eigenstate by solving (P - 0I)v = 0, which simplifies to Pv = 0. Solving this system gives us the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. We then normalize this eigenvector to get the normalized eigenstate for eigenvalue 0.; answer - The eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

This gives the eigenvalues \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = 0, and \u03bb = -1. For each eigenvalue, we find the corresponding eigenvectors. For \u03bb = -1, we solve (Q + I)v = 0, which gives the system of equations: [0, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0]v = 0. This implies v = [0, 1, 0] is an eigenvector for \u03bb = -1.
