Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Based on the outputs from the sub-tasks, the most likely cause of the failure to overexpress the protein is the presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the sequence, which leads to early termination of translation. Sub-task 3 confirmed that the HA tag sequence is correct with no missense mutations, ruling out sequence deviations in the HA tag as the cause. Sub-task 4 identified the premature stop codon 'TGA' as causing early termination of translation, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. Sub-task 5 considered the lack of a linker sequence, which could lead to proteolytic degradation, but this would not prevent initial overexpression, only affect stability. Sub-task 6 confirmed that stop codons are recognized by release factors in the mouse system, and no tRNA exists for them, supporting the conclusion that the premature stop codon is the issue. Therefore, the premature stop codon is the most likely reason for the failure to overexpress the protein.

Answer:The premature stop codon 'TGA' causes early termination of translation, preventing full-length protein synthesis, explaining the failure to overexpress the protein.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_74
proposed answer: The integration of evidence from all prior subtasks consistently points to the absence of a linker sequence between the HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence as the most likely cause of the failure to overexpress the protein. The sequence annotation and translation accuracy confirmed that the HA tag sequence is correctly translated without any missense mutations, ruling out sequence errors. The biological validation confirmed that the stop codon is properly recognized in the mouse translation system, eliminating translation termination issues. However, the absence of a linker sequence is significant because linkers are typically used to provide flexibility and prevent steric hindrance or proteolytic degradation. Without a linker, the nascent protein may be more susceptible to proteolytic degradation, impacting its stability and expression levels. This is supported by the conclusion that the lack of a linker is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. While other factors such as plasmid integration, promoter activity, or mRNA stability could also affect protein expression, the evidence strongly suggests that the absence of a linker is the most likely cause of the observed failure to overexpress the protein.
