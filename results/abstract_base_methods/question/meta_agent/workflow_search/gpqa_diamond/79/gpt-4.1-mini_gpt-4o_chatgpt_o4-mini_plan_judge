Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_79
proposed answer: The previous analysis concluded that the transformation rules for converting DNA sequences into numeric outputs could not be determined from the given examples. Without a clear pattern or formula, it is impossible to compute the numeric output for ACAGTGACC accurately. Therefore, any choice among the provided options (333, 315, 351, 185) would be purely speculative. Since the task requires selecting a choice despite the lack of information, I must acknowledge that the selection is arbitrary. However, given the lack of a valid computation method, I cannot justify any choice as correct.
