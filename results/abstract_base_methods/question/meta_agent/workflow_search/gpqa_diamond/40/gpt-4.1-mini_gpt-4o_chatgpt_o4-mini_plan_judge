Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_40
proposed answer: The simplified expression from subtask_4 is (1+n*v)/(n+v). We need to compare this expression with the provided multiple-choice options. Choice1 is (1+n*v)/(n-v), which does not match the expression because the denominator is different. Choice2 is (1-n*v)/(n+v), which does not match because the numerator is different. Choice3 is (1+n*v)/(n+v), which exactly matches our derived expression. Choice4 is 1, which does not match either. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the simplified expression is choice3.
