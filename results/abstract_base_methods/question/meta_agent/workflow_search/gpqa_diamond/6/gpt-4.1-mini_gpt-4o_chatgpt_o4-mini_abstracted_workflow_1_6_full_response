This is a well-known process in high-energy astrophysics where gamma-ray photons can interact with lower energy photons, such as those from the CMB, to produce particle-antiparticle pairs if the energy conditions are right. The reaction is represented as gamma gamma -> e+ e-, where two photons (gamma) interact to produce an electron (e-) and a positron (e+).
