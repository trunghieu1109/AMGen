The 'pause' refers to the SRP binding to the signal sequence of the nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome, which temporarily halts translation.

The SRP binds to the nascent polypeptide chain as it emerges from the ribosome in the cytosol, pausing translation and targeting the complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This is consistent with the process of co-translational translocation for secretory and membrane proteins.
