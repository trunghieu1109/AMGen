Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: All debate agents agree that the most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The NMR data shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, indicating two different chemical environments, which is consistent with diastereoisomers. The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with identical mass spectra, indicating two species with the same molecular weight. Enantiomers would not show different NMR peaks for the same proton in a non-chiral environment and typically do not separate in LC-MS without a chiral column. Contamination or reaction side-products would likely show different mass spectra or integrals, which is not observed here. Therefore, the presence of diastereoisomers is the most plausible explanation, as it accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations while maintaining the same molecular weight for the species involved.

proposed answer: The structured debate among the agents consistently supports the hypothesis that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This conclusion is based on the evidence from both the 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses. The presence of two peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals in the NMR spectrum, along with two peaks of equal intensities in the LC-MS at elevated temperatures, suggests the presence of two distinct species with the same molecular weight. Diastereomers, which are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, can have different chemical shifts and retention times, making them a plausible explanation for the observed data. Enantiomers can be ruled out because they do not cause duplicated NMR peaks in an achiral environment. Rotamers, while they could cause duplicated NMR peaks, are less likely to show equal intensity peaks in LC-MS at elevated temperatures due to potential interconversion. Other causes like contamination or side-products would likely result in different masses or peak intensities, which are not observed. Therefore, the most chemically consistent and likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
