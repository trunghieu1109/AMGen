Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_41
proposed answer: The calculated orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1 is approximately 33.4, as determined by applying Kepler's third law. This value is compared with the provided multiple-choice options: ~ 4.4, ~ 33.4, ~ 10.4, and ~ 3.2. Among these options, ~ 33.4 is the closest match to the calculated result. All agents agree that choice2, which is ~ 33.4, is the correct option. Therefore, the final decision on the closest matching orbital period ratio factor is choice2.
