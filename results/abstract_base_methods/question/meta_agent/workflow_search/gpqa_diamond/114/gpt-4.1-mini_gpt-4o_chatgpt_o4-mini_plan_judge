Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_114
proposed answer: The calculated angle between the directions of the photons is 138 degrees. This matches the third multiple-choice option provided, which is 138Â°. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C).
