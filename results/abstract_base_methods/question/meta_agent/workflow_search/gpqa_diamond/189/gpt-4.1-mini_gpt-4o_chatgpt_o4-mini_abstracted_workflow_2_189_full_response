In aqueous solutions, negatively charged species are generally more nucleophilic than neutral ones. Additionally, less electronegative atoms tend to be better nucleophiles because they hold onto their electrons less tightly. Steric hindrance can also affect nucleophilicity, with bulkier groups being less nucleophilic. Finally, in polar protic solvents like water, larger atoms are better nucleophiles due to their ability to better stabilize the solvation shell. \n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion, which is negatively charged and a strong nucleophile. However, it is somewhat hindered due to the cyclohexane ring.\n2. Hydroxide (OH-): This is a small, negatively charged ion and a very strong nucleophile in aqueous solution.\n3.

Charged species, particularly negatively charged ions, are generally more nucleophilic than neutral molecules because they have extra electron density to donate. Electronegativity plays a role because atoms that are less electronegative hold onto their electrons less tightly and are thus more willing to donate them, making them better nucleophiles. Solvation effects are significant in polar protic solvents like water, where larger, less electronegative atoms can be better nucleophiles because they are less tightly solvated and can more easily approach the electrophile. Steric hindrance affects nucleophilicity because bulkier nucleophiles have a harder time accessing the electrophile, reducing their reactivity.
