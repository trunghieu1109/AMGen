Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_151
proposed answer: The analysis from Sub-task 5 concluded that the pre-replication complex is least likely to be observed in the ChIP-MS assay of active chromatin in the shmoo. This is because the pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, not transcription, and is not typically associated with active chromatin regions during transcriptional activation. The other complexes, such as the pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex, are involved in transcription and are more likely to be present in active chromatin. Therefore, the correct answer choice corresponding to the protein complex least observed in the assay is 'pre-replication complex', which is choice B).
