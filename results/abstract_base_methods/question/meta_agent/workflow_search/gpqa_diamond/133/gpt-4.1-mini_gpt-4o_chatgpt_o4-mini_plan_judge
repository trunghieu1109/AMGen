Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_133
proposed answer: The calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -11.46 kJ, which converts to approximately -2.74 kcal using the conversion factor 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal. Among the given multiple-choice options, the closest value to -2.74 kcal is '-2.72 kcal'. Therefore, the correct answer choice is A) -2.72 kcal, as it is the closest match to the calculated value.
