The molarity of HCl is 0.2 M and the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Therefore, the moles of HCl = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, contributing 0.1 moles of H+ ions.; answer - The moles of HCl present are 0.1 moles, contributing 0.1 moles of H+ ions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the moles of H2SO4, we use the formula: moles = molarity × volume (in liters). The molarity of H2SO4 is 0.3 M and the volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, it dissociates to release 2 moles of H+ ions per mole of H2SO4. Therefore, the total moles of H+ ions contributed by H2SO4 = 0.09 moles × 2 = 0.18 moles.; answer - The moles of H2SO4 present are 0.09 moles, contributing 0.18 moles of H+ ions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the moles of Ba(OH)2, we use the formula: moles = molarity * volume (in liters).

From the previous sub-tasks, we have calculated that the total moles of H+ ions from HCl and H2SO4 are 0.1 moles + 0.18 moles = 0.28 moles. The total moles of OH- ions from Ba(OH)2 are 0.2 moles. In a neutralization reaction, H+ ions react with OH- ions to form water (H2O). The reaction is: H+ + OH- -> H2O. Since we have 0.28 moles of H+ ions and 0.2 moles of OH- ions, the OH- ions are the limiting reactant because there are fewer moles of OH- ions than H+ ions.
