Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_11
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and neutrino as 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. These values match exactly with the multiple-choice option 'choice4': '4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV'. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculations and the options provided is choice 4. All agents agree on this conclusion, confirming the consistency and correctness of the result.
