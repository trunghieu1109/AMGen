Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_69
proposed answer: All agents agree that the molecular symmetry group of product E is C2v. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the complex Fe(NH3)2Cl3, which suggests a distorted geometry with a principal C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes, consistent with the C2v point group. The options provided are C2, C2v, D4h, and D∞h. Since the determined symmetry group is C2v, the correct choice among the given options is C2v.
