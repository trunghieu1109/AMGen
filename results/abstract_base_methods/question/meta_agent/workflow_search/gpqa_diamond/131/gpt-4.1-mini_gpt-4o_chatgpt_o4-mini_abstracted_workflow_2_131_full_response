This is calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2, where C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, H is the number of hydrogens, and X is the number of halogens. For C10H14, the degree of unsaturation is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 5.

The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at positions 2 and 5 are equivalent. Thus, there are two singlets for the methyl protons. The chemical shift for aromatic methyl groups is typically around 2.0-2.3 ppm. The integration ratio for the two singlets would be 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\n2. 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene: This compound has four distinct methyl groups due to its lack of symmetry (Cs point group). Each methyl group is in a different environment, leading to four singlets. The chemical shifts would be in the range of 2.0-2.3 ppm, but they would not be equivalent.
