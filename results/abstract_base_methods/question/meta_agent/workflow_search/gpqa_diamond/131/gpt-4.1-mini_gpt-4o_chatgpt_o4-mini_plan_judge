Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: The observed 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating two compounds each with two equivalent aromatic protons. This matches the aromatic signals of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, both of which have two aromatic protons that appear as singlets at this chemical shift. The aliphatic region shows three singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups, resulting in two singlets, while 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene also has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups, resulting in two singlets. The combination of these two compounds can account for the three singlets observed in the aliphatic region, as the overlapping signals from both compounds can result in the observed integration pattern. Other options, such as 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene, do not fit the observed aromatic and aliphatic signals. Therefore, the compounds that best fit the observed spectrum are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

proposed answer: The observed 1H NMR spectrum shows two aromatic singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The pair 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene fits these observations well. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is symmetric, leading to one aromatic singlet and two aliphatic singlets, which matches the observed 1:1 ratio for the aromatic region. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene offers two distinct aromatic protons, contributing two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, and multiple aliphatic singlets that can combine with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's aliphatic singlets to yield the observed 2:1:1 ratio. Other options either do not provide the correct number of signals or fail to match the integration ratios. For instance, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would lead to more complex aromatic signals due to less symmetry, and 1,4-diethylbenzene would not provide the correct aliphatic split pattern. Therefore, the pair 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly aligns with the observed NMR data, considering both aromatic and aliphatic regions.
