proposed answer: The sub-task requires expressing the allowed two-step transition routes and their probabilities in LaTeX format. Based on the provided sub-task answers, the allowed transitions from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> are: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> with a probability of 1/3, and |3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0> and |3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0> each with a probability of 1/4. These probabilities are determined by the selection rules for dipole transitions and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The LaTeX format should match the style of the provided choices in the original question. The final decision on the LaTeX formatted two-step transition routes and probabilities is: |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{3}, |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{4}, |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,-1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{4}.

Answer:|3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{3}, |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{4}, |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,-1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{4}.
Extracted answer: |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{3}, |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{4}, |3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,-1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle \text{ with probability } \frac{1}{4}.

proposed answer: The derived transition routes and probabilities are: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/2, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/4, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/4. Comparing these with the multiple-choice options: Choice 1 has a route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4, which matches one of the derived routes. Choice 2 has a route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3, which does not match the derived probability of 1/2. Choice 3 has a route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4, which matches one of the derived routes. Choice 4 is incomplete and does not match any derived route. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the derived results exactly is Choice 1.
