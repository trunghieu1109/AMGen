Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_52
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that the NMR and FTIR data are consistent with the molecular formula C12H12O2. The NMR data shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl groups, with no methylene groups. This suggests a di-substituted aromatic ring with a vinyl group and two methyl groups, which fits the formula C12H12O2. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group, which is also consistent with this formula. Other options either have too many or too few hydrogens or carbons to match the described NMR and FTIR data. Therefore, the best match is C12H12O2.

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which is consistent with all given formulas. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups, with no methylene protons. The doublet of quartets pattern suggests an ethyl group, which aligns with the molecular formula C12H12O2, as it can accommodate the ethyl group while maintaining the ester functionality. C11H12O2 would not account for the observed splitting pattern indicative of an ethyl group. C12H14O2 and C11H14O2 would have more protons than observed. Thus, C12H12O2 fits the spectral data best, accounting for the total proton count, the splitting patterns, and the presence of an ester group without contradictions.
