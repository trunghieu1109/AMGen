Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hookeâ€™s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The energy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is calculated as (9/2) \hbar \omega, and the degeneracy, or the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions, is found to be 10. These values match option 'choice1', which is (9/2) \hbar \omega , 10. The other options do not match both the calculated energy and degeneracy simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is 'choice1'.
