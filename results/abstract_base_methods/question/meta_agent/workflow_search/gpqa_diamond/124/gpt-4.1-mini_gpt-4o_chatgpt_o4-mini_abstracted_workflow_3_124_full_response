The energy levels depend on the sum of these quantum numbers. For the third excited state, we need to consider the different combinations of n_r and l that result in the same energy. The ground state corresponds to n_r = 0, l = 0, so the first excited state can be n_r = 1, l = 0 or n_r = 0, l = 1. The second excited state could be n_r = 2, l = 0, n_r = 1, l = 1, or n_r = 0, l = 2. The third excited state could be n_r = 3, l = 0, n_r = 2, l = 1, n_r = 1, l = 2, or n_r = 0, l = 3. The energy for the third excited state is E = (2*3 + 0 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. There are 4 combinations of (n_r, l) that give the same energy, corresponding to the third excited state: (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2), and (0, 3). The degeneracy is given by the sum of the degeneracies of these states, which is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, but the choices suggest a different interpretation, likely focusing on only certain states.

The quantum number n is given by n = n_r + l, where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

Additionally, the degeneracy of each energy level in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 5, the degeneracy is (5 + 1)(5 + 2)/2 = 21.
