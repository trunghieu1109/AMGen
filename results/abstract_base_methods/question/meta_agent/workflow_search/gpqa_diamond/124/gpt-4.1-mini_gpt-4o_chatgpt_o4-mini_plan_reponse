        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The quantum system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. In this system, a particle of mass m is subject to a potential V(r) = (1/2) m \\omega^2 r^2, which is characteristic of a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions. The potential is isotropic, meaning it is the same in all directions, and depends only on the radial distance r from the origin. The parameter \\omega is the angular frequency of oscillation, which determines the strength of the potential, and r is the radial distance in spherical polar coordinates. This system is a well-known problem in quantum mechanics, where the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers associated with the radial and angular parts of the wavefunction.; answer - The quantum system is a particle of mass m in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential V(r) = (1/2) m \\omega^2 r^2, where \\omega is the angular frequency and r is the radial distance.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E_{n} = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n is the total quantum number n = n_r + l, with n_r being the radial quantum number and l the angular momentum quantum number. Each energy level is degenerate due to the different possible combinations of n_r and l that yield the same n. The degeneracy of the energy level E_{n} is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, which accounts for the different ways to partition n into n_r and l, considering the spherical harmonics' degeneracy for a given l.; answer - The energy eigenvalues for the 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are E_{n} = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n is the principal quantum number (n = n_r + l).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n is the principal quantum number. The ground state corresponds to n = 0, the first excited state to n = 1, the second excited state to n = 2, and the third excited state to n = 3. Therefore, for the third excited state, n = 3. Plugging this into the formula, we get E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. The degeneracy of the level is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.; answer - (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n is the principal quantum number. The degeneracy of the level is given by the formula (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For the third excited state, we have n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula, we get (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10. Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state energy level is 10. This calculation is correct and matches the known results for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The limitation is that this formula is specific to this system and assumes the potential is exactly of the form V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2.; answer - 10\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The energy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is calculated as (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, and the degeneracy, or the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions, is found to be 10.
