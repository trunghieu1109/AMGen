Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Based on the analysis from the sub-tasks, we have determined the following: 1) G2 is likely the transcription factor, as its knockout results in complete loss of resistance, indicating it acts upstream of other genes involved in anthracnose resistance. 2) G1 is epistatic to G3, as G1's mutation masks the effect of G3 in the resistance phenotype. 3) The gene interactions between G1 and G3 indicate partial redundancy, as both contribute to resistance but neither can fully compensate for the absence of the other. Now, let's evaluate the multiple-choice options: Choice 1 states that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This aligns with our findings: G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show partial redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Choice 2 suggests G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1, which contradicts our findings on epistasis. Choice 3 suggests G1 is a transcription factor, which contradicts our finding that G2 is the transcription factor. Choice 4 suggests G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While the epistasis part is correct, the pleiotropy part does not align with our conclusion of partial redundancy. Therefore, the most consistent conclusion is Choice 1.
