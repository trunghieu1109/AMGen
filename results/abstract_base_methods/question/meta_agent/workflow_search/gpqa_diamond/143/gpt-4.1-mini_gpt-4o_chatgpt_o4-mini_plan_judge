Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_143
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the mean decay distance L to be 4.0655 x 10^-15 m. Upon comparing this calculated value with the given multiple-choice options, it is clear that choice 3 (4.0655 * 10^-15 m) matches the calculated mean decay distance exactly. Therefore, the correct choice is C).
