        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The lifetime \\( \\tau \\) of a particle is related to its decay width \\( \\Gamma_X \\) by the formula \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} \\), where \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately \\( 6.582 \\times 10^{-22} \\) MeV\\cdot s. Given \\( \\Gamma_X = 320 \\) MeV, we can calculate \\( \\tau \\) as follows: \\( \\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ MeV}\\cdot s}{320 \\text{ MeV}} = 2.057 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ s} \\).; answer - 2.057 \\times 10^{-24} s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is calculated using the formula \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} \\). Given the production energy \\( E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} \\) and the mass \\( m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} \\), we can calculate \\( \\gamma \\) as follows: \\( \\gamma = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667 \\). The lifetime \\( \\tau \\) from Sub-task 1 is not directly used in this calculation, but it is relevant for determining the mean decay distance later.; answer - 6.6667\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the mean decay distance L, we use the formula L = gamma * beta * c * tau. From Sub-task 1, we have the lifetime tau = 2.057 x 10^-24 s. From Sub-task 2, we have the Lorentz factor gamma = 6.6667. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. First, we calculate beta using the formula beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). Substituting gamma = 6.6667, we get beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(6.6667)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Now, we can calculate L: L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3 x 10^8 m/s * 2.057 x 10^-24 s = 4.0655 x 10^-15 m. This matches choice 3, which is the correct answer.; answer - C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All agents have calculated the mean decay distance L to be 4.0655 x 10^-15 m. Upon comparing this calculated value with the given multiple-choice options, it is clear that choice 3 (4.0655 * 10^-15 m) matches the calculated mean decay distance exactly. Therefore, the correct choice is C).; answer - C)"
