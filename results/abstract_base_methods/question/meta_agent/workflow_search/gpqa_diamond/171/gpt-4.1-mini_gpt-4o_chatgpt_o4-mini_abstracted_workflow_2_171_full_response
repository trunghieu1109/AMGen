This means the ratio of the populations of the excited states in star_1 to star_2 is 2. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by N_2/N_1 = (g_2/g_1) * exp(-ΔE/kT). Assuming the statistical weights g_2 and g_1 are the same for both stars, the ratio of the populations in star_1 to star_2 is given by exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2) = 2. This simplifies to exp(ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)) = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2).
