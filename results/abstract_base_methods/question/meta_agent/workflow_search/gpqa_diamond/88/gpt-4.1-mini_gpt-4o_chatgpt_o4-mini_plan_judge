Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_88
proposed answer: The sub-task involves matching the determined coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum to the given multiple-choice options. From the analysis provided by the debate agents, the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is expected to have a 'triplet of triplets' coupling pattern. This is because the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group formed during ozonolysis, and the adamantane structure can lead to complex splitting patterns due to its rigid and symmetrical nature. The 'triplet of triplets' pattern arises from the hydrogen being coupled to two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, each causing a triplet splitting. Among the given options, 'triplet of triplets' corresponds to choice B). Therefore, the correct answer choice is B).
