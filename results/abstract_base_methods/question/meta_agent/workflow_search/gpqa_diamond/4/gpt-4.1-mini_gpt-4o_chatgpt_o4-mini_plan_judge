Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.

proposed answer: The normalized eigenvector obtained from the problem is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). This form is typical for a spin-1/2 particle in quantum mechanics, where the angles are halved compared to the full angle θ. The given multiple-choice options are: 
- Choice 1: (cos(θ), e^{iφ}sin(θ)) includes a phase factor and uses full angles, which does not match the obtained eigenvector.
- Choice 2: (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) includes specific numerical coefficients and ħ, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.
- Choice 3: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) matches the obtained eigenvector exactly.
- Choice 4: (√(2/3)ħ cos(θ/2), √(1/3)ħ sin(θ/2)) includes numerical coefficients and ħ, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.
Therefore, the correct choice is the one that matches the normalized eigenvector form exactly, which is Choice 3.
