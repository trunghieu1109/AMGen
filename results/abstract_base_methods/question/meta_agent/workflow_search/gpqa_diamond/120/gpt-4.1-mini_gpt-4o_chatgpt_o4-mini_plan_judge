Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me2CuLi involves nucleophilic attack at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is carbon 1. This attack results in the opening of the epoxide ring and inversion of configuration at carbon 1, changing it from (R) to (S). The methyl group from Me2CuLi is added to carbon 1, and the hydroxyl group is formed at the position where the oxygen was originally located. The other stereocenters retain their configurations: carbon 4 remains (R) and carbon 5 remains (S). Therefore, the product is (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which matches choice A. All agents agree on this reasoning and choice.

proposed answer: The predicted product from Sub-task 5 is (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This product results from the nucleophilic attack of Me2CuLi on the less hindered carbon (C6) of the epoxide, leading to inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration at C6 is S, and after inversion, it becomes R. The other chiral centers retain their original configurations. Comparing this with the multiple-choice options, choice A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol matches the predicted product in terms of both structure and stereochemistry. Therefore, choice A is consistent with the predicted product and is the correct answer.
