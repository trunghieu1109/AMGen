proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}, where \vec{\sigma} are the Pauli matrices and \vec{n} is a unit vector. The operator \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} has eigenvalues +1 and -1, as it is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, which have these eigenvalues. Since the Hamiltonian is a scalar multiple of this operator by the constant \varepsilon, the eigenvalues of H are the eigenvalues of \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} multiplied by \varepsilon. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H are +\varepsilon and -\varepsilon. This matches choice A).
