In this basis, the state vector v = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is already in the correct form. We need to confirm that this state vector is indeed an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. To do this, we apply Px to the vector v and check if we get -ħ times the vector v.

The expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is calculated as v† Pz² v, where v† is the conjugate transpose of v. Calculating this, we have v† = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)† = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Then, ⟨Pz²⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) * [[ħ², 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ħ²]] * (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)ᵀ. This results in ⟨Pz²⟩ = (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.
