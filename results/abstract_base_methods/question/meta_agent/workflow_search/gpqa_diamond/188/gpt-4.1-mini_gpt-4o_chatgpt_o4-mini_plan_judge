Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_54_188
proposed answer: The original question provides four choices: A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon. From the sub-task 4 analysis, it was determined that the Skyrmion is the effective particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. According to the original question's choices, Skyrmion corresponds to choice B). Therefore, the answer is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
