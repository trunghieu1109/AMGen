        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetry refers to a situation in a physical system where the underlying laws possess a certain symmetry, but the state of the system does not exhibit that symmetry. In the context of effective particles, this often leads to the emergence of collective excitations or quasiparticles that are associated with the broken symmetry. For example, in a ferromagnet, the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, and magnons are the associated quasiparticles. In particle physics, the breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD leads to the emergence of pions as Goldstone bosons. Phonons, on the other hand, are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry refers to a situation where the laws of a system have a symmetry, but the system's state does not, leading to emergent particles like magnons, pions, and phonons. Skyrmions are not directly associated with such symmetry breaking.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To identify and characterize each of the given effective particles, we consider their physical nature and typical contexts: \n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective excitations in a system with a spontaneously broken rotational symmetry, such as in a ferromagnet. They represent quantized spin waves.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons that can occur in magnetic systems. They are not directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries in the same way as Goldstone bosons. Instead, they are stable, localized configurations due to their topological properties.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are mesons that arise as Goldstone bosons due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations. They are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice, which is a form of spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nThus, magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, whereas skyrmions are not in the same sense.; answer - Magnons are quasiparticles in ferromagnets associated with broken rotational symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetic systems, not directly linked to symmetry breaking. Pions are Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Phonons are lattice vibration quanta linked to broken translational symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Based on the analysis from Sub-task 2, we can determine which particles arise as a consequence of spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons are associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, making them a result of spontaneously-broken symmetry. Pions are Goldstone bosons that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), so they are also associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. Phonons are quasiparticles that arise from the breaking of translational symmetry in crystal lattices, thus they too are linked to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries in the same way as the others. They are stable due to their topological properties rather than being a consequence of symmetry breaking. Therefore, the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the skyrmion.; answer - Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All agents agree that magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, while skyrmions are not. Magnons arise from the breaking of rotational symmetry, pions from chiral symmetry breaking, and phonons from translational symmetry breaking. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and their stability is due to topological properties rather than symmetry breaking. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry is the skyrmion.; answer - Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The original question provides four choices: A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon. From the sub-task 4 analysis, it was determined that the Skyrmion is the effective particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. According to the original question's choices, Skyrmion corresponds to choice B). Therefore, the answer is B).; answer - B)"
