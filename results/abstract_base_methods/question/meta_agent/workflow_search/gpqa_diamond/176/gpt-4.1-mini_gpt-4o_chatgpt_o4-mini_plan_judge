Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_176
proposed answer: The computed luminosity ratio from the sub-tasks is 2.25. When comparing this value to the provided multiple-choice options (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the closest match is clearly ~2.25. This is because the calculated value exactly matches one of the options, indicating that the calculation aligns perfectly with the given choice. The other options, ~2.35, ~2.32, and ~2.23, deviate from the computed value, making them less accurate. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that matches the computation exactly, which is ~2.25.

proposed answer: The validated luminosity ratio from the reasoning chain is 2.25. The multiple-choice options provided are ~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, and ~2.23. The closest matching factor to the validated luminosity ratio of 2.25 is ~2.25. This choice directly corresponds to the calculated luminosity ratio, confirming that the calculations and reasoning are consistent with the given options. Therefore, the closest matching factor is ~2.25.
