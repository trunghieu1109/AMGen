This implies that we need to consider all forms in which cobalt exists in the solution, including free Co(II) ions and all cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The total cobalt concentration, which includes free Co(II) ions and all complexes, is the appropriate denominator because it represents the sum of all cobalt species present. By using this denominator, we ensure that the percentage reflects the proportion of the specific complex relative to the entire pool of cobalt species, aligning with the question's phrasing 'all cobalt containing species'. This approach is consistent with standard practices in coordination chemistry where the total metal concentration is used to determine the distribution of metal species in solution.; answer: The chosen denominator, which includes free Co(II) ions and all complexes, aligns with the question's phrasing 'all cobalt containing species' because it represents the total concentration of cobalt in all its forms in the solution.
