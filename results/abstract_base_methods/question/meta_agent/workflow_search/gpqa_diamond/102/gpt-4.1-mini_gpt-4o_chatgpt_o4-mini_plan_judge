proposed answer: After evaluating each choice based on the directing effects and order of reactions, it is clear that choice 4 is the best option. The target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, requires the introduction of an acetyl group, a nitro group, and a bromo group. The acetyl group is a meta-director, which means it should be introduced first to ensure that subsequent substitutions occur at the meta positions relative to it. Choice 4 begins with Friedel-Crafts acylation, introducing the acetyl group first, which is crucial for directing the following substitutions correctly. Although the bromination and nitration steps are swapped, the presence of the acetyl group ensures that the substitutions occur at the correct positions, leading to the desired product. Choices 1, 2, and 3 do not start with the acylation step, leading to incorrect substitution patterns or less efficient sequences. Therefore, choice 4 is the most feasible and yields the desired product with the correct substitution pattern.

proposed answer: Based on the analysis and verification in Sub-task 6, the correct sequence of reactions that achieves the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene is Choice 4. This sequence starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce the acetyl group, followed by bromination and nitration, which are directed by the acetyl group to the correct positions. The sequence avoids unnecessary steps that could alter the functional groups and aligns with known chemical principles for high-yield synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice 4.
