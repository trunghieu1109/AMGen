Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_12_157
proposed answer: The dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain is expected to interfere with the protein's ability to form functional dimers, which are crucial for its activity. This interference could lead to the formation of non-functional dimers or aggregates, sequestering both the mutant and wild-type proteins, thereby preventing normal function. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype, even though the wild-type allele is present, because the mutant protein disrupts the overall function of the transcription factor complex. Evaluating the options: Choice 1 suggests loss of dimerization but a wild-type phenotype, which contradicts the dominant-negative effect causing loss-of-function. Choice 2 suggests protein aggregation and loss-of-function, aligning with the expected outcome of the dominant-negative interference. Choice 3 suggests protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, which is possible but not as directly related to aggregation. Choice 4 suggests a gain-of-function, which does not align with the loss-of-function phenotype expected from a dominant-negative mutation. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most likely observed molecular phenotype.
