Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_45
proposed answer: All agents agree that the number of distinct structural products formed from the metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, excluding ethene, is 6. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the structural isomers formed during the reaction. The multiple-choice options provided are 4, 6, 8, and 2. Since the analysis consistently shows that there are 6 distinct structural products, the correct answer choice is B) 6.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
