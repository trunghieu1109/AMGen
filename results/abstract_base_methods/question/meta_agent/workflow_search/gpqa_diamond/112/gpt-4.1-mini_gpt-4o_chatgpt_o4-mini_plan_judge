Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_112
proposed answer: The refined molecular formula obtained from Sub-task 5 is C6H12O2. This formula was determined based on the spectral data: the FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a hydroxyl group (broad peak at 3000 cm^-1) and a carbonyl group (strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1), the 1H NMR spectrum shows vinyl hydrogens indicating an alkene, and the mass spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45 consistent with a CH3CO+ fragment. Among the given multiple-choice options, C6H12O2 is the only formula that can accommodate both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group, as well as an alkene, which matches the FTIR and NMR data. The other options either lack sufficient oxygen atoms or do not fit the hydrogen count needed for the observed functional groups. Therefore, C6H12O2 is the most consistent chemical formula for the unknown compound.
