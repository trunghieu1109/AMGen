Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_73
proposed answer: The computed conditional probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived the first 50 minutes, is 52%. This value matches exactly with one of the provided multiple-choice options, which is 52%. All agents agree that the memoryless property of exponential decay was used to calculate this probability, and it aligns perfectly with choice A). Therefore, the closest matching answer is A) 52%.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_73
proposed answer: The verified conditional decay probability is approximately 43.8%. Among the provided multiple-choice options (52%, 48%, 44%, 40%), the closest match is 44%. This is because 43.8% is very close to 44%, and when rounding 43.8% using typical rounding rules, it rounds to 44%. Therefore, the best choice among the given options is 44%.
