The measurement operators L1z and L2z correspond to the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron individually. The eigenvalues of L1z and L2z are m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron, which can take values -1, 0, or 1 for l = 1.

The probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to have eigenvalues -ħ is the square of this coefficient, which is (sqrt(1/3))^2 = 1/3.

The uncoupled basis states |1, m1> ⊗ |1, m2> have m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m. In this case, m = -1, so possible combinations are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1).
