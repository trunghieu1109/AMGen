Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The derived expression for the electric field magnitude at a point P outside the spherical conductor is E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}. This matches choice4 in the given multiple-choice options. The reasoning is based on the fact that the spherical conductor, being uncharged and having a cavity with a charge +q, will have an electric field outside as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. The symmetry and the shielding effect of the conductor ensure that the external field is equivalent to that of a point charge at the center, leading to the expression E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}. Therefore, the correct choice is choice4.
