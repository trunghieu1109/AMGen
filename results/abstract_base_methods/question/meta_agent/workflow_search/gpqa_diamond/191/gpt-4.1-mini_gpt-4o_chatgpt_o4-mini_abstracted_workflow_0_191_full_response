When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity. By electrostatic induction, an equal and opposite charge +q is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Due to the conductor's spherical symmetry and the fact that it is initially uncharged, the electric field inside the conductor's material (between the cavity and the outer surface) is zero. The electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

According to electrostatic principles, the conductor being uncharged means that the net charge on the conductor is zero. However, the presence of the charge +q inside the cavity will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor. Specifically, a charge of -q will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to ensure the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. This is because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. To balance this, a charge of +q will be induced on the outer surface of the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field outside the conductor will be as if there is a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is because the induced charges on the outer surface of the conductor create an electric field equivalent to that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor at a distance L from the center of the conductor is due to this effective point charge +q at the center.

Due to the spherical symmetry and the fact that the conductor is uncharged overall, the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. The offset of the cavity does not affect the external field due to the conductor's shielding effect. The law of cosines is used to relate the distances involved, but ultimately, the induced charges on the conductor's surface create a field as if there is a point charge at the center of the conductor.

This is due to the spherical symmetry and the shielding effect of the conductor, which causes the induced charges to rearrange such that the external field is as if there is a point charge at the center. The geometric relations involving s, l, and θ are not directly relevant to the electric field at point P outside the conductor, as the field is determined solely by the effective point charge at the center.

The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge -q on the cavity's inner surface and a charge +q on the conductor's outer surface. This results in an effective point charge +q at the center of the conductor as seen from outside. The geometric relations involving vectors and angles are useful for understanding internal distributions but do not affect the external field due to the shielding effect. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the effective charge at the conductor's center, leading to the expression E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²).
