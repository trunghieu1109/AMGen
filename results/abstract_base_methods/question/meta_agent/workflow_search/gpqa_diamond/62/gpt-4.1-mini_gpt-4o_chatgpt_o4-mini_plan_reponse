From Sub-task 1, we have the reduced mass \u03bc = 20/11 amu. We need to convert this to kg for consistency with SI units. 1 amu = 1.66053906660 \u00d7 10^(-27) kg, so \u03bc = (20/11) * 1.66053906660 \u00d7 10^(-27) kg.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, typically with rotational quantum number J = 0 and vibrational quantum number v = 0. The next accessible state with the minimum energy difference would be either the first excited rotational state (J = 1, v = 0) or the first excited vibrational state (J = 0, v = 1). The energy difference for a rotational transition from J = 0 to J = 1 is given by 2B, where B is the rotational constant. The energy difference for a vibrational transition from v = 0 to v = 1 is given by \u0394Evib = \u0127\u03c9. Comparing these, the rotational transition typically has a much smaller energy difference than the vibrational transition, as B is usually much smaller than \u0127\u03c9.

The energy difference for this transition is \u0394E = E_rot(J = 1) - E_rot(J = 0) = B * 1 * (1 + 1) = 2B. The vibrational contribution does not change as we remain in the v = 0 state.

The lowest possible energy transition from this state involves increasing the vibrational quantum number to v = 1 (first vibrational excitation) and the rotational quantum number to J = 1 (lowest rotational excitation). The energy required for this transition is the sum of the vibrational energy quantum \u0394E_vib = \u0127\u03c9 and the rotational energy quantum \u0394E_rot = 2B (since \u0394E_rot = B(J(J + 1) - 0(0 + 1)) = B(1(1 + 1)) = 2B).

Since 1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2, the units are consistent, and the result is in N*s. The calculated momentum p = 1.40612643 \u00d7 10^(-28) N*s is indeed closest to choice 4, which is p = 1.4 \u00d7 10^(-28) N*s. The calculation is correct, and the choice matches the expected result. Therefore, the answer is physically plausible and consistent with the given choices.; answer - p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - The calculated photon momentum from Subtask 7b is 1.40612643 \u00d7 10^(-28) N*s. When comparing this value to the multiple-choice options, option 4 (p = 1.4 \u00d7 10^(-28) N*s) is the closest in value. The absolute difference between the calculated value and option 4 is minimal, and they are of the same order of magnitude. This choice is consistent with the physical calculations and units verified in Subtask 7b. Therefore, option 4 is the most accurate and physically plausible choice.; answer - D)"
