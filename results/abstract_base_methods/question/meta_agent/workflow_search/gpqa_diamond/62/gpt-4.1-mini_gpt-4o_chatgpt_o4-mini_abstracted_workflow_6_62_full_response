Given Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu, we first calculate the reduced mass in amu: μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 amu. To convert this to kilograms, we use the conversion factor 1 amu = 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg. Therefore, μ = (20/11) * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg = 3.01916212018 × 10^(-27) kg.; answer - 3.01916212018 × 10^(-27) kg\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The moment of inertia (I) of a diatomic molecule is calculated using the formula I = μ * R^2, where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length. From Sub-task 1, we have the reduced mass μ = 3.01916212018 × 10^(-27) kg. The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which we need to convert to meters. Since 1 angstrom = 1 × 10^(-10) meters, R = 2 × 10^(-10) meters. Now, we can calculate the moment of inertia: I = μ * R^2 = 3.01916212018 × 10^(-27) kg * (2 × 10^(-10) m)^2 = 3.01916212018 × 10^(-27) kg * 4 × 10^(-20) m^2 = 1.207664848072 × 10^(-46) kg·m^2.; answer - 1.207664848072 × 10^(-46) kg·m^2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - The rotational constant B in energy units is given by the formula B = ħ² / (2I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and I is the moment of inertia.

This calculation will give us the rotational constant B in units of energy (Joules).; answer - B = ħ² / (2I) = (1.054571817 × 10^(-34) J·s)² / (2 × 1.207664848072 × 10^(-46) kg·m²)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3b output: thinking - To calculate the rotational constant B, we use the formula B = ħ² / (2I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054571817 × 10^(-34) J·s) and I is the moment of inertia (1.207664848072 × 10^(-46) kg·m²) from Sub-task 2.

First, calculate ħ²: (1.054571817 × 10^(-34))² = 1.112121 × 10^(-68) J²·s². Then, calculate 2I: 2 × 1.207664848072 × 10^(-46) = 2.415329696144 × 10^(-46) kg·m². Finally, divide these results: B = 1.112121 × 10^(-68) / 2.415329696144 × 10^(-46) = 4.605 × 10^(-23) J.

Substituting the values, we get ΔEvib = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s * 4 × 10^14 rad/s = 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J. Therefore, the vibrational energy quantum is 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) Joules.; answer - 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - In the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized and can be described by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = BJ(J + 1), where J is the rotational quantum number and B is the rotational constant. For a molecule in its fundamental state, the vibrational quantum number v = 0 and the rotational quantum number J = 0. The lowest possible energy transition from this state involves increasing the vibrational quantum number to v = 1 (first vibrational excitation) and the rotational quantum number to J = 1 (lowest rotational excitation). The energy required for this transition is the sum of the vibrational energy quantum ΔE_vib = ħω and the rotational energy quantum ΔE_rot = 2B (since ΔE_rot = B(J(J + 1) - 0(0 + 1)) = B(1(1 + 1)) = 2B). From the sub-task answers, we have ΔE_vib = 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J and B = 4.605 × 10^(-23) J. Therefore, the total energy for the transition is ΔE_total = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J + 2 × 4.605 × 10^(-23) J = 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J + 9.21 × 10^(-23) J = 4.2274972 × 10^(-20) J. The momentum of the absorbed photon is related to its energy by the relation p = E/c, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s). Thus, the momentum of the photon is p = 4.2274972 × 10^(-20) J / 3 × 10^8 m/s = 1.4091657 × 10^(-28) N·s.

The total energy difference is ΔE = ΔEvib + ΔErot = 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J + 9.21 × 10^(-23) J. Since 9.21 × 10^(-23) J is much smaller than 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J, the total energy difference is approximately 4.2182872 × 10^(-20) J.

We need to ensure unit consistency, so we use these values directly in the formula: p = (4.2183793 × 10^(-20) J) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s). Calculating this gives p = 1.40612643 × 10^(-28) kg*m/s, which is equivalent to N*s since 1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2.

The speed of light c is 3.0 × 10^8 m/s. The calculation performed was p = (4.2183793 × 10^(-20) J) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s), resulting in p = 1.40612643 × 10^(-28) kg*m/s. Since 1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2, the units are consistent, and the result is in N*s. The calculated momentum p = 1.40612643 × 10^(-28) N*s is indeed closest to choice 4, which is p = 1.4 × 10^(-28) N*s.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = BJ(J + 1), where J is the rotational quantum number and B is the rotational constant. For a molecule in its fundamental state, the vibrational quantum number v = 0 and the rotational quantum number J = 0. The lowest possible energy transition from this state involves increasing the vibrational quantum number to v = 1 (first vibrational excitation) and the rotational quantum number to J = 1 (lowest rotational excitation). The energy required for this transition is the sum of the vibrational energy quantum ΔE_vib = ħω and the rotational energy quantum ΔE_rot = 2B (since ΔE_rot = B(J(J + 1) - 0(0 + 1)) = B(1(1 + 1)) = 2B).

Since 1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2, the units are consistent, and the result is in N*s. The calculated momentum p = 1.40612643 × 10^(-28) N*s is indeed closest to choice 4, which is p = 1.4 × 10^(-28) N*s.
