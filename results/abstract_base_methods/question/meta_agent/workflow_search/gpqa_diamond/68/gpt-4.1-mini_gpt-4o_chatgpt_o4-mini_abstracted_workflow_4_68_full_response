The proper lifetime of the particle X0 is given as tau_0 = 8e-16 s. From Sub-task 1, we have calculated the Lorentz factor gamma to be approximately 7.92. The formula for time dilation is tau = gamma * tau_0. Substituting the given values, we have tau = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Calculating this gives tau = 6.336e-15 s.

The survival probability P(t) of a particle is given by P(t) = e^(-t/tau), where tau is the dilated lifetime. We want at least 30% of the particles to decay, which means 70% should survive. Therefore, we set P(t) = 0.7 and solve for t: 0.7 = e^(-t/tau). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives -t/tau = ln(0.7), so t = -tau * ln(0.7). Using the dilated lifetime tau = 6.336e-15 s from Sub-task 2, we find t = -6.336e-15 s * ln(0.7). Calculating this gives t ≈ 1.897e-15 s. The decay length L_min is then given by L_min = v * t, where v is the speed of the particle. The speed v can be approximated as c, the speed of light, since the particle is highly relativistic.

The calculation correctly uses the dilated lifetime and the speed of light to find the decay length. However, the final answer provided (2.08*1e-6 m) does not match the calculated value (5.691e-7 m). This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the final selection of the answer choice. The limitations of this approach include the assumption that the particle travels at the speed of light, which is an approximation, and the assumption that the decay follows a simple exponential law without considering other possible interactions or effects in the bubble chamber.; correct: The correct answer should be based on the calculated decay length, which is approximately 5.691e-7 m.
