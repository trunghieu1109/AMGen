Question: Example(question='For a magnetic field \\vec{B}, parallel to Oz, with small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy \\Delta E of Hydrogen atom with wavelength \\lambda=0.4861\\mu m.\n\nPS: for the maths use an online LaTeX editor.', choice1='\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E', choice2='\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\gg\\Delta E', choice3='\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle =\\Delta E', choice4='\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle >\\Delta E', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_107
proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, it was determined that the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is four orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \). This means that \( \langle H \rangle \) is negligible compared to \( \Delta E \), leading to the conclusion that \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \). Among the given choices, choice A) \( \left\langle H\right\rangle \ll\Delta E \) correctly represents this relationship.
