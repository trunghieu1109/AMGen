Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_67
proposed answer: The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma * B * ħ/2 * σy. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz⟩(t), oscillates due to the precession of the spin around the y-axis. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, which is proportional to the coefficient of the Hamiltonian: gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma * B. This matches the choice (B) in the multiple-choice options.
