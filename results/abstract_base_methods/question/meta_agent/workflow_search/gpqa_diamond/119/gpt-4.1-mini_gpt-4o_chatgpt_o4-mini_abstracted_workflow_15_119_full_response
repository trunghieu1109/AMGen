Since distance d is inversely proportional to parallax, d = 1/plx, the number of stars per unit distance interval becomes proportional to (1/plx)². To find the number of stars per unit parallax interval, we need to account for the change in variable from distance to parallax. The differential relation |dd/dplx| = 1/plx² indicates how the distance changes with parallax. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax interval is the product of the number of stars per unit distance interval and |dd/dplx|, which is (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is given by the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (Δd). Therefore, the volume of the shell is 4πd²Δd. This expression arises because the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and when considering a thin shell, the volume is essentially the area times the thickness. This is a standard result in geometry. We use the relationship from Sub-task 1, d = 1/plx, to understand how this volume element relates to parallax, but the expression for the shell volume itself is independent of parallax and purely geometric.; answer - The differential volume element at a distance d is given by 4πd²Δd, where d is the distance to the shell and Δd is the thickness of the shell.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To express the number of stars in the differential shell volume at distance d, we start by assuming a uniform spatial density n, meaning there are n stars per unit volume. The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d is given by 4πd²Δd, as derived in Sub-task 2. Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is the product of the volume and the density, which is n * 4πd²Δd. For the number of stars per unit distance interval, we consider the number of stars per unit thickness Δd, which is n * 4πd². This shows that the number of stars per unit distance interval scales with the surface area of the shell, which is proportional to d². Using the relationship from Sub-task 1, where d = 1/plx, we can express this in terms of parallax. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is related to the number of stars per unit distance by the derivative of d with respect to plx, which is -1/plx².

This differential relation is important for changing variables in the number count, as it relates changes in distance to changes in parallax. The transformation assumes that stars are uniformly distributed in space, which may not be true in reality.
