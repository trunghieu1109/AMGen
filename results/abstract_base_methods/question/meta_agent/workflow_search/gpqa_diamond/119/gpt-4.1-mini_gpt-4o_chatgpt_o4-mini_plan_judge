proposed answer: All agents agree that the number of stars per unit range of parallax scales as ~ 1/plx^3. This conclusion is based on the relationship between distance and parallax, where distance d = 1/plx. The number density of stars per unit distance scales with the volume element, which is proportional to d^2. When expressed in terms of parallax, this results in a scaling of ~ 1/plx^3. Each agent has independently derived this result and compared it with the multiple-choice options, consistently selecting choice1: ~ 1/plx^3. Therefore, the final decision on the functional form is that the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to ~ 1/plx^3.

proposed answer: The derived scaling law for the number of stars per unit parallax interval is consistent with both physical intuition and mathematical correctness. The reasoning is based on the fact that the number of stars per unit distance interval scales as the square of the distance, d², due to the volume of space increasing with the square of the distance in a uniform distribution. Since distance d is inversely proportional to parallax (d = 1/plx), the number of stars per unit distance interval becomes proportional to (1/plx)². To convert this to the number of stars per unit parallax interval, we use the differential relation |dd/dplx| = 1/plx², which indicates how the distance changes with parallax. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax interval is the product of the number of stars per unit distance interval and |dd/dplx|, which is (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴. This confirms that the scaling law is consistent with both physical intuition and mathematical correctness. The final answer matches the expected multiple-choice format, which is choice D: '~ 1/plx^4'.
