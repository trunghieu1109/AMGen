This conclusion was based on the understanding that the introduction of the electron beam increases the frequency of collisions due to electron scattering, thus reducing the mean free path. Given the multiple-choice options, option C) \'λ2 < λ1\' directly matches this conclusion. Options A) and B) suggest that λ2 is either equal to or greater than λ1, which contradicts the findings. Option D) suggests λ2 is significantly greater than λ1, which also contradicts the conclusion that λ2 is less than λ1 due to increased collision frequency.

This conclusion arises because the introduction of the electron beam increases the collision frequency with gas molecules, thereby reducing the mean free path.

The other options do not fit this conclusion: A) suggests λ2 equals λ1, which contradicts the observation of increased collision frequency; B) suggests λ1 is less than λ2, which also contradicts the finding; D) suggests λ2 is equal to or greater than 1.22 times λ1, which implies an increase in mean free path, contrary to the effects of electron scattering.

At such low pressures, the number density of gas molecules is extremely low, leading to infrequent collisions between them.
