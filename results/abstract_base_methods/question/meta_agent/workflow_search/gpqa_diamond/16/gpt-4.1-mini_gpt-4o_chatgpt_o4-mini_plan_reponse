        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented by the equilibrium reaction: Ca-EDTA \u21cc Ca\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b. The stability constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex: Ca\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b \u21cc Ca-EDTA. Therefore, the dissociation constant (K_d) for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the stability constant: K_d = 1/K_Ca-EDTA = 1/(5x10^10). The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2\u207a and EDTA\u2074\u207b that dissociates. Then, the equilibrium concentrations are: [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. The equilibrium expression for the dissociation is: K_d = [Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]/[Ca-EDTA] = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x).; answer - The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is: K_d = [Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]/[Ca-EDTA] = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x), where K_d = 1/(5x10^10).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Based on the output from Sub-task 1, we have the equilibrium reaction: Ca-EDTA \u21cc Ca\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b. Let x be the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca\u00b2\u207a] at equilibrium, which will also be the concentration of free EDTA\u2074\u207b due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation. The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be 0.02 - x. Thus, the equilibrium concentrations are: [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. These expressions are derived from the assumption that x amount of Ca-EDTA dissociates into x amount of Ca\u00b2\u207a and x amount of EDTA\u2074\u207b, reducing the concentration of Ca-EDTA by x.; answer - Let x be the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca\u00b2\u207a] at equilibrium. Then, [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is derived from the equilibrium reaction: Ca-EDTA \u21cc Ca\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b. The dissociation constant K_d is the inverse of the stability constant K_Ca-EDTA, which is given as 5x10^10. Therefore, K_d = 1/(5x10^10). From Sub-task 2, we have defined the equilibrium concentrations as [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Substituting these into the equilibrium expression gives K_d = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x). The equation relating the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the equilibrium concentrations of the species is x\u00b2/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10). This equation is based on the assumption that the dissociation is minimal, which is reasonable given the large stability constant, but it should be verified after solving for x to ensure that x is indeed much smaller than 0.02.; answer - The equilibrium constant expression is K_d = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x), where K_d = 1/(5x10^10). The equation relating the initial complex concentration and the equilibrium concentrations is x\u00b2/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To solve the equilibrium expression for the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca\u00b2\u207a], we start with the equation derived in Sub-task 3: x\u00b2/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10). Here, x represents the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca\u00b2\u207a]. Given the large stability constant, we assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, allowing us to approximate the denominator as 0.02. This simplifies the equation to x\u00b2/0.02 = 1/(5x10^10). Solving for x, we get x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5x10^10). Calculating this gives x\u00b2 = 4x10^-13, so x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca\u00b2\u207a] is approximately 2x10^-7 M. The previous answer of 6.3x10^-7 M was incorrect, as the correct calculation shows 2x10^-7 M.; answer - 2x10^-7 M\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The calculated concentration of free calcium ions [Ca\u00b2\u207a] from Sub-task 4 is 2x10^-7 M.
