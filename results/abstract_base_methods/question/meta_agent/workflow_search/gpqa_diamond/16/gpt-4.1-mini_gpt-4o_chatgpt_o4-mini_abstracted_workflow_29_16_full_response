The stability constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA. Therefore, the dissociation constant (K_d) for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the stability constant: K_d = 1/K_Ca-EDTA = 1/(5x10^10). The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ that dissociates. Then, the equilibrium concentrations are: [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. The equilibrium expression for the dissociation is: K_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA] = x²/(0.02 - x).; answer - The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is: K_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA] = x²/(0.02 - x), where K_d = 1/(5x10^10).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Based on the output from Sub-task 1, we have the equilibrium reaction: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be 0.02 - x. Thus, the equilibrium concentrations are: [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. These expressions are derived from the assumption that x amount of Ca-EDTA dissociates into x amount of Ca²⁺ and x amount of EDTA⁴⁻, reducing the concentration of Ca-EDTA by x.; answer - Let x be the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺] at equilibrium.

The dissociation constant K_d is the inverse of the stability constant K_Ca-EDTA, which is given as 5x10^10. Therefore, K_d = 1/(5x10^10). From Sub-task 2, we have defined the equilibrium concentrations as [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Substituting these into the equilibrium expression gives K_d = x²/(0.02 - x). The equation relating the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the equilibrium concentrations of the species is x²/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10). This equation is based on the assumption that the dissociation is minimal, which is reasonable given the large stability constant, but it should be verified after solving for x to ensure that x is indeed much smaller than 0.02.; answer - The equilibrium constant expression is K_d = x²/(0.02 - x), where K_d = 1/(5x10^10).

Here, x represents the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺]. Given the large stability constant, we assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, allowing us to approximate the denominator as 0.02. This simplifies the equation to x²/0.02 = 1/(5x10^10). Solving for x, we get x² = 0.02/(5x10^10). Calculating this gives x² = 4x10^-13, so x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺] is approximately 2x10^-7 M.

We let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ ions that dissociate from the complex. Initially, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺] is x, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ ions is also x, and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 - x. These variables represent the equilibrium concentrations of the species in the solution. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are: [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x.; answer: Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ ions that dissociate.

We let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that dissociates from the complex. Therefore, at equilibrium, the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺] is x. Similarly, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ ions is also x, since they dissociate in a 1:1 ratio. The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and at equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is reduced by the amount that dissociates, which is x. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is (0.02 - x). These expressions align with the equilibrium expression derived in Sub-task 1: K_d = x²/(0.02 - x).; answer: Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates.

From Sub-task 2, we defined the equilibrium concentrations as [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. The equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation is K_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA]. Substituting the equilibrium concentrations into this expression gives K_d = x²/(0.02 - x). Since K_d = 1/(5x10^10), we have the equation x²/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10). This equation relates the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the equilibrium concentrations of the species.; answer: The equilibrium constant expression is K_d = x²/(0.02 - x), where K_d = 1/(5x10^10).

The expression K_d = x²/(0.02 - x) is derived from the equilibrium concentrations and the given dissociation constant. However, the limitation of this formulation is the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02, which allows us to simplify the equation by assuming 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. This assumption is valid if the dissociation is minimal, which is likely given the large KCa-EDTA value, but it should be checked for consistency after solving for x.; answer: The equilibrium expression is K_d = x²/(0.02 - x), where K_d = 1/(5x10^10).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Cubc, refining equilibrium expression, thinking: The equilibrium constant expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is derived from the equilibrium reaction: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻.
