Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_16
proposed answer: The calculated concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺] from Sub-task 4 is 2x10^-7 M. We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options: A) 1.0x10^-2 M, B) 5.0x10^-3 M, C) 6.3x10^-7 M, D) 2.0x10^-2 M. The option closest to 2x10^-7 M is C) 6.3x10^-7 M, even though there is a slight discrepancy, it is the closest match among the options provided. The other options are orders of magnitude away from the calculated value, making C the most reasonable choice.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
