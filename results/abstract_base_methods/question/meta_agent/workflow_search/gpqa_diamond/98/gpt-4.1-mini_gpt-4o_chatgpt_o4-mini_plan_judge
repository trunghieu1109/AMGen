Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group, as evidenced by the broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹ and the strong C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹. This feature is common to all candidate compounds. The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns, such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, which suggest hydrogens in complex environments, likely due to branching and chiral centers. The absence of vinyl hydrogens indicates no C=C double bonds, consistent with all options. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (choice B) has a structure that includes a carboxylic acid, branched alkane, and chiral centers, which can lead to the observed complex splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum. The presence of ethyl groups in choice B would lead to the doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets observed in the NMR, fitting the data better than the other choices. The other candidates either have different alkyl groups or branching that would not lead to the same NMR splitting patterns. Therefore, the compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH is the best match for the spectral data.

Answer:CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Extracted answer: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which is common to all candidate compounds. The key differentiator is the 1H NMR data, which shows a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These complex splitting patterns suggest a proton environment with multiple neighboring protons. Among the options, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (choice B) is the only compound that would exhibit such splitting patterns due to the presence of CH protons with multiple neighboring protons. The other compounds, especially those with ethyl groups, would show different splitting patterns that do not match the observed data. Therefore, the best match for the spectral features is choice B.
