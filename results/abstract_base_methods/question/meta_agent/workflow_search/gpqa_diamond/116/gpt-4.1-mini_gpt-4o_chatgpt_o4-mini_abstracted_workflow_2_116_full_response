This typically occurs in molecules that have chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The presence of a chiral center allows for two enantiomers, which are mirror images that cannot be superimposed. These enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in different directions, which is why they are called optically active.; answer - Optical isomerism occurs in molecules with chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers, which rotate plane-polarized light differently.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound consists of a biphenyl system which can exhibit chirality if the substituents on the biphenyl rings prevent free rotation, leading to atropisomerism. However, the presence of identical substituents on both rings (dinitro and dicarboxylate) suggests symmetry, which might negate optical activity unless steric hindrance prevents rotation. \n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the second carbon (C2) because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, a carboxylate group, and a hydrogen atom. This makes it optically active. \n3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers as it consists of a ketone group flanked by two phenyl rings, which are symmetrical. \n4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is an alkene with trans configuration, but it does not have chiral centers since the two substituents on each of the double-bonded carbons are identical (both are methyl groups). \nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) due to the presence of a chiral center, and dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) due to potential atropisomerism if rotation is restricted.; answer: 1 and 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent zn9q, analyzing molecular structures for chiral centers, thinking: To determine if a compound exhibits optical isomerism, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, leading to non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Let's analyze each compound: \n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound has a biphenyl structure, which can exhibit chirality if the rotation about the single bond is restricted, but typically requires sterically bulky groups to prevent rotation. However, without more information on the specific groups, it's hard to conclude. \n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, methyl group, hydrogen, and the ester group). Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism. \n\n3. Benzophenone: This compound is symmetrical and does not have any chiral centers. It cannot exhibit optical isomerism. \n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is a trans-alkene, which is not chiral. Although it has geometric isomerism (cis/trans), it does not have optical isomerism as there are no chiral centers.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compound 2 has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.; answer: 2 and 3\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ZmCU, analyzing molecular structures for chiral centers, thinking: To determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers.

Compound 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, has a chiral center at the second carbon, making it optically active. Compounds 3 and 4 do not have chiral centers or features that would lead to optical isomerism.
