            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms such that they are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This typically occurs in molecules that have chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The presence of a chiral center allows for two enantiomers, which are mirror images that cannot be superimposed. These enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in different directions, which is why they are called optically active.; answer - Optical isomerism occurs in molecules with chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers, which rotate plane-polarized light differently.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's analyze each compound: 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound consists of a biphenyl structure, which can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the phenyl rings create a non-superimposable mirror image. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon, which is bonded to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, a carboxylate group, and a hydrogen, making it optically active. 3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers as it consists of a carbonyl group flanked by two phenyl rings, and there is no asymmetry. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound does not have chiral centers as it is a symmetric molecule with a double bond that does not allow for chirality. Based on this analysis, compounds 1 and 2 have the potential for optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality.; answer - 1 and 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Based on the structural analysis from Sub-task 2, compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) can exhibit optical isomerism due to potential axial chirality in the biphenyl structure. Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center at the second carbon, making it optically active. Compound 3 (benzophenone) and compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) do not have chiral centers or features that would lead to optical isomerism. Therefore, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.; answer - 1 and 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All agents agree that compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibit optical isomerism. The multiple-choice options provided are: choice1: '2 and 3', choice2: '1 and 2', choice3: '3 and 4', choice4: '1, 2 and 4'. The only choice that includes both compounds 1 and 2 is choice2: '1 and 2'. Therefore, the correct answer is choice2, which corresponds to option B).; answer - B)"
