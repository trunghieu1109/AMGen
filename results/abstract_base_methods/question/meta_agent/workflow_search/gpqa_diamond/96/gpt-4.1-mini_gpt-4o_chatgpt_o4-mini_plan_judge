Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Klinefelter's syndrome, characterized by a 47,XXY karyotype, has less severe phenotypic consequences compared to Down's syndrome due to the process of X-inactivation. X-inactivation is an epigenetic mechanism where one of the X chromosomes in XXY individuals is largely inactivated, reducing the impact of having an extra X chromosome. This process involves chromatin modifications, such as methylation, which silence one of the X chromosomes. In contrast, Down's syndrome involves an extra chromosome 21, and there is no similar mechanism to inactivate the extra autosome, leading to more severe phenotypic consequences. Among the given options, 'chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote' is directly related to epigenetic regulation and X-inactivation, making it the most relevant mechanism for explaining the less prominent phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome.
