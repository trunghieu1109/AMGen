Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_87
proposed answer: The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences observed in the proliferating cells from Peyer's patches is indicative of somatic hypermutation. This process occurs in B cells after they have been activated by an antigen, leading to the introduction of point mutations in the variable regions of the antibody genes. This increases the diversity of antibodies and allows for affinity maturation. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not affect antibody gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the constant region of the antibody, not the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development to initially generate antibody diversity, but the high variability observed in this context is due to somatic hypermutation occurring after antigen exposure. Therefore, the correct answer is somatic hypermutation.
