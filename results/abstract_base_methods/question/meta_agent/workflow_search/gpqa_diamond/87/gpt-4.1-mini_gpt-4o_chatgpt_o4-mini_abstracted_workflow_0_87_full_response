This process occurs after B cells are activated by an antigen and involves the introduction of point mutations into the variable regions of antibody genes, enhancing antibody diversity and affinity maturation. Complement activation, class switching recombination, and VDJ recombination do not account for this variability. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not affect antibody gene variability.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs in B cells after they have been activated by an antigen, introducing mutations into the variable regions of the antibody genes to increase diversity and improve antibody affinity. This process is distinct from complement activation, class switching recombination, and VDJ recombination. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not affect antibody gene variability.
