Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_122
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame. The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is given as 60,000 km/s. From the previous sub-tasks, the time interval in the Galaxy frame is approximately 51.0205 seconds due to time dilation. To find the distance traveled, we multiply the velocity by the time interval: Distance = Velocity * Time = 60,000 km/s * 51.0205 s = 3,061,230 km. We then compare this calculated distance with the provided multiple-choice options: A) 2,880,000 km, B) 3,000,000 km, C) 3,060,000 km, D) 2,940,000 km. The closest match to our calculated distance of 3,061,230 km is option C) 3,060,000 km. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the calculation of the Lorentz factor and time dilation, but option C is the best match.
