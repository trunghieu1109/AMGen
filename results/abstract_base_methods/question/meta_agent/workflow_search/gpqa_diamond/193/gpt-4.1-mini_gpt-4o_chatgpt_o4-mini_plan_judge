Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The simplified partition function expression from Sub-task 5 is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 4e^(Jβ) + 2e^(-Jβ). We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options:
1. Z = 2 e^(3J\beta) + 6e^(-J\beta)
2. Z = 2e^(2J\beta) + 6e^(-2J\beta)
3. Z = 6e^(2J\beta) + 2e^(-2J\beta)
4. Z = 2 e^(-3J\beta) + 6e^(J\beta)

The expression from Sub-task 5 does not match any of the given options exactly. However, the closest match in terms of structure is option 1, Z = 2 e^(3J\beta) + 6e^(-J\beta), because it has a term 2e^(3Jβ) which matches the first term of our expression. However, the second term 6e^(-J\beta) does not match 4e^(Jβ) + 2e^(-Jβ). None of the options match exactly, but option 1 is the closest in terms of having the correct first term.
