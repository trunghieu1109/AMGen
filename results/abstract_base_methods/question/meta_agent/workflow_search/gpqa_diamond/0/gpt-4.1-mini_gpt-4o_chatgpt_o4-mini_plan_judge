Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In Sub-task 3, it was determined that the minimum energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two energy levels should be greater than 3.62 x 10^-7 eV. Among the given multiple-choice options, 10^-4 eV is the only option that is greater than this calculated minimum energy difference. The other options, 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, and 10^-8 eV, are all smaller than 3.62 x 10^-7 eV and therefore do not meet the requirement for clear resolution as per the energy-time uncertainty principle. Therefore, 10^-4 eV is the correct choice as it is the only option that allows for the clear resolution of the two energy levels.
