In this problem, each charge is 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P. Therefore, the potential energy between the 13th charge and one of the 12 charges is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 m = 2k * e^2 / m. Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy contribution from these interactions is 12 * (2k * e^2 / 2 m) = 12k * e^2 / m.

The electrostatic potential energy between any two charges is given by the formula U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In an icosahedron, each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices, and the distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same. We need to calculate the potential energy for each pair of charges and sum them up. Since there are 12 charges, there are a total of 12 * 5 / 2 = 30 unique pairs (since each pair is counted twice in the 12 * 5 calculation). The charge on each particle is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e. The distance between adjacent vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2 m can be calculated using geometry, but for simplicity, we assume the distance is approximately 2 m (since the exact geometry is complex and the problem might be simplified). Therefore, the potential energy for each pair is U_pair = k * (2e)^2 / 2 m. The total energy is 30 * U_pair. Using k = 8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2 and e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C, we can calculate the total energy.; answer - The electrostatic potential energy contributions between the 12 charges on the sphere is calculated by considering the 30 unique pairs of charges, each contributing an energy of U_pair = k * (2e)^2 / 2 m, where k is Coulomb's constant and e is the elementary charge.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The total electrostatic potential energy of the system is the sum of the energy contributions from the interactions between the 13th charge at point P and the 12 charges at 2 m distance, and the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.
