Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_179
proposed answer: The calculated minimum energy value from the previous sub-task is 2.822 x 10^-26 J. We need to compare this value with the given multiple-choice options to select the correct one. The options provided are: A) 2.822 x 10^-26, B) 5.645 x 10^-26, C) 7.056 x 10^-27, and D) 122.330. The calculated value exactly matches option A) 2.822 x 10^-26. Therefore, the correct choice is A.
