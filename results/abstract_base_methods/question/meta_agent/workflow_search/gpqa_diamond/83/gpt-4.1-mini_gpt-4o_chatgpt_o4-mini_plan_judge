Iteration: abstracted_workflow_56_83
proposed answer: All agents agree that the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm is the ability to decompose the problem into smaller, independent tasks. The 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation' is identified as the most relevant choice because it directly relates to the decomposition of the matrix exponential into simpler parts that can be computed in parallel. This decomposition is crucial for parallelization. The other options, such as 'Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', 'Stability analysis', and 'Complex roots of fractional approximation', do not directly facilitate parallelization as they do not address the decomposition into parallelizable tasks. Therefore, the correct choice is C.
