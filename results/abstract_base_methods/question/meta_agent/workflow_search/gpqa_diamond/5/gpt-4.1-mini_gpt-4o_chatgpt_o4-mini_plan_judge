Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The energy eigenvalue expression derived from the potential is E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ√(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/(2m)), which represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the x and y directions. To match this with the given multiple-choice options, we express the energy in terms of a single frequency by factoring out ħ√(k/m). This gives E = ħ√(k/m)[(n_x + 1/2)√2 + (n_y + 1/2)(1/√2)]. Simplifying further, this can be approximated to E ≈ ħ√(k/m)[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]. This expression closely matches choice A: E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ√(k/m). The structure of the terms and the coefficients in front of ħ√(k/m) align with choice A, making it the best match.
