Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_139
proposed answer: The calculated sum of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X is 29. The multiple-choice options provided are 29, 25, 35, and 31. The calculated sum matches option '29', which confirms that the correct answer is option A).

proposed answer: The sub-task 3d calculated the sum of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X as 130 amu. However, this value does not match any of the provided multiple-choice options (29, 25, 35, 31). The Chain-of-Thought Agent MTJm suggested that the closest logical choice based on the context and typical atomic masses would be 31, which might correspond to a different interpretation of the isotopes involved or a different set of elements considered. Therefore, the correct answer, based on the options provided and the reasoning given, is 31, which corresponds to choice D.
