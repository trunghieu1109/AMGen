        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains equal moles of salts A and B. The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g. Let the molar masses of salts A and B be M_A and M_B respectively. Since the mixture is equimolar, we have n_A = n_B = n, where n is the number of moles of each salt in the mixture. The total mass is given by n(M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g. To find the total moles of salts A and B, we need the molar mass of the individual salts or some other information to proceed further. However, since this is a sub-task question, it may not require the actual calculation of moles but understanding that the total moles of the mixture can be found once the molar masses are known or given. Without additional information, we cannot find the exact number of moles yet, but we can express it in terms of the molar masses: n = 7.20 / (M_A + M_B).; answer - The total moles of salts A and B can be expressed as n = 7.20 / (M_A + M_B) where M_A and M_B are the molar masses of salts A and B respectively.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Upon heating the equimolar mixture of salts A and B to 200\u00b0C without air, a mixture of gases is formed. The gases are passed through three tubes: Tube \u21161 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, Tube \u21162 with Ca(OH)2 solution, and Tube \u21163 with red-hot copper. The increase in mass of Tube \u21161 by 3.60 g indicates the absorption of water vapor, suggesting that water is one of the gaseous products. The increase in mass of Tube \u21163 by 0.80 g indicates the formation of CuO, suggesting that oxygen is another gaseous product. The fact that the weight of Tube \u21162 does not change indicates that no CO2 is present, as Ca(OH)2 would react with CO2 to form CaCO3. The remaining gas, 2.24 liters at STP, could be a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen. Therefore, the gaseous products likely include H2O, O2, and possibly N2. The total moles of gases can be related back to the moles of salts A and B using stoichiometry and the molar masses of the gases.; answer - The gaseous products formed are likely H2O and O2, with possibly N2 remaining, based on the changes in mass of the tubes and the volume of gas C.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The experimental data from the three tubes can be interpreted as follows: Tube \u21161, containing anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, increased in weight by 3.60 g, indicating the absorption of water vapor (H2O). The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so the moles of water absorbed are 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol. Tube \u21162, containing Ca(OH)2 solution, showed no weight change, indicating that no CO2 was present, as CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3, causing a weight increase. Tube \u21163, containing red-hot copper, increased in weight by 0.80 g, indicating the formation of CuO from the reaction with oxygen. The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol, and the reaction forming CuO is Cu + 1/2 O2 -> CuO, so 0.80 g of CuO corresponds to 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol of O2. The remaining gas, 2.24 liters at STP, is likely N2, as it is non-reactive and would not be absorbed or reacted in the tubes. 2.24 liters of N2 at STP is 0.10 mol (since 1 mol of gas at STP occupies 22.4 liters). Therefore, the gases absorbed or reacted are 0.20 mol of H2O in tube \u21161, no gas in tube \u21162, and 0.05 mol of O2 in tube \u21163, with 0.10 mol of N2 remaining. This interpretation assumes that the weight changes are solely due to the specified reactions and that no other gases or reactions are involved.; answer - The gases absorbed or reacted are 0.20 mol of H2O in tube \u21161, no gas in tube \u21162, and 0.05 mol of O2 in tube \u21163, with 0.10 mol of N2 remaining.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3, we know that the remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.10 mol of gas (since 1 mol of gas at STP occupies 22.4 liters). The gases that were absorbed or reacted in the tubes were 0.20 mol of H2O in tube \u21161 and 0.05 mol of O2 in tube \u21163. Tube \u21162 showed no weight change, indicating no CO2 was present. The remaining gas C did not react with any of the tubes, suggesting it is an inert or non-reactive gas. Given the context and the fact that the remaining gas is 0.10 mol, it is likely to be N2, which is a common non-reactive gas. Therefore, the composition of the remaining gas C is pure N2, and its molar quantity is 0.10 mol.; answer - The remaining gas C is pure N2, with a molar quantity of 0.10 mol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine the molecular formulas of salts A and B, we need to consider the gases produced, their molar amounts, and the condition that the salts are equimolar. The mixture of salts weighed 7.20 g, and the gases produced were 0.20 mol of H2O, 0.05 mol of O2, and 0.10 mol of N2. The weight increase in tube \u21161 indicates the presence of water, suggesting that one of the salts might be a hydrate. The weight increase in tube \u21163 due to CuO formation suggests that one of the salts released oxygen. The lack of weight change in tube \u21162 indicates no CO2 was produced, ruling out carbonates. The remaining gas being N2 suggests that one of the salts contained nitrogen, possibly as an ammonium salt. Considering these observations, salt A could be an ammonium salt like NH4NO3, which decomposes to release N2, O2, and H2O. Salt B could be a hydrate like CaSO4\u00b72H2O, which releases water upon heating. These choices are consistent with the equimolar mixture condition as both salts would contribute equally to the observed gases. Therefore, the molecular formulas of salts A and B are NH4NO3 and CaSO4\u00b72H2O, respectively.; answer - The molecular formulas of salts A and B are NH4NO3 and CaSO4\u00b72H2O, respectively.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To calculate the total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B, we need to consider the molecular formulas NH4NO3 and CaSO4\u00b72H2O. For NH4NO3, the number of atoms is: N (2) + H (4) + O (3) = 9 atoms. For CaSO4\u00b72H2O, the number of atoms is: Ca (1) + S (1) + O (4) + H (4) + O (2) = 13 atoms. Adding these together gives 9 + 13 = 22 atoms in total.; answer - 22\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The calculated total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B is 22. The multiple-choice options provided are 15, 13, 17, and 19. None of these options match the calculated total of 22 atoms. Therefore, there is no correct answer choice among the given options.; answer - None"

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The equimolar mixture of salts A and B has a total mass of 7.20 g. Since the mixture is equimolar, the number of moles of salt A is equal to the number of moles of salt B. Let the molar masses of salts A and B be M_A and M_B, respectively. If n is the number of moles of each salt, then the total mass is given by: n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g, which simplifies to n(M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g. Therefore, the total moles of the mixture is n = 7.20 g / (M_A + M_B). The actual molar masses will be determined from other information provided, such as the gases formed and the changes in mass of the tubes.; answer - 7.20 g / (M_A + M_B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem provides information about the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B at 200\u00b0C, resulting in gases that pass through a series of tubes. Tube \u21161 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water vapor, and its mass increases by 3.60 g, indicating 3.60 g of water was formed. Tube \u21163 with red-hot copper reacts with oxygen to form CuO, and its mass increases by 0.80 g, corresponding to 0.80 g of oxygen. Tube \u21162 with Ca(OH)2 solution does not change in mass, indicating no CO2 was formed. The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). The total mass of gases absorbed by tubes \u21161 and \u21163 is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g, leaving 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g for gas C. This suggests that gas C is a single component, as its mass and moles are consistent. The gases formed are water (H2O), oxygen (O2), and another gas C. The number of moles of each gas can be calculated: 3.60 g of H2O is 0.2 moles (since molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol), 0.80 g of O2 is 0.025 moles (since molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol), and 0.1 moles of gas C. The decomposition process involves the release of these gases, but without additional information, we cannot identify the exact salts or gases. The decomposition is likely a combination of dehydration and release of other gases.; answer - The gases formed are 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of gas C, with a total mass of 4.40 g absorbed by tubes and 2.80 g for gas C.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The experimental setup involves three tubes: Tube \u21161 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, Tube \u21162 with Ca(OH)2 solution, and Tube \u21163 with red-hot copper. The increase in mass of Tube \u21161 by 3.60 g indicates the absorption of water vapor, as Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant. The mass increase corresponds to 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles of H2O. Tube \u21162 shows no change in mass, indicating no CO2 was absorbed, as Ca(OH)2 would react with CO2 to form CaCO3. Tube \u21163's mass increase by 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO from the reaction of copper with oxygen. The mass increase corresponds to 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 moles of O atoms, or 0.025 moles of O2 gas, since each O2 molecule contains two O atoms. The remaining gas C, with a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, corresponds to 0.1 moles, as 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP. The gases involved are H2O, O2, and gas C, with the moles calculated based on the mass changes and gas volume. The analysis assumes that the only gases involved are H2O, O2, and gas C, without considering other possible gases that might not have been absorbed or reacted in the tubes. Additionally, it does not account for the possibility of other reactions occurring in the tubes that might affect the mass changes.; answer - The gases involved are 0.2 moles of H2O absorbed in Tube \u21161, 0.025 moles of O2 reacted in Tube \u21163, and 0.1 moles of gas C remaining.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From sub-task 3, we know that the remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles of gas (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). The experimental setup involved passing the gases through three tubes: Tube \u21161 absorbed 0.2 moles of H2O, Tube \u21162 did not absorb any CO2 (as there was no mass change), and Tube \u21163 reacted with 0.025 moles of O2. Since the remaining gas C is 0.1 moles and was not absorbed or reacted in any of the tubes, it must be a gas that does not react with Mg(ClO4)2, Ca(OH)2, or copper. Given the setup, a likely candidate for gas C is a noble gas or a gas that does not react under these conditions. However, since the problem involves salts A and B decomposing to form gases, a more likely candidate is a simple diatomic gas like N2, which is inert under these conditions. Therefore, the remaining gas C is likely N2, with a molar amount of 0.1 moles.; answer - The remaining gas C is likely N2, with a molar amount of 0.1 moles.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine the molecular formulas of salts A and B, we need to consider the decomposition reactions and the stoichiometric constraints provided. The salts decompose to produce 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The equimolar condition implies that salts A and B decompose in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g. The increase in mass in Tube \u21161 (3.60 g) corresponds to the absorption of 0.2 moles of H2O, and the increase in Tube \u21163 (0.80 g) corresponds to the formation of 0.025 moles of O2. Since Tube \u21162 shows no change, no CO2 is produced. The remaining gas, N2, is 0.1 moles. Given these constraints, we can infer that the decomposition reactions are likely: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue. This satisfies the stoichiometric equations: 1 + 1 = 0.2 (H2O moles), 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.025 (O2 moles), 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.1 (N2 moles). The total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15, as determined from the previous analysis. Therefore, the molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with these decomposition reactions.; answer - The molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with the decomposition reactions: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From the analysis in Sub-task 5, we have determined that salts A and B decompose to produce 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The equimolar mixture implies that the decomposition reactions for A and B are similar and occur in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, and the mass increases in the tubes correspond to the absorption of H2O and the formation of CuO. The decomposition reactions can be represented as: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue. Solving the stoichiometric equations, we find that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15, which is consistent with the experimental data and constraints. Therefore, the molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with these decomposition reactions.; answer - The molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with the decomposition reactions: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From Sub-task 6, we have determined that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15. This conclusion was reached by analyzing the decomposition reactions and the stoichiometric equations derived from the experimental data. The equimolar mixture of salts A and B decomposes to produce specific amounts of gases, and the total mass of the salts is 7.20 g. The decomposition reactions suggest that each salt contributes to the formation of H2O, O2, and N2, and the total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B is consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B is 15.; answer - 15\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - The calculated total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B is 15, as determined in Sub-task 7.
