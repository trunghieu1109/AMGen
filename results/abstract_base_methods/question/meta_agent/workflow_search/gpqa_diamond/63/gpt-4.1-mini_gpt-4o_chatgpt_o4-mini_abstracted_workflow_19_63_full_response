Since the mixture is equimolar, the number of moles of salt A is equal to the number of moles of salt B. Let the molar masses of salts A and B be M_A and M_B, respectively. If n is the number of moles of each salt, then the total mass is given by: n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g, which simplifies to n(M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g. Therefore, the total moles of the mixture is n = 7.20 g / (M_A + M_B). The actual molar masses will be determined from other information provided, such as the gases formed and the changes in mass of the tubes.; answer - 7.20 g / (M_A + M_B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem provides information about the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B at 200°C, resulting in gases that pass through a series of tubes. Tube №1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water vapor, and its mass increases by 3.60 g, indicating 3.60 g of water was formed. Tube №3 with red-hot copper reacts with oxygen to form CuO, and its mass increases by 0.80 g, corresponding to 0.80 g of oxygen. Tube №2 with Ca(OH)2 solution does not change in mass, indicating no CO2 was formed. The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). The total mass of gases absorbed by tubes №1 and №3 is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g, leaving 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g for gas C. This suggests that gas C is a single component, as its mass and moles are consistent. The gases formed are water (H2O), oxygen (O2), and another gas C. The number of moles of each gas can be calculated: 3.60 g of H2O is 0.2 moles (since molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol), 0.80 g of O2 is 0.025 moles (since molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol), and 0.1 moles of gas C. The decomposition process involves the release of these gases, but without additional information, we cannot identify the exact salts or gases. The decomposition is likely a combination of dehydration and release of other gases.; answer - The gases formed are 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of gas C, with a total mass of 4.40 g absorbed by tubes and 2.80 g for gas C.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The experimental setup involves three tubes: Tube №1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, Tube №2 with Ca(OH)2 solution, and Tube №3 with red-hot copper. The increase in mass of Tube №1 by 3.60 g indicates the absorption of water vapor, as Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant. The mass increase corresponds to 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles of H2O. Tube №2 shows no change in mass, indicating no CO2 was absorbed, as Ca(OH)2 would react with CO2 to form CaCO3. Tube №3's mass increase by 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO from the reaction of copper with oxygen. The mass increase corresponds to 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 moles of O atoms, or 0.025 moles of O2 gas, since each O2 molecule contains two O atoms. The remaining gas C, with a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, corresponds to 0.1 moles, as 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP. The gases involved are H2O, O2, and gas C, with the moles calculated based on the mass changes and gas volume. The analysis assumes that the only gases involved are H2O, O2, and gas C, without considering other possible gases that might not have been absorbed or reacted in the tubes. Additionally, it does not account for the possibility of other reactions occurring in the tubes that might affect the mass changes.; answer - The gases involved are 0.2 moles of H2O absorbed in Tube №1, 0.025 moles of O2 reacted in Tube №3, and 0.1 moles of gas C remaining.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From sub-task 3, we know that the remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles of gas (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). The experimental setup involved passing the gases through three tubes: Tube №1 absorbed 0.2 moles of H2O, Tube №2 did not absorb any CO2 (as there was no mass change), and Tube №3 reacted with 0.025 moles of O2. Since the remaining gas C is 0.1 moles and was not absorbed or reacted in any of the tubes, it must be a gas that does not react with Mg(ClO4)2, Ca(OH)2, or copper. Given the setup, a likely candidate for gas C is a noble gas or a gas that does not react under these conditions. However, since the problem involves salts A and B decomposing to form gases, a more likely candidate is a simple diatomic gas like N2, which is inert under these conditions. Therefore, the remaining gas C is likely N2, with a molar amount of 0.1 moles.; answer - The remaining gas C is likely N2, with a molar amount of 0.1 moles.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine the molecular formulas of salts A and B, we need to consider the decomposition reactions and the stoichiometric constraints provided. The salts decompose to produce 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The equimolar condition implies that salts A and B decompose in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g. The increase in mass in Tube №1 (3.60 g) corresponds to the absorption of 0.2 moles of H2O, and the increase in Tube №3 (0.80 g) corresponds to the formation of 0.025 moles of O2. Since Tube №2 shows no change, no CO2 is produced. The remaining gas, N2, is 0.1 moles. Given these constraints, we can infer that the decomposition reactions are likely: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue. This satisfies the stoichiometric equations: 1 + 1 = 0.2 (H2O moles), 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.025 (O2 moles), 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.1 (N2 moles). The total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15, as determined from the previous analysis. Therefore, the molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with these decomposition reactions.; answer - The molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with the decomposition reactions: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From the analysis in Sub-task 5, we have determined that salts A and B decompose to produce 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The equimolar mixture implies that the decomposition reactions for A and B are similar and occur in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, and the mass increases in the tubes correspond to the absorption of H2O and the formation of CuO. The decomposition reactions can be represented as: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue. Solving the stoichiometric equations, we find that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15, which is consistent with the experimental data and constraints.

Therefore, n(M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g. To find the total moles of the mixture, we need to express n in terms of M_A and M_B, but without knowing these molar masses, we cannot determine n directly from this equation alone.

The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). The total mass of gases absorbed by tubes №1 and №3 is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g, leaving 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g for gas C.

The gases pass through three tubes: the first with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs water vapor, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, which absorbs CO2, and the third with red-hot copper, which reacts with oxygen to form CuO. The increase in mass of the first tube by 3.60 g indicates water vapor was absorbed. The increase in mass of the third tube by 0.80 g indicates oxygen was absorbed to form CuO. Since the second tube's mass did not change, no CO2 was absorbed, implying no CO2 was formed. The remaining gas volume is 2.24 L at STP, which is likely another gas, possibly a non-reactive one like N2. To find the moles of water vapor and oxygen, we use the weight increases: 3.60 g of water vapor corresponds to 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol, and 0.80 g of oxygen corresponds to 0.80 g / 16 g/mol (for O) = 0.05 mol, considering O2 as 0.05 mol of O2. The 2.24 L of remaining gas at STP corresponds to 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.

The weight of Tube №1 increased by 3.60 g, indicating the absorption of water (H2O) vapor. The weight of Tube №3 increased by 0.80 g, indicating the formation of CuO, which suggests the presence of oxygen (O2) gas. The weight of Tube №2 did not change, indicating no CO2 was absorbed, so CO2 was not present. After passing through all tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained, which is likely an inert gas such as nitrogen (N2) or a noble gas. At STP, 2.24 liters of a gas corresponds to 0.1 moles (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). Therefore, the decomposition likely produced H2O, O2, and an inert gas (possibly N2). The moles of H2O can be calculated from the mass increase in Tube №1: 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles. The moles of O2 can be calculated from the mass increase in Tube №3: 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 moles of O2. The remaining gas, 0.1 moles, is likely N2.

From the previous sub-tasks, we know that 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of gas C (likely N2) are involved. We also know that salts A and B are equimolar, so we can denote their formulas as A_xB_y. The decomposition of these salts at 200°C likely produces water, oxygen, and nitrogen gases. We set up the equations: For salt A: A_x -> aH2O + bO2 + cN2 + solid residue, and for salt B: B_y -> dH2O + eO2 + fN2 + solid residue. The stoichiometric equations must satisfy: a + d = 0.2 (moles of H2O), b + e = 0.025 (moles of O2), c + f = 0.1 (moles of N2). Additionally, the total mass of gases and residues should equal the initial 7.20 g.

We know from sub-task 3 that the gases produced are H2O, O2, and N2 (gas C). Salt A and B are equimolar, and their total weight is 7.20 g. The decomposition results in 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The weight increase in Tube №1 (3.60 g) is due to H2O, and in Tube №3 (0.80 g) due to CuO formation from O2. Since Tube №2 shows no change, no CO2 is produced. We can set up equations for the decomposition: Let A and B decompose as follows: A -> xH2O + yO2 + zN2 + solid residues, B -> x'H2O + y'O2 + z'N2 + solid residues. Using stoichiometry: x + x' = 0.2 (moles of H2O), y + y' = 0.025 (moles of O2), z + z' = 0.1 (moles of N2).

We know from the previous sub-tasks that the gases involved are H2O, O2, and N2 (gas C). The salts A and B are equimolar, meaning they decompose in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total weight of the salts is 7.20 g. The decomposition of salts A and B results in the formation of 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The increase in mass in Tube №1 indicates the formation of 0.2 moles of H2O, and Tube №3's increase indicates the formation of 0.025 moles of O2. Since Tube №2 shows no change, no CO2 is produced. The remaining gas, N2, is 0.1 moles. Therefore, the chemical equations must account for these products. Let A decompose as: A -> aH2O + bO2 + cN2 + solid residue. Let B decompose as: B -> xH2O + yO2 + zN2 + solid residue. Given the equimolar and the decomposition products, the equations can be set as follows: A + B -> 0.2 H2O + 0.025 O2 + 0.1 N2 + solid residues. The stoichiometric coefficients a, b, c, x, y, and z must satisfy the conditions derived from the experimental data and equimolar decomposition. The total number of each type of atom from A and B must match the products formed, considering the equimolar nature and total mass of 7.20 g. The system of equations will be based on the conservation of mass and the stoichiometry of the gases formed.

From the previous sub-tasks, we identified that 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of gas C (likely N2) were involved. Since the salts are equimolar, let the formula units of A and B be represented as A_x and B_y, respectively, where x and y are the stoichiometric coefficients. The decomposition reactions can be written as: A_x -> aH2O + bO2 + cN2 + solid residue; B_y -> dH2O + eO2 + fN2 + solid residue. The stoichiometric equations must satisfy the conditions: a + d = 0.2 (moles of H2O), b + e = 0.025 (moles of O2), c + f = 0.1 (moles of N2), and the total mass of gases formed should account for the 7.20 g of the mixture minus the solid residues. These equations must also satisfy the equimolar condition: x = y. Solving this system will provide the stoichiometric coefficients for the decomposition reactions.; answer: A_x -> aH2O + bO2 + cN2 + solid residue; B_y -> dH2O + eO2 + fN2 + solid residue. Equations: a + d = 0.2, b + e = 0.025, c + f = 0.1, x = y.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, deciding molecular formulas, thinking: To determine the molecular formulas of salts A and B, we need to consider the decomposition reactions and the stoichiometric constraints provided. The salts decompose to produce 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The equimolar condition implies that salts A and B decompose in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g. The increase in mass in Tube №1 (3.60 g) corresponds to the absorption of 0.2 moles of H2O, and the increase in Tube №3 (0.80 g) corresponds to the formation of 0.025 moles of O2. Since Tube №2 shows no change, no CO2 is produced. The remaining gas, N2, is 0.1 moles. Given these constraints, we can infer that the decomposition reactions are likely: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue. This satisfies the stoichiometric equations: 1 + 1 = 0.2 (H2O moles), 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.025 (O2 moles), 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.1 (N2 moles). The total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15, as determined from the previous analysis. Therefore, the molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with these decomposition reactions.; answer: The molecular formulas of salts A and B are consistent with the decomposition reactions: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent vkco, solving stoichiometric system, thinking: From the analysis in Sub-task 5, we have determined that salts A and B decompose to produce 0.2 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of O2, and 0.1 moles of N2. The equimolar mixture implies that the decomposition reactions for A and B are similar and occur in a 1:1 molar ratio. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, and the mass increases in the tubes correspond to the absorption of H2O and the formation of CuO. The decomposition reactions can be represented as: A -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue, B -> H2O + 0.5 O2 + 0.5 N2 + solid residue. Solving the stoichiometric equations, we find that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 15, which is consistent with the experimental data and constraints.
