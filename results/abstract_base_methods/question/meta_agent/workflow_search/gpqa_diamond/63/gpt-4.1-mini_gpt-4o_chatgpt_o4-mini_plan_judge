Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_19_63
proposed answer: The calculated total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B is 22. The multiple-choice options provided are 15, 13, 17, and 19. None of these options match the calculated total of 22 atoms. Therefore, there is no correct answer choice among the given options.

Answer:None

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_19_63
proposed answer: The calculated total number of atoms in the combined formula units of salts A and B is 15, as determined in Sub-task 7. The multiple-choice options provided are 15, 13, 17, and 19. Since 15 is one of the options, it is an exact match. Therefore, the closest valid answer choice is the one corresponding to 15.
