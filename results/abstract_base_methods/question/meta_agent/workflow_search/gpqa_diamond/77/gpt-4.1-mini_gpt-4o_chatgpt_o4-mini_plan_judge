proposed answer: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge account for the finite speed of light and the retarded time effects. The correct expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A involve the retarded position and velocity of the charge, with the denominator (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) ensuring the correct propagation delay. Choice 2 matches these derived expressions, as it includes the correct form of the potentials with the appropriate constants and vector dependencies. The other choices do not match the derived expressions, either due to incorrect denominators or missing factors. Therefore, based on the consistency with the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials, Choice 2 is the correct answer.

proposed answer: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge are given by the expressions: V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})} and \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}. These expressions account for the retardation effect due to the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge. Comparing these with the given choices, choice 2 matches exactly with these expressions. Choice 1 and choice 3 do not account for the retardation effect and have incorrect forms for the potentials. Choice 4 has a sign error in the denominator, which should be (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v}) instead of (d c + \vec{d}. \vec{v}). Therefore, the correct choice is choice 2.
