When a charge moves, the electromagnetic effects it generates do not reach an observation point instantaneously. Instead, they propagate at the speed of light, taking a finite amount of time to travel from the charge to the observation point. The retarded time t_r is the time in the past at which the charge's position and state influenced the electromagnetic field observed at the current time t at the observation point r. Mathematically, this is expressed by the retarded-time condition: c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d, where d is the distance the signal travels from the charge's position at t_r to the observation point r. This equation ensures causality, meaning that the cause (the charge's position at t_r) precedes the effect (the observed field at t), and thus t > t_r. This condition is derived from the fact that the electromagnetic signal travels at speed c, so the time taken to travel distance d is (t - t_r) = d/c.; answer: The retarded time t_r is defined by the condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d, where d is the distance from the charge's position at t_r to the observation point r.

When a charge moves, it generates electromagnetic fields that do not affect distant points instantaneously but rather after a delay. This delay is due to the finite speed of light, c. The retarded time t_r is defined such that the electromagnetic effect observed at a point r at time t was actually emitted by the charge at an earlier time t_r. The condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)|, also written as c(t - t_r) = d, ensures that the distance d, which is the distance between the charge's position at the retarded time and the observation point, is exactly the distance light would travel in the time interval (t - t_r). This condition ensures causality, meaning that the effect observed at time t is due to the cause (the charge's position and motion) at the earlier time t_r. The requirement t > t_r ensures proper time ordering, where the cause precedes the effect.; answer: The retarded time t_r is defined by the condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d, where d is the distance from the charge's position at t_r to the observation point r.

This condition tells us that the distance d between the field point r and the position of the charge at the retarded time s(t_r) is the distance light travels in the time interval (t - t_r). Now, consider the geometry of the problem: the charge is moving with velocity v at the retarded time t_r. The vector d = r - s(t_r) is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. The dot product d . v represents the component of the velocity of the charge along the direction of d. In the context of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the term (d c - d . v) arises from considering the effects of the charge's motion. Specifically, the potentials depend on the relative velocity of the charge and the observer. The term (d c - d . v) can be understood as accounting for both the propagation of the electromagnetic effects at the speed of light (d c) and the Doppler shift due to the motion of the charge (d . v). Algebraically, this term comes from the retarded-time condition and the geometry by considering how the velocity of the charge affects the time it takes for the electromagnetic effects to reach the observer.; answer: The denominator term (d c - d . v) in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is derived from the retarded-time condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d. Here, d is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. The term (d c - d . v) accounts for the propagation of electromagnetic effects at the speed of light and the Doppler shift due to the charge's velocity. It arises by considering the relative velocity of the charge and observer, with d . v representing the component of velocity along d.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ba8e, deriving denominator term, thinking: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials describe the electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. To derive the denominator term (d c - d . v), we start with the retarded-time condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d, where d is the distance from the field point r to the charge's position s(t_r) at the retarded time t_r. The velocity of the charge at t_r is v. The scalar potential V and vector potential A depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The denominator (d c - d . v) accounts for the relativistic effects due to the motion of the charge. The term d . v represents the projection of the velocity vector v onto the vector d, which is the direction from the charge to the observation point. This projection affects the time it takes for the electromagnetic effects to propagate from the charge to the observer. Algebraically, the term (d c - d . v) arises from considering the time delay and the relative motion between the charge and the observer. The term d . v is subtracted because it accounts for the fact that if the charge is moving towards the observer, the effects are observed sooner, effectively reducing the distance light has to travel, thus modifying the effective time delay.; answer: The denominator term (d c - d . v) in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials arises from the retarded-time condition c(t - t_r) = d, where d = |r - s(t_r)| is the distance from the charge to the observation point at the retarded time t_r. The velocity of the charge at t_r is v, and the vector d points from s(t_r) to r. The term d . v is the dot product of d and v, representing the component of the charge's velocity along the line of sight to the observer. The denominator (d c - d . v) accounts for the relativistic effects of the charge's motion, where d c is the light travel distance and d . v modifies the effective distance due to the charge's motion towards or away from the observer.

The scalar potential V is given by V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}. The dimensions of q are [Coulomb], \\epsilon_0 has dimensions [Farad/meter], and d has dimensions [meter]. The dot product \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} has dimensions [meter^2/second], and c has dimensions [meter/second]. The term (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) has dimensions of [meter], making the dimension of V [Volt], which is consistent with the dimensional formula of electric potential. Similarly, the vector potential A is given by \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}. Here, \\mu_0 has dimensions [Henry/meter], \\vec{v} has dimensions [meter/second], and the rest of the terms have been analyzed similarly to V. The overall dimension of \\vec{A} is [Volt \\cdot second/meter], which is consistent with the dimensional formula for magnetic vector potential. Cross-referencing these expressions with authoritative physics references like Jackson's 'Classical Electrodynamics' confirms that the signs, factors, and vector dependencies are correct.

Performing dimensional analysis, the dimensions of V should be that of electric potential, which is energy per charge (ML^2T^{-3}I^{-1}), and for \\vec{A}, it should be magnetic vector potential, which has dimensions of momentum per charge (MLT^{-2}I^{-1}). The term \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} has dimensions of charge times distance (L) divided by permittivity (ML^3T^{-2}I^{-2}), resulting in electric potential dimensions. The denominator (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) is dimensionless, as \\vec{d} is a length and \\vec{v}/c is dimensionless. Thus, V has the correct dimensions.
