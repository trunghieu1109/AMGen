The retarded time t_r is the time at which the electromagnetic effects observed at r were generated by the charge at its past position. The vector d is defined as the difference between the observation point r and the position of the charge at the retarded time, s(t_r), i.e., d = r - s(t_r). The magnitude of this vector, denoted as d, is the Euclidean distance between these two points, calculated as the norm |d|.

When a charge moves, it generates electromagnetic fields that propagate outward at the speed of light, c. The retarded time t_r is the time at which an event (such as a change in the charge's position) occurred, whose effects are observed at a later time t at a different point in space. The condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d expresses this relationship: the distance d between the observation point r and the charge's position s(t_r) at the retarded time is equal to the distance light travels in the time interval (t - t_r). This ensures causality, as it implies that the effects observed at time t are due to events that occurred at the earlier time t_r, consistent with the finite speed of light. The condition t > t_r ensures that the observation occurs after the event, maintaining the correct time ordering.; answer - The retarded time t_r is defined such that the electromagnetic effects observed at time t at position r are due to the charge's position at the earlier time t_r. Mathematically, this is expressed by the condition c(t - t_r) = |r - s(t_r)| = d, where d is the distance between the observation point r and the charge's position at the retarded time s(t_r).
