Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_20
proposed answer: All agents agree that from Sub-task 2, benzoquinone is the compound that does not exhibit tautomerism. From Sub-task 4, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that exhibits optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct choice must have A as benzoquinone and B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Among the given options, choice 3 ('A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate') matches both criteria. Thus, the correct answer is choice C.
