For tautomerism to occur, the compound must have a hydrogen atom that can be easily transferred and a suitable site for the formation of a double bond. Benzoquinone is a compound with a stable quinone structure and does not have the necessary hydrogen atom or structural features to undergo tautomerism. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has keto groups that can potentially participate in keto-enol tautomerism, where a hydrogen atom can shift to form an enol structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can.; answer - Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it lacks the structural features necessary for tautomerism, such as a hydrogen atom that can be transferred and a site for double bond formation.
