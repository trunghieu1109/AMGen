The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ^2 - (ħ^2/4). Setting this equal to zero gives λ^2 = ħ^2/4, so λ = ±ħ/2. The eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. To find the eigenvectors, we solve (A - λI)v = 0 for each eigenvalue. For λ = ħ/2, the matrix becomes [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]], leading to the equation -ħ/2 x + ħ/2 y = 0, which simplifies to x = y. A normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>).

First, we find A|alpha>: A|alpha> = A((1/sqrt(7))((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)) = (1/sqrt(7))(ħ/2(2-i)|up> + ħ/2(1+i)|down>). Next, we calculate ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩: ⟨alpha| = (1/sqrt(7))((1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|). Then, ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = (1/7)((1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|)(ħ/2(2-i)|up> + ħ/2(1+i)|down>) = (1/7)(ħ/2((1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i))) = (1/7)(ħ/2(5 + 5)) = (1/7)(ħ/2 * 10) = 5ħ/7.
