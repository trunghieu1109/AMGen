Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The task is to determine the correct sequence of reagents and the resulting product for the reaction of an enamine. The enamine undergoes deprotonation by LDA to form a carbanion, which then reacts with ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) to add an ethyl group. Finally, hydrolysis with H3O+ regenerates the carbonyl compound and releases the secondary amine. The correct sequence of reagents is: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. This matches choice3, where the product B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. Choice3 correctly identifies both the reagent order and the resulting products. All agents agree that choice3 is the correct answer.
