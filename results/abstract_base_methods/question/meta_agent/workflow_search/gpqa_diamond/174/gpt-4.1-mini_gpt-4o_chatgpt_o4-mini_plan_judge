Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: All agents agree that the fraction of maximum power radiated at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4. This is based on the angular dependence of the radiated power, which follows a sin^2(theta) pattern typical of dipole radiation. At theta = 30 degrees, sin^2(30 degrees) = 1/4. Additionally, the power-law form of the radiated power with respect to wavelength is lambda^(-4), which is consistent with the characteristics of dipole radiation where power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Therefore, the correct choice is 1/4, lambda^(-4).

Answer:1/4, \lambda^{-4}
