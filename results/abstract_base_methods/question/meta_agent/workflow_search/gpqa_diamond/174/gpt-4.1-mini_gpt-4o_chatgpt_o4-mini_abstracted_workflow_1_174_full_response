Therefore, the answer is consistent with choice 3.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Ah8z:\nFrom Sub-task 3, the fraction of maximum power radiated at theta = 30 degrees is determined to be 1/4. This is because the angular dependence of the radiated power follows a sin^2(theta) pattern, and at theta = 30 degrees, sin^2(30 degrees) = 1/4. From Sub-task 4, the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is given by lambda^(-4), which is typical for dipole radiation where the power radiated is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Combining these results, the fraction of maximum power radiated at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4, and the functional form of f(lambda, theta) is lambda^(-4).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wLM9:\nFrom Sub-task 3, we have determined that the fraction of maximum power A radiated at \\( \\theta = 30^\\circ \\) is \\( \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 1/4 \\). This is based on the assumption that the angular distribution of radiated power per unit solid angle follows a dipole-like pattern, where it is proportional to \\( \\sin^2(\\theta) \\).

This is derived from the angular dependence of the radiated power, which follows a dipole radiation pattern characterized by sin²(θ). At θ = 30°, sin²(30°) = 1/4, indicating that 1/4 of the maximum power is radiated at this angle. From Sub-task 4, the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is given by λ⁻⁴, which is consistent with the behavior of dipole radiation where the power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Therefore, combining these results, the fraction of maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and the functional form of f(λ, θ) is λ⁻⁴ sin²(θ).
