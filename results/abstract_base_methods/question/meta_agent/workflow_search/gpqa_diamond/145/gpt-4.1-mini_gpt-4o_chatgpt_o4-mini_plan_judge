Question: Example(question='5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What is the major product?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: All agents agree that the major product of the Diels-Alder reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride has the stereochemistry (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r). This is based on the endo preference of the Diels-Alder reaction and the influence of the fluorine substituent, which directs the stereochemical outcome. Among the given choices, choice1 matches this stereochemical configuration: (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Therefore, choice1 is the correct answer.
