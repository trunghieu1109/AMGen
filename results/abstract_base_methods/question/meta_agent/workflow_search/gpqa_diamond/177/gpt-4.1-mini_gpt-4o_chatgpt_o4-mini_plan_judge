proposed answer: All agents have consistently determined that the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1 and that the theory is not renormalizable. This conclusion is based on the fact that a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant indicates non-renormalizability according to the canonical criterion. Among the provided multiple-choice options, choice 3 states: 'The mass dimension \( \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.', which matches the conclusions from the sub-tasks. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 3.
