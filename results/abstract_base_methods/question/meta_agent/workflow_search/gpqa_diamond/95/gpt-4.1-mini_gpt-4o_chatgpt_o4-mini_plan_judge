Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole is S = 4πkGM^2/(hc), which shows that the entropy is proportional to the square of the mass of the black hole. For a supermassive black hole, the mass is extremely large, leading to a very high entropy. The options provided are 10^59 J/K, 10^65 J/K, 10^62 J/K, and 10^66 J/K. Based on the typical mass of supermassive black holes and the calculations using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, the order of magnitude for the entropy is most consistent with 10^66 J/K. This is because supermassive black holes have masses on the order of millions to billions of solar masses, resulting in very high entropy values.

proposed answer: The entropy of a black hole is calculated using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (k c^3 A) / (4 G ħ), where A is the area of the event horizon. The area A is given by A = 4π R_s^2, where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius can be derived from the angular size θ and distance d to the black hole using the formula R_s = d * θ. Given θ = 10^-17 degrees and d = 10^10 parsecs, we convert θ to radians and calculate R_s. The large distance and small angular size result in a large Schwarzschild radius, leading to a large area A. Substituting the constants and the calculated area into the entropy formula, the order of magnitude of the entropy is found to be 10^66 J/K. This matches choice D), which is consistent with the scale of a supermassive black hole.
