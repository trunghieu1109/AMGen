The absorbed energy is indeed higher than the emission energy, which is consistent with the concept of Stokes shift where absorbed energy is higher than emitted energy. The absorbed energy of 2.5393 eV corresponds to a shorter wavelength than the emitted light, which is approximately 530.5 nm (green light). The absorbed energy of 2.5393 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 488 nm, which is in the blue region of the spectrum.

However, the limitation is that it assumes a specific Stokes shift value without justification, and it does not consider other possible factors that could affect the absorption and emission wavelengths, such as solvent effects or specific molecular interactions.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Perform a consistency check to verify that the absorbed photon energy is higher than the emission energy and that the selected absorbed color is physically plausible.
