Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_39_155
proposed answer: The combined product mixture from the reactions consists of three distinct stereoisomers: (R,R)-diol, (S,S)-diol, and meso-diol. A chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers due to their different interactions with the chiral stationary phase. The (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol are enantiomers and will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso-diol, being achiral, will appear as a separate peak. Therefore, on a chiral HPLC column, we expect to see three distinct peaks corresponding to the (R,R)-diol, (S,S)-diol, and meso-diol.

Answer:3 peaks on chiral HPLC

proposed answer: Based on the sub-task answers, we have determined that on a standard HPLC column, there are 2 peaks because enantiomers co-elute and the meso compound is separate. On a chiral HPLC column, there are 3 peaks because the enantiomers are resolved into separate peaks and the meso compound is a single peak. The multiple-choice option that corresponds to 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC is choice C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
