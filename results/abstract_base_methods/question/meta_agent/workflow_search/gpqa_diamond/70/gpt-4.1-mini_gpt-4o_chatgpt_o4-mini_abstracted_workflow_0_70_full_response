This means that if we have two planets with orbital periods T1 and T2 and corresponding semi-major axes a1 and a2, then (T1/T2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. From Sub-task 1, we know the periods: T2 (Planet_2) = 2 and T4 (Planet_4) = 3.5. Therefore, (2/3.5)^2 = (a2/a4)^3.

Therefore, for planets in circular orbits, the ratio of the orbital radii can be determined by taking the ratio of the orbital periods raised to the power of 2/3.

Mathematically, this is expressed as T^2 ∝ r^3. Therefore, if we have two planets with orbital periods T1 and T2, and corresponding orbital radii r1 and r2, the relationship can be expressed as (T1/T2)^2 = (r1/r2)^3. From Sub-task 1, we have the orbital periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 as 2 and 3.5 respectively. Thus, (2/3.5)^2 = (r2/r4)^3, where r2 and r4 are the orbital radii of Planet_2 and Planet_4 respectively. Solving for the ratio r4/r2, we get r4/r2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3).; answer: Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. For two planets, the ratio of their orbital periods squared is equal to the ratio of their orbital radii cubed: (T2/T4)^2 = (r2/r4)^3.
