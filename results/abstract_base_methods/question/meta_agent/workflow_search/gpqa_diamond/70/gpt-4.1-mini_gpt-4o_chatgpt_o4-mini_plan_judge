Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_70
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 using the temperature-radius relationship T_4/T_2 = (d_2/d_4)^(1/2). They found the ratio of orbital radii d_2/d_4 to be approximately 0.707, leading to a temperature ratio of T_4/T_2 â‰ˆ 0.841. This value is closest to the multiple-choice option ~0.83. Therefore, the consensus among the agents is that the closest matching choice is B) ~0.83.
