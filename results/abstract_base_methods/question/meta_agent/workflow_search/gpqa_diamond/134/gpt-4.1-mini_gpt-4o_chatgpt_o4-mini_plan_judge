proposed answer: The derived allowed decay channels for the boson X, which has a mass of 6 GeV, are X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, b\bar{b}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}. We need to compare this with the provided multiple-choice options. Choice 1 is missing the b\bar{b} channel. Choice 2 matches the derived channels exactly, including all the kinematically allowed decays and excluding any forbidden ones. Choice 3 incorrectly includes the t\bar{t} channel, which is not kinematically allowed due to the top quark's mass being greater than 6 GeV. Choice 4 is missing the c\bar{c} and \mu^{+}\mu^{-} channels. Therefore, Choice 2 is the only option that matches the derived decay channels completely.

proposed answer: The task is to determine which multiple-choice option matches the kinematically allowed decay channels of the boson X, given that its mass is 6 GeV. The allowed decay channels are: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}. We need to compare this list with each option:

- Choice 1: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}. This matches exactly with the allowed decay channels.
- Choice 2: X\rightarrow b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}. This includes b\bar{b}, which is not allowed due to its mass exceeding the kinematic limit.
- Choice 3: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},t\bar{t},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}. This includes t\bar{t}, which is forbidden as the top quark mass is much greater than 6 GeV.
- Choice 4: X\rightarrow b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}. This also includes b\bar{b}, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the correct choice that matches the allowed decay channels without including any forbidden channels is Choice 1.
