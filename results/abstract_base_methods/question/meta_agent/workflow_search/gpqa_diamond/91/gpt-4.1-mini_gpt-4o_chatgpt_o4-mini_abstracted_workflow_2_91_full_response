From Sub-task 4, we know the total enthalpy of atomization for all carbon atoms is 12000 kJ/mol. From Sub-task 3, the total bond energy of the molecule is 10400 kJ/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy of formation is calculated as follows: Enthalpy of formation = 12000 kJ/mol - 10400 kJ/mol = 1600 kJ/mol. This calculation accounts for the energy required to atomize the carbon atoms and the energy released when bonds are formed in the molecule.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent CFdf:\nTo find the enthalpy of formation of the molecule, we need to use the formula: Enthalpy of formation = (Sum of enthalpy of atomization of atoms) - (Sum of bond energies in the molecule).
