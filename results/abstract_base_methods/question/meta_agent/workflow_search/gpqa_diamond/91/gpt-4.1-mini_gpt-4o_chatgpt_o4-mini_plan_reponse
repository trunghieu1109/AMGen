To determine the number of each type of bond, we need to consider the structure:\n\n1. (CH3)2C=CH: This part has 2 C-H bonds from each CH3 group (6 C-H bonds) and 1 C=C bond. It also has 1 C-C bond between the central carbon and the CH group.\n2. CH2-CH(CH3): This part has 2 C-H bonds from the CH2 group and 3 C-H bonds from the CH3 group (5 C-H bonds total).

From Sub-task 1, we determined that the molecule has 12 carbon atoms. To find the total enthalpy of atomization for all carbon atoms, we multiply the number of carbon atoms by the enthalpy of atomization per carbon atom.
