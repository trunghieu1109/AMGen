Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pxsV', content='To validate that no prime smaller than 5 admits an integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1, we check the primes 2 and 3.

For p = 3, we check n = 1 and n = 2, finding that n^4 + 1 = 2 and 17 respectively, neither of which is divisible by 9. Therefore, no primes smaller than 5 work.
