Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: To validate that the selected prime p = 5 is indeed the least prime for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides (n^4 + 1), we need to check all primes less than 5. The primes less than 5 are 2 and 3. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 9. Since neither 2 nor 3 satisfies the condition, and we have already established that for p = 5, n = 2 gives us 17, which is not divisible by 25, but for p = 13, n = 3 gives us 82, which is divisible by 169. However, since we are looking for the least prime, we confirm that 5 is indeed the least prime that satisfies the condition, as no smaller primes work. Therefore, the least prime p is 5.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_4
proposed answer: To validate that no prime smaller than 5 admits an integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1, we check the primes 2 and 3. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4 for any integer n, as n^4 is always even and thus n^4 + 1 is odd. For p = 3, we check n = 1 and n = 2, finding that n^4 + 1 = 2 and 17 respectively, neither of which is divisible by 9. Therefore, no primes smaller than 5 work. Now, for p = 5, we need to find the least positive integer m such that 25 divides m^4 + 1. Testing m = 2 through m = 9, we find that none yield a result divisible by 25. However, testing m = 10, we find 10^4 + 1 = 10001, which is divisible by 25. Thus, the least positive integer m such that 25 divides m^4 + 1 is 10.
