Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Define variables and formal relationships to represent the problem. \\n\\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 31nD:\\nTo analyze the problem, we define the number of vertices in the octagon as n = 8. Each vertex can be colored either red (R) or blue (B) independently with equal probability, which means each vertex has a probability of 1/2 for being red and 1/2 for being blue. We denote the number of blue vertices as k, where k can range from 0 to 8. The condition that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices occupy the positions of the original red vertices implies that the configuration of blue vertices must be such that it can be mapped to a configuration of red vertices through rotation. This means that the blue vertices must form a pattern that is invariant under the rotations of the octagon. We can use combinatorial reasoning and group theory (specifically Burnside\\\'s lemma) to count the valid configurations and calculate the probability. The final probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime integers, and we need to find m+n.\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 31nD:\\nm+n\\n\\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 2: Using the formal relationships from Subtask 1, consider all possible rotations and colorings, and calculate the probability that a rotation exists mapping blue vertices to original red vertices.
