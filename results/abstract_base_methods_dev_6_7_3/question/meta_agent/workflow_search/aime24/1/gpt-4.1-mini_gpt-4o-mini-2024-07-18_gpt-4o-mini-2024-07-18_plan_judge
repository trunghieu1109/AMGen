Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_1
proposed answer: The previous context provided the final result for m + n as 13, which is derived from the calculation of AP in the triangle inscribed in the circle. Since the problem asks for m + n as an integer, the answer is directly taken from the previous result.

Iteration: Test New Architecture_1
proposed answer: The reduced fraction for AP is 20/3. The integers m and n are 20 and 3 respectively. Therefore, m + n = 20 + 3 = 23.
