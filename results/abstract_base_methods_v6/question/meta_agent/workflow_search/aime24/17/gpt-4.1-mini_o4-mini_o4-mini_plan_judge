Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: We need the number of unordered triples {a,b,c} of nonnegative integers with a+b+c=300 and a^2b+a^2c+b^2a+b^2c+c^2a+c^2b=6,000,000. From previous analysis: The only ordered solutions are (100,100,100) and the six permutations of (200,100,0), giving seven ordered triples total. But as unordered (counting distinct multisets), these correspond to just two: {100,100,100} and {200,100,0}. Therefore the total number of valid triples up to symmetry is 2.

proposed answer: We revisit the derived count (7) and the explicit list of seven triples: (0,100,200), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (200,100,0), and (100,100,100). Each solution arises from one of two cases: exactly one zero or all equal. The factorized form under a+b+c=300 yields no other integer solutions. There is no overlap between cases and no missing pattern. Since the enumerated list exactly matches the counted total, internal consistency is confirmed and no ambiguity remains.

Answer:The total matches the enumeration: there are exactly 7 solutions and no ambiguity remains.
