Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Walking 9 km at speed s takes 9/s hours, coffee time is t minutes = t/60 hours. Total at speed s is given as 4 hours, so 9/s + t/60 = 4. At speed s+2, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours; total is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, so 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.; answer - Let s be Aya’s walking speed in km/h and t be her coffee shop time in minutes.

From Sub-task 2, the total times are 4 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. Therefore, for walking speed s, 9 kilometers takes 9/s hours, plus t/60 hours at the shop gives 4 hours. Similarly, at speed s+2, walking takes 9/(s+2) hours, plus the same t/60 hours gives 2.4 hours.

Let T = t/60. Then from the first equation T = 4 – 9/s. Substituting into the second gives:\n\n9/(s+2) + (4 – 9/s) = 2.4\n⟹ 9/(s+2) – 9/s = –1.6\nMultiply both sides by s(s+2):\n9s – 9(s+2) = –1.6·s(s+2)\n⟹ –18 = –1.6(s² + 2s)\n⟹ 18 = 1.6s² + 3.2s\n⟹ 8s² + 16s – 90 = 0  (multiplying by 5)\n⟹ 4s² + 8s – 45 = 0\nSolve: s = [–8 ± √(64 + 720)]/8 = [–8 ± 28]/8.

Walking 9 km at speed s takes 9/s hours, coffee time is t minutes = t/60 hours. Total at speed s is given as 4 hours, so 9/s + t/60 = 4.

From Sub-task 2, the total times are 4 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. Therefore, for walking speed s, 9 kilometers takes 9/s hours, plus t/60 hours at the shop gives 4 hours.

From the first, t = 60(4 – 9/s) = 240 – 540/s. From the second, t = 60(2.4 – 9/(s+2)) = 144 – 540/(s+2). Setting these equal gives 240 – 540/s = 144 – 540/(s+2), so 96 = 540(1/s – 1/(s+2)) = 1080/(s(s+2)). Hence s(s+2) = 1080/96 = 11.25, leading to 4s^2 + 8s – 45 = 0.
