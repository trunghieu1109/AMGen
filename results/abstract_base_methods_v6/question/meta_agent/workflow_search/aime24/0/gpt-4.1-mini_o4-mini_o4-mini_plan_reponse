        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

        "response": "From previous sub-tasks we determined Aya\u2019s walking speed s = 2.5 km/h and coffee-shop stop t = 24 minutes. At speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, the walking time for 9 km is 9 km \u00f7 3.0 km/h = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Adding the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop gives a total of 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nAnswer:204",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to define s and t, then write equations for total time (walking time + coffee shop time) at two speeds. Walking 9 km at speed s takes 9/s hours, coffee time is t minutes = t/60 hours. Total at speed s is given as 4 hours, so 9/s + t/60 = 4. At speed s+2, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours; total is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, so 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.; answer - Let s be Aya\u2019s walking speed in km/h and t be her coffee shop time in minutes. Then:\n1) 9/s + t/60 = 4\n2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To perform algebraic manipulation we need both total times in hours. 4 hours is already in hours, so it remains 4. 2 hours 24 minutes must be converted by adding 24/60 = 0.4 hours to 2, giving 2.4 hours.; answer - 4 hours = 4 hours; 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know from Sub-task 1 that the total time each morning is the walking time plus the coffee\u2010shop time t (in hours as t/60). From Sub-task 2, the total times are 4 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. Therefore, for walking speed s, 9 kilometers takes 9/s hours, plus t/60 hours at the shop gives 4 hours. Similarly, at speed s+2, walking takes 9/(s+2) hours, plus the same t/60 hours gives 2.4 hours. These become our two equations.; answer - 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have the system: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Let T = t/60. Then from the first equation T = 4 \u2013 9/s. Substituting into the second gives:\n\n9/(s+2) + (4 \u2013 9/s) = 2.4\n\u27f9 9/(s+2) \u2013 9/s = \u20131.6\nMultiply both sides by s(s+2):\n9s \u2013 9(s+2) = \u20131.6\u00b7s(s+2)\n\u27f9 \u201318 = \u20131.6(s\u00b2 + 2s)\n\u27f9 18 = 1.6s\u00b2 + 3.2s\n\u27f9 8s\u00b2 + 16s \u2013 90 = 0  (multiplying by 5)\n\u27f9 4s\u00b2 + 8s \u2013 45 = 0\nSolve: s = [\u20138 \u00b1 \u221a(64 + 720)]/8 = [\u20138 \u00b1 28]/8. The positive root is s = 20/8 = 2.5 km/h.\nThen T = 4 \u2013 9/2.5 = 4 \u2013 3.6 = 0.4 hours, so t = 0.4\u00d760 = 24 minutes.; answer - s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From earlier sub-tasks we found Aya\u2019s walking speed s = 2.5 km/h and coffee shop time t = 24 minutes. At speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, the time to walk 9 km is distance \u00f7 speed = 9 \u00f7 3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Adding the 24-minute coffee stop gives a total of 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.; answer - 204 minutes\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From previous sub-tasks we determined Aya\u2019s walking speed s = 2.5 km/h and coffee-shop stop t = 24 minutes. At speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, the walking time for 9 km is 9 km \u00f7 3.0 km/h = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Adding the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop gives a total of 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.; answer - 204"
