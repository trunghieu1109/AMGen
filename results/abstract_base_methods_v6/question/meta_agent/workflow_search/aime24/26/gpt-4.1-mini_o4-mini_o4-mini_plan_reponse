        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The sub-task asks to formalize the sets A and B and state the condition relating them. We know from the problem that A is Alice\u2019s chosen set of positive integers. Bob then considers all finite nonempty subsets B of the positive integers and only keeps those whose maximum element lies in A. So we define:\n\n\u2022 A \u2286 \u2115\u207a (Alice\u2019s chosen set of positive integers).\n\u2022 B \u2286 \u2115\u207a, B finite, B \u2260 \u2205 (any nonempty finite subset).\n\nThe condition is simply: max(B) \u2208 A. This exactly captures \u201cthe maximum element of B belongs to A.\u201d; answer - A is any subset of the positive integers: A \u2286 \u2115\u207a.  B ranges over all finite nonempty subsets of \u2115\u207a.  The condition is: max(B) \u2208 A.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need the total number of finite nonempty subsets B of positive integers such that max(B)\u2208A. Fix any a\u2208A. To form B with max(B)=a, we must include a, and we may choose any subset of {1,2,\u2026,a\u22121} (including the empty set) for the other elements of B. There are 2^{a\u22121} subsets of {1,\u2026,a\u22121}. Hence for each a in A there are 2^{a\u22121} choices for B with max(B)=a. Summing over all a\u2208A gives the total number of sets B as \u03a3_{a\u2208A}2^{a\u22121}.; answer - \u03a3_{a\u2208A}2^{a\u22121}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - For a fixed m, any finite nonempty set B with max(B)=m must include m, and every other element can only come from {1,2,\u2026,m\u22121}. Each subset of {1,\u2026,m\u22121} (including the empty set) yields one such B. There are 2^{m\u22121} subsets of {1,\u2026,m\u22121}, so there are 2^{m\u22121} sets B with maximum m.; answer - 2^{m\u22121}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3, for each fixed m in A there are 2^{m-1} finite nonempty sets B with max(B)=m. Bob\u2019s list includes all B whose maximum lies in A, so we sum over all m in A. Hence the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^{m-1} as m runs through A, and this sum equals 2024.; answer - \u2211_{m\u2208A}2^{m\u22121}=2024\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We know Bob\u2019s list has 2024 finite nonempty sets B whose maximum lies in A. For each m in A, the number of nonempty subsets of {1,2,\u2026,m} whose maximum is exactly m equals 2^{m-1}. Thus\n\n    \u2211_{m\u2208A}2^{m\u22121} = 2024.\n\nWrite 2024 in binary: 2024 = 11111101000\u2082 = 2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3.
