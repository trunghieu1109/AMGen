Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_26
proposed answer: We know Bob’s list has 2024 finite nonempty sets B whose maximum lies in A. For each m in A, the number of nonempty subsets of {1,2,…,m} whose maximum is exactly m equals 2^{m-1}. Thus

    ∑_{m∈A}2^{m−1} = 2024.

Write 2024 in binary: 2024 = 11111101000₂ = 2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. By uniqueness of binary expansion, the exponents m−1 in A are exactly 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. Hence the elements of A are m = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. Summing these gives 11+10+9+8+7+6+4 = 55.
