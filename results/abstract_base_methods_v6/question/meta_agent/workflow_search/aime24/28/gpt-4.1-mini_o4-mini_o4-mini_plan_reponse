Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 about an axis in its plane located 6 units from the circle\u2019s center. In the standard torus description, the minor radius (tube radius) is the radius of the generating circle, which here is 3. The major radius is the distance from the center of that generating circle to the axis of revolution, which is given as 6.; answer - Major radius = 6, Minor radius = 3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To analyze tangency between the torus and the sphere, it is natural to place both in a common coordinate system:\n1.  We take the torus T to be generated by revolving the circle of radius 3 in the x\u2013z plane about the z\u00ad-axis, with the circle\u2019s center at (6,0,0).  Equivalently, the torus is described by all points (x,y,z) satisfying (\u221a(x\u00b2+y\u00b2)\u20136)\u00b2+z\u00b2=3\u00b2, and its \u201ccenter\u201d (the center of its generating circle) lies on the x\u00ad-axis at (6,0,0), while the torus\u2019s rotational symmetry axis is the z\u00ad-axis.  \n2.  The sphere S has fixed radius 11.  By symmetry, when T rests on S and is tangent along a horizontal circle, the sphere\u2019s center must lie on the common symmetry axis\u2014the z\u00ad-axis of our coordinate system\u2014so that the circle of tangency is horizontal and centered on that axis.  \n3.  Thus we place the sphere\u2019s center at some point (0,0,h) on the z\u00ad-axis (the exact value of h will be determined by enforcing external tangency).  \n\nIn summary, in the coordinate system where the torus is centered at the origin with its axis the z\u00ad-axis, Sphere S is defined by\n\n{ all (x,y,z) with (x)\u00b2+(y)\u00b2+(z\u2013h)\u00b2=11\u00b2 }\n\nso its radius is 11, and its center is at (0,0,h) on the torus\u2019s axis.; answer - Sphere S has radius 11, and in the coordinate system where the torus\u2019s center is at (0,0,0) and its rotational axis is the z\u00ad-axis, the center of S lies on that axis at (0,0,h).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To correctly formulate external tangency we must: (1) enforce point\u2010coincidence between a torus surface point M and the sphere, (2) require that the outward normal to the torus at M points directly toward the sphere center (so the two normals are colinear with a positive scalar), and (3) impose that this scalar is positive to ensure external rather than internal contact.  We also track the two solutions for the meridional angle \u03b8 that yield the two distinct contact circles (one on the inner side of the tube, one on the outer side).; answer - Let R=6, \u03c1=3.  Parametrize a meridian point on T by \u03b8:  M(\u03b8)=(r,0,z) with r=R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8, z=\u03c1\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8.  Place S\u2019s center at S=(0,0,h) on the z\u2010axis.  External tangency occurs exactly when:\n1. Point\u2010coincidence: ||M(\u03b8)\u2013S||^2 = 11^2, i.e.\n   (R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8)^2 + (\u03c1\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8 \u2013 h)^2 = 121.\n2. Normal\u2010alignment with positive scale: the torus outward normal at M is n=(r\u2013R, z)=(\u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8, \u03c1\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8).  The vector toward the sphere center is v=S\u2013M=(\u2013(R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8), h \u2013 \u03c1\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8).  We require v=\u03bb\u2009n with \u03bb>0.  Equivalently,\n   \u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8 = \u2013\u03bb (R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8),\n   \u03c1\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8 =  \u03bb (h \u2013 \u03c1\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8),\n   for some \u03bb>0.\nSolving (1) and (2) simultaneously determines h and admits two real solutions \u03b8_i, \u03b8_o (one in each of the two meridional arcs where \u03bb>0).  The corresponding contact\u2010circle radii are\n   r_i = R + \u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8_i,\n   r_o = R + \u03c1\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8_o.\nThese are the two distinct external tangent configurations of T on S.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We start from the two tangency\u2010conditions already formulated: (1) the distance from M(\u03b8)=(R+\u03c1\u22c5cos\u03b8,\u20090,\u2009\u03c1\u22c5sin\u03b8) to the sphere\u2010center (0,0,h) equals the sphere radius s=11, and (2) the outward normal of the torus at M is colinear (with positive factor) with the vector from M to the sphere\u2010center. From normal\u2010alignment one deduces h=\u2212R\u2009tan\u03b8 and hence plugging into the distance equation gives\n\n  (R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u03b8)^2 + (\u03c1\u2009sin\u03b8 + R\u2009tan\u03b8)^2 = s^2\n  \u21d4 (R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u03b8)^2\u2009sec^2\u03b8 = s^2\n  \u21d4 (R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u03b8)/cos\u03b8 = \u00b1s.\n\nThis splits into two cases:\n\nCase \u201c+\u201d: R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u03b8 = s\u2009cos\u03b8  \u21d2  cos\u03b8 = R/(s\u2212\u03c1)  \u21d2  contact\u2010circle radius r = R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u03b8 = R + \u03c1\u22c5[R/(s\u2212\u03c1)] = R\u2009s/(s\u2212\u03c1).\n\nCase \u201c\u2212\u201d: R+\u03c1\u2009cos\u03b8 = \u2212s\u2009cos\u03b8 \u21d2  cos\u03b8 = \u2212R/(s+\u03c1) \u21d2  r = R+\u03c1\u22c5[\u2212R/(s+\u03c1)] = R\u2009s/(s+\u03c1).\n\nThus the two tangent\u2010circle radii are\n\n  r_o = R\u2009s/(s\u2212\u03c1),    r_i = R\u2009s/(s+\u03c1).\n\nIn particular for R=6,\u2009\u03c1=3,\u2009s=11 these become\n\n  r_o = 6\u22c511/(11\u22123) = 66/8 = 33/4,\n  r_i = 6\u22c511/(11+3) = 66/14 = 33/7.; answer - r_i = \\frac{R\\,s}{s+\\rho},\\quad r_o = \\frac{R\\,s}{s-\\rho}\\\\[6pt]\\text{In particular, for }R=6,\\rho=3,s=11:\\quad r_i=\\frac{33}{7},\\;r_o=\\frac{33}{4}.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We have r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/7, so r_i - r_o = 33*(7 - 4)/(28) = 99/28.
