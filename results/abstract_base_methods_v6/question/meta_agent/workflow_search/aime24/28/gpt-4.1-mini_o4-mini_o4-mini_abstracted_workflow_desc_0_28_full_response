Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

In this plane the torus surface is the parametric curve\n   r(θ)=R+ρ\u2009cos\u2009θ=6+3\u2009cos\u2009θ,\n   z(θ)=ρ\u2009sin\u2009θ=3\u2009sin\u2009θ,\nwhere θ∈[0,2π) and R=6, ρ=3.  The sphere of radius 11 has center on the z–axis at (r,z)=(0,−h) for some h>0, and its equation is\n   r²+(z+h)²=11².\n\nExternal tangency along a horizontal circle of the torus (φ–free so r,z fixed) requires two conditions:\n1. The point (r(θ),\u2009z(θ)) lies on the sphere:\n      (6+3\u2009cos\u2009θ)² + [3\u2009sin\u2009θ + h]² = 11².\n2. The common normal directions agree.  The torus normal at (r,z) points in the (r−6,z)–direction, and the direction from that surface point to the sphere center is (−r,−(z+h)).  These are proportional exactly when\n      (r(θ)−6):z(θ) = r(θ):(z(θ)+h).\n\nSolving these two equations in θ gives—depending on the choice of the sign of cos\u2009θ—a larger–radius contact circle (θ=θₒ) of radius rₒ=6+3\u2009cos\u2009θₒ and a smaller–radius contact circle (θ=θᵢ) of radius rᵢ=6+3\u2009cos\u2009θᵢ.  These are the two distinct external tangent configurations (tube “outside” contact vs. tube “inside” contact) that define rₒ and rᵢ.; answer: The external‐tangency conditions are:\n1. Sphere‐point coincidence: (6+3\u2009cos\u2009θ)² + [3\u2009sin\u2009θ + h]² = 11².\n2. Normal‐alignment: (r−6):z = r:(z+h), with r=6+3\u2009cos\u2009θ, z=3\u2009sin\u2009θ.\nThe two real solutions θ=θ_{o},θ_{i} in [0,2π) yield the two tangent circles of radii r_{o}=6+3\u2009cos\u2009θ_{o} and r_{i}=6+3\u2009cos\u2009θ_{i}.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent RM0M, feedback: While the two algebraic conditions (sphere‐point coincidence and normal alignment) correctly single out configurations where the torus and sphere touch in a common tangent circle, they also conceal several practical and conceptual gaps:\n1. Implicit choice of sign in the proportionality of normals: requiring (r–6):z = r:(z+h) only fixes a ratio but ignores whether the normals point toward or away from the sphere center. One must impose the correct sign to ensure external rather than internal tangency.\n2. Dependence on h: We’ve introduced the vertical offset h of the sphere center without giving its explicit value or linking it to the torus geometry. In practice, one must solve for h simultaneously to guarantee the torus “rests” on the sphere.\n3. Multiple critical points: The two equations can admit extraneous (e.g. inverted or self‐intersecting) solutions that do not correspond to a single smooth tangent circle on the torus tube. One must check that θ_i and θ_o actually lie in the domain where the torus surface is outward‐facing.\n4. Neglect of contact stability: The formulation ignores whether the identified contact circle is a stable equilibrium under gravity or only a mathematical tangency.\n5. Global embedding constraints: There is no check that the torus does not self‐intersect or pass through the sphere elsewhere.\n\nBecause of these oversights, one must supplement the pure algebraic system with geometric sign checks, a determination of h, and validation that the solutions truly correspond to the intended external contacts.; correct: The given conditions are necessary but not sufficient: they omit the sign of the normal‐vector proportionality (to distinguish external from internal tangency), fail to determine the sphere’s vertical offset h, allow extraneous algebraic solutions that violate the torus’s outward orientation, and ignore stability and global embedding constraints. Additional sign checks, a solution for h, and geometric validation are required.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent VxBS, refining tangency conditions, thinking: To correctly formulate external tangency we must: (1) enforce point‐coincidence between a torus surface point M and the sphere, (2) require that the outward normal to the torus at M points directly toward the sphere center (so the two normals are colinear with a positive scalar), and (3) impose that this scalar is positive to ensure external rather than internal contact.
