Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6 we derived that every valid assignment is uniquely determined by nonnegative integers a,b with a+b≤8, giving c=8−a−b, d=9−a, e=9−b, f=1+a+b. The number of nonnegative integer pairs (a,b) satisfying a+b≤8 is the number of solutions to a+b+c=8 in three variables, which is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45. Hence there are 45 valid assignments.
