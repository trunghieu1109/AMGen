Reading each row left to right forms a three‐digit number: the top row is 100a + 10b + c, and the bottom row is 100d + 10e + f. The problem statement requires that the sum of these two three‐digit numbers equals 999, so we add them and set that sum equal to 999.; answer - (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To express the three vertical (column) numbers, note that each column has a top digit (from the top row variables) and a bottom digit (from the bottom row). A two‐digit number with tens digit x and units digit y can be written as 10x+y. Thus the columns (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) correspond to 10a+d, 10b+e, and 10c+f.

The horizontal sum (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999 expands to 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999. Since 999 has hundreds, tens, and units digits all 9, there are no carries between these places, so a+d=9, b+e=9, and c+f=9. Next, the vertical sum (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 expands to 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. But (d+e+f)=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)−(a+b+c)=27−(a+b+c). Substituting gives 10(a+b+c)+(27−(a+b+c))=99 ⇒9(a+b+c)=72 ⇒a+b+c=8. All variables are digits, so 0≤a,b,c,d,e,f≤9.

Expanding the horizontal sum gives 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999. Since 100(a+d) is a multiple of 100 ≤1800 and the total is 999, we must have a+d=9 and then 10(b+e)+(c+f)=99. The latter forces b+e=9 and c+f=9. Next, the vertical sum is 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. But (d+e+f)=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)−(a+b+c)=27−(a+b+c). Substituting gives 10(a+b+c)+(27−(a+b+c))=99 ⇒9(a+b+c)=72 ⇒ a+b+c=8 and hence d+e+f=27−8=19. These are consistent with a+d=b+e=c+f=9. No further restrictions on individual digits arise beyond 0≤a,b,c,d,e,f≤9.; answer: The digits satisfy 0≤a,b,c,d,e,f≤9. From the horizontal sum: a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. From the vertical sum: a+b+c=8 (and then d+e+f=19).

Equation (1) becomes 100S1+10S2+S3=999, so reading as a 3‐digit sum with no extra carries gives S1=S2=S3=9.  Plugging into (2): 9T+(S1+S2+S3)=99 ⇒9T+27=99 ⇒T=8, so a+b+c=8.  Since each of a,d etc. must be digits 0–9, and S1=S2=S3=9≤9 ensures no carries in any column, we get the digit‐level constraints: 0≤a,b,c,d,e,f≤9; a+d=9; b+e=9; c+f=9; a+b+c=8.; answer: The digit‐level constraints are:\n• a,b,c,d,e,f are integers with 0≤a,b,c,d,e,f≤9\n• a+d = 9\n• b+e = 9\n• c+f = 9\n• a+b+c = 8\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, finalizing digit-level constraints, thinking: We derive constraints from the two sums.

Since 999 has hundreds, tens, and units digits all 9, there are no carries between these places, so a+d=9, b+e=9, and c+f=9. Next, the vertical sum (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 expands to 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. But (d+e+f)=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)−(a+b+c)=27−(a+b+c).
