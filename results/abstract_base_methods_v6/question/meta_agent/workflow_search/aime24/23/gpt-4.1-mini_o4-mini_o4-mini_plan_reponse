        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question asks to assign variables a,b,c to the three cells of the top row and d,e,f to the three cells of the bottom row, clearly indicating their positions in the 2\u00d73 grid. This establishes a consistent notation for subsequent equations on row and column readings.; answer - Label the 2\u00d73 grid as:\n\n| a | b | c |\n| d | e | f |\n\nwhere a, b, c are the digits in the top row from left to right, and d, e, f are the digits in the bottom row from left to right.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have labeled the top row digits a,b,c and the bottom row digits d,e,f in the 2\u00d73 grid. Reading each row left to right forms a three\u2010digit number: the top row is 100a + 10b + c, and the bottom row is 100d + 10e + f. The problem statement requires that the sum of these two three\u2010digit numbers equals 999, so we add them and set that sum equal to 999.; answer - (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To express the three vertical (column) numbers, note that each column has a top digit (from the top row variables) and a bottom digit (from the bottom row). A two\u2010digit number with tens digit x and units digit y can be written as 10x+y. Thus the columns (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) correspond to 10a+d, 10b+e, and 10c+f. Since the sum of these three column\u2010numbers must be 99, we get (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99.; answer - The three vertical numbers are 10a+d, 10b+e, and 10c+f, and the constraint is (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From sub\u2010task 2 we have the horizontal constraint:\n(100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999.\nFrom sub\u2010task 3 we have the vertical constraint:\n(10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99.\nCombining these gives the desired system of two equations in the six variables a,b,c,d,e,f.; answer - The system is\n(100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999,\n(10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We derive constraints from the two sums. The horizontal sum (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999 expands to 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999. Since 999 has hundreds, tens, and units digits all 9, there are no carries between these places, so a+d=9, b+e=9, and c+f=9. Next, the vertical sum (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 expands to 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. But (d+e+f)=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)\u2212(a+b+c)=27\u2212(a+b+c). Substituting gives 10(a+b+c)+(27\u2212(a+b+c))=99 \u21d29(a+b+c)=72 \u21d2a+b+c=8. All variables are digits, so 0\u2264a,b,c,d,e,f\u22649. Thus the system is consistent with these constraints, and there are no further restrictions.; answer - The digit\u2010level constraints are:\n\u2022 a,b,c,d,e,f are integers with 0\u2264a,b,c,d,e,f\u22649\n\u2022 a + d = 9\n\u2022 b + e = 9\n\u2022 c + f = 9\n\u2022 a + b + c = 8\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We have a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 and a+b+c=8 with 0\u2264a,b,c,d,e,f\u22649.  Hence d=9\u2212a, e=9\u2212b, f=9\u2212c.  Substituting c=8\u2212a\u2212b gives f=9\u2212(8\u2212a\u2212b)=1+a+b.  The conditions 0\u2264a,b,c\u22649 and c=8\u2212a\u2212b\u22650 are equivalent to integers a,b\u22650 with a+b\u22648.  There are number of nonneg. solutions to a+b+c=8 in three variables =C(8+3\u22121,2)=C(10,2)=45.  Thus there are 45 assignments.  Each is given by (a,b,c,d,e,f)=(a,b,8\u2212a\u2212b,9\u2212a,9\u2212b,1+a+b) for 0\u2264a,b, a+b\u22648.; answer - All 45 solutions are given by\n(a,b,c,d,e,f)=(a, b, 8\u2212a\u2212b, 9\u2212a, 9\u2212b, 1+a+b)\nfor integer pairs (a,b) with 0\u2264a,b and a+b\u22648.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From Sub-task 6 we derived that every valid assignment is uniquely determined by nonnegative integers a,b with a+b\u22648, giving c=8\u2212a\u2212b, d=9\u2212a, e=9\u2212b, f=1+a+b.
