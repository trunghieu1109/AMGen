Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We have p=17 from Sub-task 3, and we seek the least positive m with m^4 ≡ -1 mod 17^2 (289).  From Sub-task 3, 2^4≡16≡-1 mod 17, so a lift exists by Hensel’s Lemma because f(x)=x^4+1 has f′(2)=4*2^3=32≡15≠0 mod 17.  Write m=2+17t and expand f(2+17t)= (2+17t)^4+1 ≡ f(2)+f′(2)*17t (mod 17^2).  Since f(2)=2^4+1=17, f′(2)=32, we get f(2+17t)≡17+32*17t ≡17+544t (mod 289).  Reducing 544 mod 289 gives 255, so we need 17+255t≡0 mod 289.  Hensel’s formula gives t≡-f(2)/17 * (f′(2)/17)^{-1} mod 17.  Here f(2)/17=1 and f′(2)/17=32/17≡15 mod 17 with inverse 15^{-1}≡8 mod 17, so t≡-1*8≡9 mod 17.  Thus m=2+17*9=155. This is the unique lift mod 289 and is the least positive solution.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 4a we found the four solutions modulo 17^2 = 289 are m ≡ 155, 110, 179, and 134. To determine the least positive integer m satisfying m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289), we compare these four values: 110 < 134 < 155 < 179. Therefore, the smallest positive lift is m = 110.
