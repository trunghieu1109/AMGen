From Subtask 1 we know p≡1 mod 8 so there is an n₀ with n₀^4≡−1 (mod p).  To lift this solution to modulo p² we apply Hensel’s lemma.  We set f(n)=n^4+1 and compute f′(n)=4n^3.  Hensel’s lemma guarantees a unique lift of n₀ mod p to a root mod p² precisely when f′(n₀)≢0 (mod p).  Since n₀^4≡−1 (mod p) implies p∤n₀, and p≠2, we have gcd(p,4n₀^3)=1.

Thus the additional necessary and sufficient condition is that the derivative 4n₀³ not vanish mod p, so any odd prime p≡1 mod 8 admits a lift from a root mod p to a root mod p².; answer: The extra condition is that for the root n₀ of n₀⁴+1≡0 (mod p) we have f′(n₀)=4n₀³≢0 (mod p).

To lift a solution n₀ mod\u2009p to mod\u2009p² we apply Hensel’s lemma to f(n)=n^4+1.  The lemma requires f'(n₀)=4n₀^3 not ≡0 mod\u2009p, i.e. that the root mod\u2009p be simple.  Since n₀^4≡−1 mod\u2009p⇒n₀≢0 mod\u2009p and p≠2, we have p∤4n₀^3, so every solution mod\u2009p}{}lifts uniquely to mod\u2009p².
