Substituting y=mx gives a quadratic in x: (1+m²)x² + (−5−2mc)x = 0. One root is x=0 (point A), the other is x = (5+2mc)/(1+m²). Here m c =195/122 and m²=60984/450241, so 5+2mc=500/61 and 1+m²=511225/450241. Thus x_P = (500/61)/(511225/450241) = 9004820/1247389 and y_P = m x_P = 594318120√14/836998019.; answer: (9004820/1247389, 594318120√14/836998019)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, deciding point P, thinking: Both solutions from agents ecpx and iutl compute the second intersection of line AD (through A with slope m=66√14/671) with the circumcircle (x−5/2)²+(y−65√14/56)²=5625/224.  Substitution y=mx yields a quadratic in x with roots x=0 (for A) and x = (5+2mc)/(1+m²).  Evaluating m c = 195/122 and m² = 60984/450241 gives\n5+2mc = 500/61,    1+m² = 511225/450241\nhence x_P = (500/61)/(511225/450241) = 9004820/1247389.  Then y_P = m·x_P = (66√14/671)·(9004820/1247389) = 594318120√14/836998019.

Hence the second intersection P of AD with the circumcircle satisfies PB∶PC=AB∶AC=5∶10=1∶2.  Write PB=x, PC=2x.  In cyclic quadrilateral ABPC, Ptolemy’s Theorem gives AB·PC+AC·PB=AP·BC, so 5·(2x)+10·x=AP·9 ⇒20x=9·AP ⇒AP=(20/9)x.  To find x, use the Law of Cosines in ΔBPC: BC²=PB²+PC²–2·PB·PC·cos∠BPC.  Since ∠BPC=180°–∠BAC, cos∠BPC=–cos A.  But cos A=(AB²+AC²–BC²)/(2·AB·AC)=(25+100–81)/(2·5·10)=44/100=11/25.  Thus 81=BC²= x²+4x²–2·x·2x·(–11/25)=5x²+ (4·11/25)x²= x²(5+44/25)=x²·(169/25).  Hence x²=81·25/169=2025/169, so x=45/13.  Therefore AP=(20/9)(45/13)=100/13.; answer: 100/13\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent xegW, round 0, calculate length AP, thinking: To find AP, note A=(0,0) and P=(x_P,y_P).

The coordinate‐bash by agent xegW yields a monstrous radical expression, but from classical projective geometry we know that D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, so AD is the A‐symmedian. Hence when AD meets the circumcircle again at P, the chord ratios satisfy PB∶PC = AB∶AC = 5∶10 = 1∶2.  Let PB = x, PC = 2x.  In cyclic quadrilateral ABPC, Ptolemy’s theorem gives\n  AB⋅PC + AC⋅PB = AP⋅BC\n⇒ 5⋅(2x) + 10⋅x = 9⋅AP\n⇒ 20x = 9⋅AP\n⇒ AP = (20/9)x.\nTo find x, note in ΔBPC, BC² = PB² + PC² – 2⋅PB⋅PC⋅cos∠BPC.  Since ∠BPC = 180° – ∠BAC, cos∠BPC = −cos A.  By the Law of Cosines in ΔABC,\n cos A = (AB² + AC² − BC²)/(2⋅AB⋅AC) = (25 + 100 − 81)/(2⋅5⋅10) = 44/100 = 11/25.\n Thus\n  81 = x² + 4x² − 2⋅x⋅2x⋅(−11/25) = 5x² + (44/25)x² = (169/25)x²\n⇒ x² = 81⋅25/169 = 2025/169\n⇒ x = 45/13.\nTherefore\n  AP = (20/9)⋅(45/13) = 100/13.\nThis clean result matches the classical symmedian\u2009+\u2009Ptolemy approach and supersedes the unwieldy coordinate radical form.
