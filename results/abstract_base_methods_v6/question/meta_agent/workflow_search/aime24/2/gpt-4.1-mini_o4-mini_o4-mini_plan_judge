Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We start from the fraction 202/256. The greatest common divisor of 202 and 256 is 2, so dividing numerator and denominator by 2 yields 101/128. Since 101 and 128 share no common factors, they are relatively prime. Therefore m=101 and n=128, and m+n = 101 + 128 = 229.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we determined that the probability in lowest terms is m/n = 163/256, where 163 and 256 share no common divisors. Sub-task 7 asks for the sum m + n. Here, m = 163 and n = 256, so m + n = 163 + 256 = 419.
