A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries: rotations by k\u00b745\u00b0 for k=0,\u2026,7. These form a cyclic group of order 8, often denoted C8.

Rotation r^k decomposes the 8 vertices into d = gcd(k,8) disjoint cycles (orbits) each of length L = 8/d. On each cycle, the condition \u201cno blue maps to blue\u201d is equivalent to forbidding two adjacent blues around the cycle.

Equivalently, for any S\u2286{0,\u2026,7} chosen as the blue vertices, S\u2229(S+k)=\u2205.  For A_i\u2229A_j we require S\u2229(S+i)=\u2205 and S\u2229(S+j)=\u2205.  This says S is an independent set in the circulant graph on 8 vertices with edges of lengths i and j (undirected, identifying k\u21948\u2212k).  We then count independent sets in each such circulant, using known Fibonacci\u2010cycle formulas for single\u2010step circulants and by direct gap\u2010counting or inclusion\u2013exclusion on matchings for the mixed\u2010step cases.

Note first that S\u2229(S+k)=\u2205 implies |S|+|S+k|=2|S|\u22648 \u21d2 |S|\u22644.  Thus no set of size \u22655 can lie in any A_k.  Conversely, if |S|=t\u22644 then the set of \u201cbad\u201d k for which S\u2229(S+k)\u2260\u2205 is exactly the set of nonzero differences between elements of S; there are at most C(t,2) distinct undirected differences \u22646 (max at t=4), but there are 7 possible nonzero k.  Hence there is always at least one k avoiding all differences and yielding S\u2229(S+k)=\u2205.  Therefore every S of size 0\u2264t\u22644 lies in \u22c3_{k=0}^7 A_k, and no larger S does.

If t\u22655 then |S|+|S+k|=2t\u226510>8, so by the pigeonhole principle S and S+k must share at least one vertex; thus no rotation yields S\u2229(S+k)=\u2205. Therefore only blue sets of size t\u22644 can lie in the union \u22c3_{k=1}^7 A_k. The total number of such colorings is \u2211_{i=0}^4 C(8,i)=C(8,0)+C(8,1)+C(8,2)+C(8,3)+C(8,4)=1+8+28+56+70=163, matching the inclusion\u2013exclusion result.; answer - 163\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5f output: thinking - We have two independent ways to compute |\u22c3_{k=0}^7 A_k|:\n\n1.

Complement (pigeonhole) argument: Only blue\u2010vertex sets of size t\u22644 can avoid overlapping with some nonzero rotation, so |\u22c3A_k| = \u2211_{i=0}^4 C(8,i) = 1+8+28+56+70 = 163.\n\nSince both methods give the identical result 163 with matching arithmetic at each step, there is no discrepancy.
