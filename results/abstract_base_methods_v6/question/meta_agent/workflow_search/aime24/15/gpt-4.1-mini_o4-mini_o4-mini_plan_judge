Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: To find o (the number with all four items), use inclusion–exclusion with the counts of exactly two and exactly three ownerships. Let a1=195+367+562+900=2024. Let a2 be the sum of pairwise intersections: each of the 437 exactly-two owners contributes 1 to a2, each of the 234 exactly-three owners contributes C(3,2)=3, and the o quadruple owners contributes C(4,2)=6. So a2=437+3·234+6o=437+702+6o=1139+6o. Similarly a3 (sum of triple intersections)=234+4o since each exactly-3 owner is in 1 triple, each quadruple owner in C(4,3)=4 triples. Inclusion–exclusion gives total with at least one item: a1−a2+a3−o=900. Substituting: 2024−(1139+6o)+(234+4o)−o=900 ⇒2024−1139−6o+234+4o−o=900 ⇒1119−3o=900 ⇒3o=219 ⇒o=73.

proposed answer: To resolve the ambiguity, we interpret “exactly two” and “exactly three” as referring to the four–item universe (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, candy hearts). Let n1 = number owning exactly one item, n2 = 437, n3 = 234, n4 = number owning all four, and total sum of item‐counts =195+367+562+900=2024. We have: (1) n1 +2·n2 +3·n3 +4·n4 =2024, (2) n1 +n2 +n3 +n4 =900. Substituting n2=437 and n3=234 gives n1+874+702+4n4=2024 → n1+4n4=448, and n1+437+234+n4=900 → n1+n4=229. Subtracting yields 3n4=219 → n4=73, and then n1=156. Because candy hearts is universal, the triple overlap of the three partial items also matches n4. Thus the data uniquely determine that 73 residents own all four items.
