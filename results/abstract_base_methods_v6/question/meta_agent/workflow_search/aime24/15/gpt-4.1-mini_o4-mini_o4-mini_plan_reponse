From the problem statement we have: 195 residents own a diamond ring; 367 own a set of golf clubs; 562 own a garden spade; and every one of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.; answer - The four categories are:\n1. Diamond ring (195 owners)\n2. Golf clubs (367 owners)\n3. Garden spade (562 owners)\n4. Bag of candy hearts (900 owners)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To set up equations for inclusion\u2013exclusion or any combinatorial accounting, we partition the 900 residents into disjoint groups by exactly which subset of the four items they own. Each resident falls into exactly one of the 16 possible subsets of {diamond ring (R), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), candy hearts (H)}. We only need to name variables for those owning exactly one item, exactly two, exactly three, and all four.

Each resident falls into exactly one of the 16 subsets of {R,G,S,H}, but since everyone owns H, the empty set is impossible and the relevant subsets are those with H plus those without H. We write one equation for the grand total of residents, one for each item\u2019s total ownership, one for the number owning exactly two items, and one for the number owning exactly three items. These yield a system of seven linear equations in the 15 variables.; answer - System of equations relating the 15 variables a\u2013o:\n(1) Total residents: a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o = 900\n(2) Diamond rings (R):   a + e + f + g + k + l + m + o = 195\n(3) Golf clubs (G):      b + e + h + i + k + l + n + o = 367\n(4) Garden spades (S):   c + f + h + j + k + m + n + o = 562\n(5) Candy hearts (H):    d + g + i + j + l + m + n + o = 900\n(6) Exactly two items:  e + f + g + h + i + j = 437\n(7) Exactly three items: k + l + m + n = 234\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To find o (the number with all four items), use inclusion\u2013exclusion with the counts of exactly two and exactly three ownerships.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem describes four categories of items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. It gives the counts for the first three and explicitly states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts, making that the universal set. Thus the four categories and their ownership counts are: diamond ring (195), golf clubs (367), garden spade (562), bag of candy hearts (900).; answer - The four categories are:\n1.

Bag of candy hearts: 900 owners (all residents own this)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To cover all possible ownership combinations among the three partially owned items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), we need one variable for each non\u2010empty subset of {ring, clubs, spade}. That yields 3 single\u2010item subsets, 3 two\u2010item subsets, and 1 three\u2010item subset, for a total of 7 variables. We exclude candy hearts since it is owned by everyone and does not affect the distinctions among these subsets.; answer - Define the following variables for the 900 residents:\n\nExactly one item:\n r = number owning only a diamond ring\n c = number owning only golf clubs\n s = number owning only a garden spade\n\nExactly two items:\n rc = number owning a diamond ring and golf clubs but not a garden spade\n rs = number owning a diamond ring and garden spade but not golf clubs\n cs = number owning golf clubs and garden spade but not a diamond ring\n\nAll three items:\n rcs = number owning a diamond ring, golf clubs, and a garden spade\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We need equations relating the seven variables r,c,s,rc,rs,cs,rcs to the given totals: 195 ring\u2010owners, 367 club\u2010owners, 562 spade\u2010owners, 437 residents owning exactly two of the four (which equals those owning exactly one of the three: r+c+s), 234 owning exactly three of the four (those owning exactly two of the three: rc+rs+cs), and the total of 900 residents equals all subsets of the three since candy hearts is universal and excluded.  This yields a system of six equations in our seven variables.; answer - Let r,c,s,rc,rs,cs,rcs be as defined.

Every subset count (r, c, s, rc, rs, cs, rcs) already refers solely to combinations of diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. Thus the existing system of six equations in seven variables correctly applies inclusion\u2013exclusion only to the three partially owned items, with candy hearts treated as a constant factor. No equation needs adjustment.; answer - Candy hearts\u2019 universal ownership means they can be ignored in the inclusion\u2013exclusion counts. The system of seven variables and six equations involving only diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades is already correct and needs no modification.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To resolve the ambiguity, we interpret \u201cexactly two\u201d and \u201cexactly three\u201d as referring to the four\u2013item universe (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, candy hearts).
