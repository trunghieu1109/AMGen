        "problem": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "From previous sub\u2010tasks, the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115. This fraction is already in lowest terms (m=1, n=115), so m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nAnswer:116",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need the number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from 10 without regard to order. This is a combinations problem: C(10,4) = 10!/(4!\u00b76!) = (10\u00b79\u00b78\u00b77)/(4\u00b73\u00b72\u00b71) = 210.; answer - 210\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To have exactly k matches: we choose k of Jen\u2019s 4 numbers (C(4,k) ways) and choose the remaining 4\u2212k numbers from the 6 numbers she didn\u2019t pick (C(6,4\u2212k) ways). Multiply to get the total for each k. Specifically:\n\u2022 k=2: C(4,2)\u00b7C(6,2)=6\u00b715=90\n\u2022 k=3: C(4,3)\u00b7C(6,1)=4\u00b76=24\n\u2022 k=4: C(4,4)\u00b7C(6,0)=1\u00b71=1; answer - For k=2: 90; for k=3: 24; for k=4: 1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To win a prize Jen needs at least 2 matches. From Sub-task 2 we have exactly 2 matches in 90 outcomes, exactly 3 matches in 24 outcomes, and exactly 4 matches in 1 outcome. Summing these gives 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 winning outcomes.; answer - 115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we found exactly 4 matches occurs in 1 way. From Sub-task 3 the total winning (at least 2 matches) outcomes is 115. The conditional probability of all 4 matching given a win is the ratio of the 4-match outcomes to the total winning outcomes, which is 1/115.; answer - 1/115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From previous sub\u2010tasks, the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115. This fraction is already in lowest terms (m=1, n=115), so m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.; answer - 116"
