Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We must count all maximal placements corresponding to row–column colour assignments (r,c)∈{W,B}^5×{W,B}^5 for which every empty cell (where r_i≠c_j) cannot be filled without violating the uniform‐row or uniform‐column condition.  An empty cell of type (W, B) is forbidden iff there is at least one white–white chip (so rows W have chips and columns W have chips) and at least one black–black chip (so rows B have chips and columns B have chips).  In other words, both the white–white and black–black intersections must be nonempty to block all mismatches.  These two groups are nonempty exactly when 1≤#white rows≤4 and 1≤#white cols≤4, or in the two extreme cases #white rows=#white cols=0 or =5.  The number of ways to choose i white rows and j white columns is C(5,i)C(5,j).  Summing over i,j=1..4 gives (Σ_{i=1..4}C(5,i))^2=30^2=900, and adding the two extremal cases (i=j=0 and i=j=5) gives 900+2=902.
