        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The subtask asks to restate the four conditions (a)\u2013(d) precisely.  I introduced a function g on the 5\u00d75 grid taking values in {white, black, empty}.  Then I translated each verbal constraint into a logical condition on g.  For maximality (d) I observed that in any empty cell both its row and column must already host chips of opposite colors, else one could add a chip there without conflict.; answer - Let the grid cells be indexed by (i,j) with i,j\u2208{1,\u2026,5}, and define a placement function g:(i,j)\u21a6{white,black,empty}.  Then:\n(a) (At most one chip)  \u2200(i,j): g(i,j)\u2208{white,black,empty} (so no cell holds more than one chip).\n(b) (Row uniformity)  \u2200i\u2208{1,\u2026,5}, \u2200j1,j2: if g(i,j1)\u2260empty and g(i,j2)\u2260empty then g(i,j1)=g(i,j2).\n(c) (Column uniformity)  \u2200j\u2208{1,\u2026,5}, \u2200i1,i2: if g(i1,j)\u2260empty and g(i2,j)\u2260empty then g(i1,j)=g(i2,j).\n(d) (Maximality)  For every empty cell (i,j) (i.e. g(i,j)=empty), either row i already contains only white chips and column j contains only black chips, or row i contains only black chips and column j only white chips.  Equivalently, if we let c_row(i) be the common color of chips in row i (if any), and c_col(j) the common color in column j (if any), then for each g(i,j)=empty we have c_row(i) and c_col(j) both defined and c_row(i)\u2260c_col(j), so that adding any white or black chip at (i,j) would violate (b) or (c).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From the maximality condition (d) we saw that every empty cell (i,j) must have both its row and its column already carrying chips of opposite colours, so no new chip (white or black) could be placed there.  But if a row had no chips at all then its cells would be \u2018\u2018unblocked\u2019\u2019 (you could add a chip matching some column\u2019s colour), contradicting maximality.  Likewise every column must carry at least one chip.  Hence each of the 5 rows has a well-defined colour r(i)\u2208{W,B} and each of the 5 columns has a well-defined colour c(j)\u2208{W,B}.  Now for any cell (i,j):\n\u2013 If r(i)=c(j), then placing a chip of that colour there does not violate row or column uniformity, so maximality forces that the cell is filled by a chip of that common colour.\n\u2013 If r(i)\u2260c(j), then placing either white or black would break uniformity in row or column, so the cell must be empty.\nThus every placement is entirely determined by the two labellings r: rows\u2192{W,B} and c: columns\u2192{W,B}, with filled cells exactly those where r(i)=c(j), each chip coloured accordingly.; answer - Each valid maximal placement arises by choosing a colour assignment r for the 5 rows and c for the 5 columns (each row and column must carry at least one chip).  Then in cell (i,j) you place a chip exactly when r(i)=c(j), and its colour is that common value; whenever r(i)\u2260c(j) the cell remains empty.  This pattern satisfies (a)\u2013(d) and describes precisely all possibilities.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-tasks 1 and 2, each of the 5 rows has a fixed color r(i)\u2208{W,B} and each of the 5 columns has a fixed color c(j)\u2208{W,B}, and the placement fills cell (i,j) exactly when r(i)=c(j).  To be maximal, every row must contain at least one chip\u2014so its color must match at least one column\u2014and every column must contain at least one chip\u2014so its color must match at least one row.  Hence neither the row\u2013labelling nor the column\u2013labelling can be monochromatic: each must include at least one white and at least one black.  There are 2^5 total ways to color 5 rows, minus the 2 monochromatic choices = 30 valid row\u2010labellings; similarly 30 valid column\u2010labellings.  Combining these independently gives 30\u00d730=900 possible assignments.; answer - All assignments of colours to the 5 rows and 5 columns in which each labelling uses both white and black at least once. There are (2^5 \u2212 2)^2 = 900 such assignments.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Given any valid coloring assignment (with each of the 5 rows and 5 columns using both colors somewhere), the placement rule is forced: place a chip in cell (i,j) if and only if the color of row i equals the color of column j.  This both satisfies the \u201csame\u2010colour in row/column\u201d rule and achieves maximality (every row and column has at least one match).  Any other choice either breaks the colour\u2010consistency or fails to be maximal.  Hence for each assignment there is exactly one way to place the chips.; answer - 1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We must count all maximal placements corresponding to row\u2013column colour assignments (r,c)\u2208{W,B}^5\u00d7{W,B}^5 for which every empty cell (where r_i\u2260c_j) cannot be filled without violating the uniform\u2010row or uniform\u2010column condition.
