There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We are asked to verify that the given edge\u2010length equalities are consistent and to understand the resulting symmetry of the tetrahedron.  We list the six edges and check which are declared equal:  \n\n \u2022 AB=\u221a41 and CD=\u221a41  \n \u2022 AC=\u221a80 and BD=\u221a80  \n \u2022 BC=\u221a89 and AD=\u221a89  \n\nThus each pair of opposite edges is equal.  A nondegenerate tetrahedron with its three pairs of opposite edges equal is called an isosceles (or disphenoid) tetrahedron.  Such a tetrahedron has D\u2082 symmetry (three mutually perpendicular 2\u2010fold axes through the midpoints of opposite edges) and is exactly the condition needed for a point inside to have equal distances to all four faces.  One can also check via the Cayley\u2013Menger determinant that the edge\u2010length data produce a positive volume, confirming no degeneracy.; answer - The tetrahedron is a disphenoid (isosceles) one, since each pair of opposite edges satisfies AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To respect the disphenoid symmetry (each pair of opposite edges equal) we place the tetrahedron so that opposite vertices differ by sign in two coordinates.  Concretely let\n A=(a,b,c),\n B=(a,\u2013b,\u2013c),\n C=(\u2013a,b,\u2013c),\n D=(\u2013a,\u2013b,c).\n Then one checks\n  AB=2\u221a(b\u00b2+c\u00b2)=\u221a41 \u21d2 b\u00b2+c\u00b2=41/4,\n  AC=2\u221a(a\u00b2+c\u00b2)=\u221a80 \u21d2 a\u00b2+c\u00b2=80/4=20,\n  BC=2\u221a(a\u00b2+b\u00b2)=\u221a89 \u21d2 a\u00b2+b\u00b2=89/4.\n Subtracting the first two gives b\u00b2\u2013a\u00b2=(41\u201380)/4=\u201339/4, but more directly subtracting 3rd\u20131st gives a\u00b2\u2013c\u00b2=(89\u201341)/4=48/4=12, etc.  Solving yields c\u00b2=4 \u21d2 c=2, b\u00b2=25/4 \u21d2 b=5/2, and a\u00b2=16 \u21d2 a=4.  Thus the choice (a,b,c)=(4,5/2,2) satisfies all lengths and exhibits the required symmetries.; answer - One suitable assignment is\n A=(4, 5/2, 2),\n B=(4, \u20135/2, \u20132),\n C=(\u20134, 5/2, \u20132),\n D=(\u20134, \u20135/2, 2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We use the coordinates A=(4,5/2,2), B=(4,\u22125/2,\u22122), C=(\u22124,5/2,\u22122), D=(\u22124,\u22125/2,2). For each triangular face we compute two edge vectors from one vertex, take their cross product, find its magnitude, and halve it. For example for \u0394ABC: AB=(0,\u22125,\u22124), AC=(\u22128,0,\u22124), so AB\u00d7AC=(20,32,\u221240) whose norm is 12\u221a21, giving area \u00bd\u00b712\u221a21=6\u221a21. Repeating for \u0394ABD, \u0394ACD, and \u0394BCD yields the same norm 12\u221a21 and thus the same area 6\u221a21 for each face.; answer - area(ABC)=6\u221a21, area(ABD)=6\u221a21, area(ACD)=6\u221a21, area(BCD)=6\u221a21\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We compute the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD with vertices A=(4,5/2,2), B=(4,\u20135/2,\u20132), C=(\u20134,5/2,\u20132), and D=(\u20134,\u20135/2,2) by the formula V=1/6 |det(B\u2013A, C\u2013A, D\u2013A)|. \n\nFirst, form the edge vectors from A:\nB\u2013A = (0, \u20135, \u20134),\nC\u2013A = (\u20138, 0, \u20134),\nD\u2013A = (\u20138, \u20135, 0).\n\nCompute the determinant of the matrix whose rows are these vectors:\n|0   \u20135  \u20134|\n|\u20138   0  \u20134|\n|\u20138  \u20135   0|\n\nUsing cofactor expansion:\nD = 0*det|\n            0 \u20134\n           \u20135  0|  \n    \u2013(\u20135)*det|\n           \u20138 \u20134\n           \u20138  0|  \n    + (\u20134)*det|\n           \u20138  0\n           \u20138 \u20135|\n  = 0 + 5*(\u201332) + (\u20134)*(40)\n  = \u2013160 \u2013160 = \u2013320.\n\nThus |D|=320, so V = (1/6)*320 = 160/3.; answer - 160/3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We know from Sub-task 3 that each of the four faces has area 6\u221a21, so the total surface area S=4\u00b76\u221a21=24\u221a21. From Sub-task 4 the volume of the tetrahedron is V=160/3. The incenter (inradius) distance d of a tetrahedron is given by d=3V/S. Substituting gives d=(3\u00b7(160/3))/(24\u221a21)=160/(24\u221a21)=(20/3)(1/\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21). Rationalizing the denominator yields d=20\u221a21/(3\u00b721)=20\u221a21/63.; answer - 20\u221a21/63\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Starting from d = 20/(3\u221a21), multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21 to rationalize: d = (20\u221a21)/(3\u00b721) = 20\u221a21/63.  Check gcd(20,\u200963)=1 and 21 is square\u2010free, so the expression is in lowest terms with m=20, n=21, p=63.; answer - m=20, n=21, p=63\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From the simplified form m=20, n=21, p=63, their sum is 20+21+63=104.; answer - 104"
