Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We pair up the 12 “chord‐families” indexed by s≡i+j (mod 12) into 6 perpendicular pairs (s,s+6).  Each family s contains f(s) chords where f(s)=5 if s is even and 6 if s is odd.  In each perpendicular pair both families have the same size, so the number of rectangles from that pair is C(f,2)^2.  There are three pairs with f=5 (C(5,2)=10 ⇒10^2=100) and three with f=6 (C(6,2)=15 ⇒15^2=225), giving 3·100+3·225=300+675=975 distinct rectangles.

proposed answer: I reviewed the proposed sanity checks: comparing with known n=4 and n=8 cases; identifying the four perpendicular chord‐length classes for n=12; counting 24 rectangles per class under rotation; and checking against a loose chord‐pair upper bound. These checks are coherent and reproduce known small‐n results, and they correctly identify and count the only perpendicular chord‐length pairings for n=12. However, they rely heavily on symmetry and chord‐length classification without an independent endpoint‐level enumeration or computational verification. They also assume no rectangles arise from more than two chord‐length classes and do not explicitly rule out degenerate or overlapping cases. Thus, while the count of 96 is internally consistent and plausible, a truly airtight proof would require an exhaustive check of all chord‐endpoint combinations or a computer‐assisted enumeration to eliminate any subtle omissions or overcounts.

Answer:After this final sanity check, we confirm that there are 96 distinct rectangles in the regular dodecagon, though the argument’s reliance on symmetry and chord‐length classes—without exhaustive enumeration—constitutes a limitation that could be addressed by a full endpoint‐level or computational verification.
