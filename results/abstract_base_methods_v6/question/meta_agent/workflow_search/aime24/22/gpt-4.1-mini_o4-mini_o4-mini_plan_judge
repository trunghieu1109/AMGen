Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: From the verified list [5, 7, 9, 9]:
- Square each term: 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49, 9^2 = 81 (and there are two 9’s so two 81’s).
- Sum of squares = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
