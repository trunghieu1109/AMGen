        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need an even number of elements (otherwise the median is an actual list element, which would then be in the list, contradicting the problem).  Let n be the list length and f the frequency of 9.  To have a unique mode 9, f\u22652 and every other number appears less than f times.  The total sum is 30, so the remaining (n\u2013f) positive integers sum to 30\u20139f.  They must all be distinct (to avoid tying the mode) and \u22651.  The minimum sum of m distinct positives is m(m+1)/2.  Thus\n  30\u20139f \u2265 (n\u2013f)(n\u2013f+1)/2.\nAlso n must be even and \u22654.  Trying f=3 gives too small a leftover sum or ties the mode; f=2 gives 30\u201318=12 to be split among m=n\u20132 distinct positive integers.  We require m(m+1)/2 \u226412 \u21d2 m\u22644 \u21d2 n\u22646.  Possible even n in [4,6] are n=4 or 6.  However, checking the median condition: for n=6 the two middle numbers must average to a positive integer M not in the list; the only ways to split 12 into 4 distinct positives are {1,2,3,6} or {1,2,4,5}, both yielding a non-integer median.  For n=4, splitting 12 into 2 distinct positives that work is {5,7}, giving sorted list [5,7,9,9] and median (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer not in the list.  Therefore the only possible length is 4.; answer - The only possible length of the list is 4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we know the list has length 4 and sum 30. To have a unique mode of 9, 9 must appear at least twice (otherwise it couldn\u2019t beat any other value), and no other value may appear twice or more (to avoid tying). Let f be the frequency of 9.  If f\u22653, then the remaining (4\u2013f) slots are too few to absorb the leftover sum 30\u20139f without creating invalid medians or nonpositive entries.  Concretely: \n\u2013 f=3 \u21d2 leftover sum 30\u201327=3 for 1 entry; that entry is 3, giving list [3,9,9,9] whose median is (9+9)/2=9 (not allowed).\n\u2013 f=4 \u21d2 leftover sum 30\u201336=\u20136 impossible.\nHence f=2.  Then the two non\u20109 entries must be distinct positives (each frequency 1) summing to 30\u201318=12.  They cannot be 9, nor equal to each other (to keep 9 uniquely most frequent).  This perfectly matches the list [5,7,9,9] giving median (7+9)/2=8, an integer absent from the list.; answer - The unique mode being 9 forces it to appear exactly twice (the minimum to beat all others), with every other element appearing once or not at all. In our length-4 solution, then, we have two 9\u2019s and two distinct positive integers summing to 12, each occurring once and not equal to 9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - For an even-length list the median is the average of the two middle entries. It must be an integer not in the list itself. From Sub-task 1 we have n=4, with two 9's and two distinct positive integers summing to 12. Call them a<b. The sorted list is [a,b,9,9] and the median is (b+9)/2. To be integer, b+9 must be even \u21d2 b is odd. The only partitions of 12 into two distinct positives are (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7). Of these, b\u22649 forces (3,9),(4,8),(5,7). (3,9) duplicates 9; (4,8) gives median 8.5; only (5,7) gives median (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer not in the list. Thus the sole possible median is 8, fixing the two middle entries as 7 and 9 and the list as [5,7,9,9].; answer - The only possible median is 8, which forces the list to be [5,7,9,9] with length 4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we know 9 must appear exactly twice (to be the unique mode) and all other entries appear once. Let the other two positive integers be a and b with a<b and a+b=30\u22129\u22129=12.  From Sub-task 3, the median of the even\u2010length list [a,b,9,9] is (b+9)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.  Thus b must be odd and (b+9)/2\u2209{a,b,9}.  The only distinct positive partition of 12 with b odd is (5,7).  That gives the sorted list [5,7,9,9] with median (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list.  All other partitions either duplicate 9, fail to yield an integer median, or place the median inside the list.  Hence the only candidate list is [5,7,9,9].; answer - The only candidate list is [5, 7, 9, 9].\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We verify the single candidate list [5,7,9,9]:\n1. Sum: 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, as required.\n2. Mode: 9 appears twice, all others appear once, so 9 is the unique mode.\n3. Median: Sorted list is [5,7,9,9], median is (7+9)/2 = 8, which is a positive integer and does not appear in the list.\nAll conditions hold and no other candidate arises, so this is the only valid list.; answer - The only valid list is [5, 7, 9, 9].\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From the verified list [5, 7, 9, 9]:\n- Square each term: 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49, 9^2 = 81 (and there are two 9\u2019s so two 81\u2019s).\n- Sum of squares = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.; answer - 236"
