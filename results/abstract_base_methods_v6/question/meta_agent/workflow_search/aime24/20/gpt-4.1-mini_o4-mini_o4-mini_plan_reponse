Writing n=xb+y with 1\u2264x< b and 0\u2264y< b, the condition x+y=\u221an implies n=(x+y)\u00b2 and simultaneously n=xb+y, so b=( (x+y)\u00b2\u2212y )/x.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to restate the definition of a b-eautiful number. A positive integer n is b-eautiful exactly when its base-b representation has two digits x (most significant) and y (least significant), with 1\u2264x<b and 0\u2264y<b, so that n = x\u00b7b + y, and the digit sum x + y equals sqrt(n).; answer - A positive integer n is b-eautiful if n = x\u00b7b + y for digits x,y with 1\u2264x<b, 0\u2264y<b, and x + y = \u221an.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We know that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if its base-b expansion has two digits x (the tens place) and y (the units place), so n = x\u00b7b + y, and the digit sum equals \u221an, i.e. x + y = \u221an. Substituting n from the first equation into the second, we square both sides of x + y = \u221an to obtain (x + y)\u00b2 = n. Replacing n by x\u00b7b + y in this squared equation yields the required algebraic relation: (x + y)\u00b2 = b\u00b7x + y.; answer - (x + y)\u00b2 = b\u00b7x + y\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We start from the definition n is b\u2010eautiful iff n in base b is two digits x,y with n=xb+y and x+y=\u221an.  Squaring the second equation gives (x+y)^2=n, so (x+y)^2=xb+y.  Set s=x+y to rewrite it as s^2=xb+y.  Since y=s\u2212x we get s^2=xb+(s\u2212x)=x(b\u22121)+s, hence x(b\u22121)=s(s\u22121).  Because 1\u2264x<b and 0\u2264y=s\u2212x<b we must have b\u22121 divides s(s\u22121), x=s(s\u22121)/(b\u22121) in [1,b\u22121], y=s\u2212x in [0,b\u22121], s<b, and s\u22652 so that x>0.  Thus the only b\u2010eautiful integers are n=s^2 for those s satisfying these divisibility and range conditions.; answer - The b\u2010eautiful condition is equivalent to (x+y)^2 = b x + y with digits satisfying 1\u2264x<b, 0\u2264y<b.  Writing s=x+y gives n=s^2 and the key relation x(b\u22121)=s(s\u22121), so b\u22121 divides s(s\u22121), x=s(s\u22121)/(b\u22121)\u2208[1,b\u22121], y=s\u2212x\u2208[0,b\u22121], s<b and s\u22652.  Hence the only possible b\u2010eautiful numbers are n=s^2 for those integer s satisfying these divisibility and bound conditions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We want to list all two\u2010digit base-b numbers n=xb+y whose digit sum x+y equals \u221an (an integer).  Equivalently (x+y)^2=xb+y.  Set s=x+y; then s^2=xb+y so y=s\u2212x and s^2=x b + (s\u2212x)=x(b\u22121)+s, hence x(b\u22121)=s(s\u22121).  Thus for each integer s\u22652 we check whether b\u22121 divides s(s\u22121).  Whenever it does, we set x=s(s\u22121)/(b\u22121) and y=s\u2212x; we must also have 1\u2264x<b, 0\u2264y<b and s<x+y<b so s<b.  These (x,y) are exactly the b-eautiful digit pairs.  Equivalently, one may simply loop x from 1 to b\u20131 and y from 0 to b\u20131, compute n=xb+y, check if \u221an is integral and equals x+y, and record those (x,y).; answer - For a fixed base b, the b-eautiful digit pairs (x,y) are exactly those obtained by:  For each integer s with 2\u2264s<b such that (b\u22121) divides s(s\u22121), set x = s(s\u22121)/(b\u22121) and y = s\u2212x.  Equivalently, one may enumerate all 1\u2264x<b, 0\u2264y<b and select those satisfying x+y = \u221a(x\u00b7b + y).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The proposed enumeration method directly implements the definition of b-beautiful numbers by checking every possible two-digit base-b representation (x\u00b7b+y with 1\u2264x<b, 0\u2264y<b) and verifying x+y=\u221an. Since it visits each candidate exactly once and performs an exact equality test, it neither misses nor double-counts any solutions. The runtime is \u0398(b\u00b2), which is feasible for moderate b, and the logic is airtight. Therefore this method correctly counts the number of b-beautiful numbers.; answer - The enumeration algorithm is correct: by iterating x=1\u2026b\u22121 and y=0\u2026b\u22121, computing n=x\u00b7b+y and s=x+y, and incrementing the count exactly when s\u00b2=n, we examine every two-digit base-b number once and correctly identify all b-beautiful integers.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We derived earlier that the number of b-beautiful integers for base b is 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}\u22121, where \u03c9(n) is the number of distinct prime factors of n. To have more than ten such numbers we need 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}\u22121>10 \u21d2 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}>11 \u21d2 \u03c9(b\u22121)\u22654. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210=2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77, so b\u22121=210 \u21d2 b=211.
