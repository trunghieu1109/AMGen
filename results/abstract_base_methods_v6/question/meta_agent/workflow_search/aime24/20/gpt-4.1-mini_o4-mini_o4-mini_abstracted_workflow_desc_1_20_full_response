By definition n written in base b with two digits x (most-significant) and y (least-significant) gives n=xb+y, and the digit sum equals √n, so x+y=√n.  Squaring the latter yields (x+y)^2=n and substituting n=xb+y gives the key equation (x+y)^2=xb+y.  To analyze solutions we set s=x+y, so n=s^2, and rewrite (x+y)^2=xb+y as s^2=xb+y.  But y=s−x, so s^2=xb+(s−x)=x(b−1)+s, hence x(b−1)=s(s−1).  Since x< b and x≥1, b−1 must divide s(s−1) and x=s(s−1)/(b−1) must be an integer in [1,b−1].  Also y=s−x must lie in [0,b−1].  Finally n=s^2<b^2 so s<b.  Thus the only candidates are perfect squares s^2 with 1≤s≤b−1 for which b−1 divides s(s−1), yielding x and y=s−x in range.  Those s determine all b-eautiful n.; answer: The b-eautiful condition is equivalent to (x+y)^2=bx+y with 1≤x<b and 0≤y<b.

From (x+y)^2=bx+y we set s=x+y, so s^2=bx+y and hence x(b−1)=s(s−1).  Thus every solution arises from an integer s∈{2,…,b−1} for which (b−1) divides s(s−1).
