Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: A positive integer n is b-beautiful if when written in base b it has two digits summing to √n. Writing n=xb+y with 1≤x< b and 0≤y< b, the condition x+y=√n implies n=(x+y)² and simultaneously n=xb+y, so b=( (x+y)²−y )/x. Counting solutions for fixed b leads to the formula that the number of b-beautiful n equals 2^{ω(b−1)}−1, where ω(m) is the number of distinct primes dividing m. We need 2^{ω(b−1)}−1>10 ⇒ 2^{ω(b−1)}>11 ⇒ ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210=2·3·5·7, giving b−1=210 ⇒ b=211. No smaller b−1 has four distinct primes, so the least base is 211.
