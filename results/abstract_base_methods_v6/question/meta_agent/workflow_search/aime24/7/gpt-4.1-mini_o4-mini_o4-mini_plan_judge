Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_7
proposed answer: From the given ln(x)=0.428 and ln(y)=2.791, we have xy = e^{ln(x)+ln(y)} = e^{0.428+2.791} = e^{3.219} = 25 exactly. Direct substitution into the original equations confirms both logarithmic expressions equal 10 and the condition x,y>1 holds, so xy=25 is the correct and consistent result.
