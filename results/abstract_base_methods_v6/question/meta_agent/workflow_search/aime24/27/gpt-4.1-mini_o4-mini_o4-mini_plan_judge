Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_15_27
proposed answer: We have from sub-task 6 that Q = 5 and R = 694. The problem asks for Q + R. Summing these gives 5 + 694 = 699.

Answer:699
Extracted answer: 699
Correct answer: 699
