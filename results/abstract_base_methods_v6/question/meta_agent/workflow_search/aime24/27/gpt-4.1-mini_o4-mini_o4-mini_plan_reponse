        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The sub-task asks to explicitly state all the constraints on N. We know N must be a four-digit integer, so its value lies between 1000 and 9999 inclusive. The key property is that for each of its four digits, if that single digit is replaced by 1 (while leaving the other three digits unchanged), the new number must be divisible by 7. Thus the constraints are: (1) N is in [1000,9999]; (2) For each digit position i (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing the digit in position i with 1 yields a multiple of 7.; answer - N is an integer with 1000\u2264N\u22649999 such that for every one of its four digit positions, replacing that digit by 1 (and leaving the other digits unchanged) produces a number divisible by 7.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to express N=ABCD (A\u22600) and for each digit position i replace digit i with 1. That yields four new numbers, each divisible by 7. Write each as a linear form in A,B,C,D and set \u22610 mod7. Then note 1000\u22616, 100\u22612, 10\u22613 mod7 to simplify.; answer - If N=ABCD with A\u22600, the four conditions are:\n1) Replace A: 1000\u00b71 + 100B + 10C + D \u2261 0 mod7\n2) Replace B: 1000A + 100\u00b71 + 10C + D \u2261 0 mod7\n3) Replace C: 1000A + 100B + 10\u00b71 + D \u2261 0 mod7\n4) Replace D: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 \u2261 0 mod7\nSimplified using 1000\u22616, 100\u22612, 10\u22613 mod7:\n1) 6 + 2B + 3C + D \u2261 0 mod7\n2) 6A + 2 + 3C + D \u2261 0 mod7\n3) 6A + 2B + 3 + D \u2261 0 mod7\n4) 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 \u2261 0 mod7\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We start from the four replacement numbers given in Sub-task 2 and reduce their coefficients mod 7 using 1000\u22616, 100\u22612, and 10\u22613 (mod 7). For each position replaced by 1, we collect the constant term and the coefficients of A, B, C, D and set the sum \u2261 0 (mod 7).; answer - 1) Replace A: 6 + 2B + 3C + D \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n2) Replace B: 6A + 2 + 3C + D \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n3) Replace C: 6A + 2B + 3 + D \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n4) Replace D: 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Starting from the four congruences in subtask 3: 6+2B+3C+D\u22610, 6A+2+3C+D\u22610, 6A+2B+3+D\u22610, 6A+2B+3C+1\u22610 (mod 7), we reduce 6\u2261\u20131 and rewrite:\n 1) 2B+3C+D\u22611\n 2) \u2013A+3C+D\u22615\n 3) \u2013A+2B+D\u22614\n 4) \u2013A+2B+3C\u22616.\nSubtracting (1) from (2),(3),(4) gives the simpler system:\n  A+2B\u22613,\n  A+3C\u22614,\n  A+ D\u22612,\n  2B+3C+D\u22611   (all mod 7).\nSolving step by step under digit bounds (A\u22081\u20269, B,C,D\u22080\u20269) forces A=5, B=6, D=4, and C\u22612 (mod 7), hence C=2 or 9.; answer - The modular equations are:\n  A + 2B \u2261 3  (mod 7),\n  A + 3C \u2261 4  (mod 7),\n  A +   D \u2261 2  (mod 7),\n 2B + 3C + D \u2261 1  (mod 7).\nUnder digits A\u22081\u20269, B,C,D\u22080\u20269, the unique solution is A=5, B=6, D=4, and C\u22612 (mod 7) \u21d2 C=2 or 9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From subtask 4 we deduced the digits A=5, B=6, D=4, and the digit C must satisfy C\u22612 (mod 7), so C\u2208{2,9}. This gives two candidate numbers: 5624 and 5694. We test each by changing each digit in turn to 1 and checking divisibility by 7:\n\nFor N=5624:\n\u2022 Change A\u21921: 1624\u00f77=232\n\u2022 Change B\u21921: 5124\u00f77=732\n\u2022 Change C\u21921: 5614\u00f77=802\n\u2022 Change D\u21921: 5621\u00f77=803\nAll results are integers, so 5624 works.\n\nFor N=5694:\n\u2022 Change A\u21921: 1694\u00f77=242\n\u2022 Change B\u21921: 5194\u00f77=742\n\u2022 Change C\u21921: 5614\u00f77=802\n\u2022 Change D\u21921: 5691\u00f77=813\nAll results are integers as well, so 5694 works.\n\nBetween the two valid candidates, 5694 is the larger four-digit number. Therefore, the greatest N satisfying the property is 5694.; answer - 5694\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We have N=5694 from subtask 5. Dividing by 1000 gives integer quotient Q = floor(5694/1000) = 5 and remainder R = 5694 - 5*1000 = 694.; answer - Q=5, R=694\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - We have from sub-task 6 that Q = 5 and R = 694. The problem asks for Q + R. Summing these gives 5 + 694 = 699.; answer - 699"
