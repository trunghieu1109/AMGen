        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We note that in a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with AB\u2225DE, BC\u2225EF, CD\u2225FA (i.e. each side parallel to the side three steps away), the side\u2013vector sequence (taken in order) must satisfy v1+v2+v3+v4+v5+v6=0 and v4=\u2013v1, v5=\u2013v2, v6=\u2013v3. Hence v1+v2+v3=0. Geometrically this means there are exactly three directions for the sides (each repeated twice, in opposite senses), and the three non-repeated directions sum to zero as vectors. Thus the hexagon is centrally symmetric (180\u00b0 rotational symmetry) and equilateral, and its consecutive sides go along three lines whose directions differ by 120\u00b0 (in the affine sense). Equivalently, ABCDEF is an affine image of a regular hexagon, with opposite sides parallel and all sides equal.; answer - The parallelism of opposite sides forces the six side vectors to occur in three pairs of equal-and-opposite vectors, so that v1+v2+v3+v4+v5+v6=0 with v4=\u2212v1, v5=\u2212v2, v6=\u2212v3. Hence v1+v2+v3=0 and the hexagon is centrally symmetric and equilateral, an affine image of the regular hexagon: its sides lie in just three directions (each repeated twice, opposite each other) whose vector sum is zero.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we have v1+v2+v3+v4+v5+v6=0 with v4=\u2212v1, v5=\u2212v2, v6=\u2212v3 and |v1|=|v2|=|v3|=|v4|=|v5|=|v6|=s (the common side length). Hence v1+v2+v3=0. Three nonzero vectors of equal length summing to zero must be 120\u00b0 apart.  Concretely one may choose unit vectors u,v,w in the plane with u+v+w=0 (angles of 120\u00b0 between them).  Then the only way to get side\u2010length s and opposite parallelism is; answer - Let s be the common side length.  Choose unit vectors u,v,w in the plane with u+v+w=0 (so each pair makes a 120\u00b0 angle).  Then the side vectors of ABCDEF are\naB=v1=s\u00b7u,\nBC=v2=s\u00b7v,\nCD=v3=s\u00b7w,\nDE=v4=\u2212s\u00b7u,\nEF=v5=\u2212s\u00b7v,\nFA=v6=\u2212s\u00b7w.\nThese satisfy |vi|=s, opposite sides parallel, and v1+v2+v3=0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we know the hexagon\u2019s side vectors are v1=s\u00b7u, v2=s\u00b7v, v3=s\u00b7w, v4=\u2212s\u00b7u, v5=\u2212s\u00b7v, v6=\u2212s\u00b7w with u+v+w=0 and |u|=|v|=|w|=1, so the three distinct directions are u, v, and w at 120\u00b0. In particular AB\u2225u, CD\u2225w, EF\u2225\u2212v.  To analyze the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF we need explicit line\u2010equations.  The most concise form is parametric:  Line AB: X=A+t\u00b7u,  Line CD: X=C+t\u00b7w,  Line EF: X=E\u2212t\u00b7v  (t\u2208\u211d), which encodes both direction and the unknown intercept point.  For metric computations one often fixes an orthonormal basis with u=(1,0), v=(\u2013\u00bd,\u221a3/2), w=(\u2013\u00bd,\u2013\u221a3/2).  Then writing A=(x\u2081,y\u2081), C=(x\u2083,y\u2083), E=(x\u2085,y\u2085) gives the slope\u2013intercept forms  AB: y=y\u2081,  CD: y\u2013y\u2083=\u221a3(x\u2013x\u2083),  EF: y\u2013y\u2085=\u2013\u221a3(x\u2013x\u2085).  This captures the 120\u00b0 spacing and parallelism and sets up for computing their intersection distances.; answer - AB is parallel to u, CD is parallel to w, and EF is parallel to \u2013v, where u+v+w=0 and |u|=|v|=|w|=1 (120\u00b0 apart).  Their extension lines can be written in parametric vector form as:\n  Line AB: X=A+t\u00b7u,\n  Line CD: X=C+t\u00b7w,\n  Line EF: X=E\u2212t\u00b7v,\nwith t\u2208\u211d.\n\nIn a concrete orthonormal coordinate system one may choose\n  u=(1,0),  v=(\u2013\u00bd,\u221a3/2),  w=(\u2013\u00bd,\u2013\u221a3/2),\nand denote A=(x\u2081,y\u2081), C=(x\u2083,y\u2083), E=(x\u2085,y\u2085).

Call P=AB\u2229CD, Q=CD\u2229EF, R=EF\u2229AB.

Finally one substitutes  \n   C=A + s\u00b7(u+v),   E=A + s\u00b7(v+w)  \n(and hence x\u2083,y\u2083,x\u2085,y\u2085 in terms of x\u2081,y\u2081 and s) into the distance\u2010formulas.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Subtask 1 output: thinking - We are asked to analyze an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel.  Label the consecutive side\u2010vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length s, and note that AB\u2225DE, BC\u2225EF, CD\u2225FA.  Parallelism means DE=\u2013AB, EF=\u2013BC, FA=\u2013CD.  Summing all six vectors gives 0, or equivalently (AB+CD+EF)+(BC+DE+FA)=0, but since BC+DE+FA=\u2013(AB+CD+EF), we get AB+CD+EF=0.  Thus the three vectors AB, CD, EF form a closed triangle when placed head to tail.  Their lengths (200,\u2009240,\u2009300) and directions are exactly those of that triangle\u2019s sides.  The remaining three sides BC, DE, FA are parallel to EF, AB, CD respectively and point in the opposite directions.  Hence the hexagon\u2019s edges alternate among three fixed directions (the directions of the triangle\u2019s sides), each pair of opposite sides sharing one of those directions.  Geometrically, this shows the hexagon is an affine image of a regular hexagon, with its six equal sides directed in three directions whose unit\u2010vectors sum to zero.; answer - All side\u2010vectors are equal in length and come in three directions.  If we call u, v, w the unit\u2010vectors parallel to AB, CD, EF, then opposite sides are DE=\u2013AB (\u2225u), FA=\u2013CD (\u2225v), and BC=\u2013EF (\u2225w).  Convexity and equilateral\u2010side condition force AB+CD+EF=0, so u, v, w themselves form the sides of a triangle of lengths 200, 240, 300.  Thus the hexagon\u2019s sides alternate among those three directions (u, v, w, \u2013u, \u2013v, \u2013w), making it an affine\u2010regular hexagon whose side\u2010direction vectors sum to zero.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 2 output: thinking - We label unit vectors u\u2225AB, v\u2225CD, w\u2225EF and set each side\u2010vector to have length s.

Finally the closed\u2010polygon condition AB+BC+CD+DE+EF+FA=0 is automatic and the triangle condition AB+CD+EF=0 gives u+v+w=0.; answer - AB = s\u00b7u, BC = \u2013s\u00b7w, CD = s\u00b7v, DE = \u2013s\u00b7u, EF = s\u00b7w, FA = \u2013s\u00b7v\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 3 output: thinking - We need a concrete coordinate model satisfying u+v+w=0 and the triangle sides AB=200, CD=240, EF=300.

From the y\u2010equation we get b=s\u2212a, and the x\u2010equation yields a=2s, b=\u2212s, so\n    Q=(499s/240+2s\u00b719/240,\n       s\u03b2+2s\u00b7\u03b2) = (537s/240,3s\u03b2) = (179s/80,3s\u03b2).\n\nDistances:\n PQ = distance P\u2192Q = s\u00b7\u221a((179/80\u22122)\u00b2 + (3\u03b2)\u00b2)\n      = s\u00b7\u221a((19/80)\u00b2 +9(1\u2212(19/240)\u00b2)) =3s.\n PR = distance P\u2192R = |2s\u2212(\u2212s)|=3s.\n QR = distance Q\u2192R = s\u00b7\u221a((179/80+1)\u00b2 + (3\u03b2)\u00b2)\n      = s\u00b7\u221a((259/80)\u00b2 +9(1\u2212(19/240)\u00b2)) = s\u00b7\u221a(777/40).\n\nThus the intersection coordinates and side lengths are as claimed.; answer - P=(2s,0), Q=(179s/80,3s\u03b2), R=(\u2212s,0) with \u03b2=\u221a(1\u2212(19/240)\u00b2); and\nPQ(s)=3s, QR(s)=\u221a(777/40)\u00b7s, RP(s)=3s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 5a output: thinking - From the previous subtask we found PQ(s)=\u03b1\u2081s with \u03b1\u2081=3, QR(s)=\u03b1\u2082s with \u03b1\u2082=\u221a(777/40), and RP(s)=\u03b1\u2083s with \u03b1\u2083=3.  Subtask 5a asks us to set each of these expressions equal to the given side lengths 200, 240, and 300.  Hence we obtain three algebraic equations in the single variable s: 3s=200, \u221a(777/40)\u00b7s=240, and 3s=300.; answer - The system is\n3s = 200\n\u221a(777/40)\u00b7s = 240\n3s = 300\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 5b output: thinking - We have three equations for s derived from extending sides AB, CD, and EF of the hexagon:\n  1) 3s = 200  \u21d2 s = 200/3 \u2248 66.67\n  2) \u221a(777/40)\u00b7s = 240 \u21d2 s = 240\u00b7\u221a(40/777) \u2248 54.44\n  3) 3s = 300  \u21d2 s = 100\nThese three values are mutually incompatible. Since all three were claimed to follow from the same hexagon configuration, at least one of the coefficients must have been miscomputed. As written, the system has no common solution, so there is no real numeric value s satisfying all three simultaneously.; answer - No solution exists\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 6 output: thinking - We have PQ(s)=3s, QR(s)=\u221a(777/40)\u00b7s, and RP(s)=3s. To match the given triangle side lengths 200, 240, and 300, we would need\n  3s=200 \u21d2 s=200/3\u224866.67,\n  \u221a(777/40)\u00b7s=240 \u21d2 s=240\u00b7\u221a(40/777)\u224854.44,\n  3s=300 \u21d2 s=100.\nThese three values of s are distinct and thus no single s satisfies all three equations simultaneously. Substitution therefore fails to produce a consistent solution, confirming that there is no valid s making PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300 in the derived configuration.; answer - No solution exists"
