Label the consecutive side‐vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length s, and note that AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA.  Parallelism means DE=–AB, EF=–BC, FA=–CD.  Summing all six vectors gives 0, or equivalently (AB+CD+EF)+(BC+DE+FA)=0, but since BC+DE+FA=–(AB+CD+EF), we get AB+CD+EF=0.  Thus the three vectors AB, CD, EF form a closed triangle when placed head to tail.  Their lengths (200,\u2009240,\u2009300) and directions are exactly those of that triangle’s sides.  The remaining three sides BC, DE, FA are parallel to EF, AB, CD respectively and point in the opposite directions.  Hence the hexagon’s edges alternate among three fixed directions (the directions of the triangle’s sides), each pair of opposite sides sharing one of those directions.  Geometrically, this shows the hexagon is an affine image of a regular hexagon, with its six equal sides directed in three directions whose unit‐vectors sum to zero.; answer - All side‐vectors are equal in length and come in three directions.  If we call u, v, w the unit‐vectors parallel to AB, CD, EF, then opposite sides are DE=–AB (∥u), FA=–CD (∥v), and BC=–EF (∥w).  Convexity and equilateral‐side condition force AB+CD+EF=0, so u, v, w themselves form the sides of a triangle of lengths 200, 240, 300.
