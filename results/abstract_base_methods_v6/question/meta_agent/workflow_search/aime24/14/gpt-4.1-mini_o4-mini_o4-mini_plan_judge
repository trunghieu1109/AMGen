Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_14
proposed answer: We have BD^2=176·sec^2β−96 with the constraint |sinβ|≥5/6, implying sec^2β≥36/11, so the infimum of BD^2 is 176·(36/11)−96=(6336/11)−96=5280/11=480. This value is not attained by any nondegenerate rhombus, so the greatest real number less than all BD^2 is 480.
