Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_8
proposed answer: We need to count positive n ≤2024 with n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Count of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is ⌊2024/5⌋=404. Count of integers ≡2 mod 5 up to 2024: they form 2,7,…,2022, giving ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=⌊2022/5⌋+1=404+1=405. Total positions =404+405=809.
