Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: To have exactly four direction changes, a path must consist of five runs (segments) of moves alternating between R and U. There are two possible start‐move patterns:

1. R–U–R–U–R
   • The three R–runs (r1,r2,r3) are positive and sum to 8: number of solutions = C(8−1,3−1) = C(7,2) = 21.
   • The two U–runs (u1,u2) are positive and sum to 8: number of solutions = C(8−1,2−1) = C(7,1) = 7.
   • Total paths for this pattern = 21×7 = 147.

2. U–R–U–R–U
   • The three U–runs sum to 8: C(7,2) = 21 ways.
   • The two R–runs sum to 8: C(7,1) = 7 ways.
   • Total paths for this pattern = 21×7 = 147.

Since each run‐length distribution uniquely determines a path, we add the two pattern counts: 147 + 147 = 294.

Answer:The total number of such paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
Extracted answer: The total number of such paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
Correct answer: 294
