From Sub-task 2 we know r^2=(x^2+y^2+z^2)/4.

However, it omits verifying that (x,y,z) lie in the physically admissible domain (x,y,z>0) and that the feasible set is compact so a global maximum exists. It also does not address whether the maximum occurs at a critical point (e.g. via Lagrange multipliers) or on the boundary of that domain, nor does it exploit any symmetry (like possibly two sides being equal) to simplify the search.; answer: The limitation is that while rewriting r²=D/4 and casting the problem as “maximize D subject to the two constraints” is formally valid, this reduction alone does not guarantee existence, uniqueness, or location (interior vs. boundary) of the maximal solution within the positive‐orthant feasible region.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent JIeI, refining problem reduction, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we have the two algebraic constraints on the side‐lengths x,y,z: 2(xy+yz+zx)=54 and xyz=23.
