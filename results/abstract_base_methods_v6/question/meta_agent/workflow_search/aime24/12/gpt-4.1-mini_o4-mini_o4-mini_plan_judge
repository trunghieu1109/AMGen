Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: We derived that the real part simplifies to 540·cos(θ+δ), where δ is a constant shift. Since the cosine function has a maximum value of 1, the maximum of 540·cos(θ+δ) is 540·1 = 540.
