Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous steps we have x=2^(–7/24), y=2^(–3/8), z=2^(–5/12). Then log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4·(–7/24) + 3·(–3/8) + 2·(–5/12) = –25/8. Taking absolute value gives 25/8, so m = 25 and n = 8. Therefore m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

proposed answer: From the previous result, |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = 25/8, so m = 25 and n = 8. Their sum is 25 + 8 = 33.
