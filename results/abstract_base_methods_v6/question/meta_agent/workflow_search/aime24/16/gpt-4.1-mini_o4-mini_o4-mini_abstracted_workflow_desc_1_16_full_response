Since OA = R and OI² = R(R – 2r), we have IA² = R² – R(R – 2r) = 2Rr. On the other hand IA = r / sin(A/2), so (r / sin(A/2))² = 2Rr ⇒ sin²(A/2) = r/(2R). Meanwhile the half‐angle formula in triangle ABC yields sin²(A/2) = ((s–b)(s–c)) / (bc), where b = AC, c = AB, and s = (a + b + c)/2. Equating these two expressions for sin²(A/2) gives (s–b)(s–c) = bc · r/(2R). This relation involves only the sides b and c (and the semiperimeter s, which still contains a), so by itself it does not determine the product bc uniquely without further information, reflecting a limitation: we need another independent relation to solve for AB·AC.; answer - (s–b)(s–c) = bc · r/(2R),  where b = AC, c = AB, and s = (a + b + c)/2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - First, from Sub-task 2 we have IA⊥OI, so in triangle AIO: OA² = IA² + OI².  Since OA=R=13 and OI²=R(R–2r)=13·(13–12)=13, we get IA²=169–13=156, hence IA=2√39.  But IA=r/sin(A/2), so sin(A/2)=r/IA=6/(2√39)=3/√39=√(3/13).  Thus sin\u2009A=2sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2√(3/13)√(10/13)=2√30/13, and cos\u2009A=1–2sin²(A/2)=1–6/13=7/13.  By the extended law of sines, BC=a=2R\u2009sin\u2009A=26·(2√30/13)=4√30.

The condition IA ⟂ OI means IA⃗ · OI⃗ = 0. In coordinates, if we place O at the origin so O⃗=(0,0), write I⃗=(x_I,y_I) and A⃗=(x_A,y_A), then IA⃗=(x_A–x_I, y_A–y_I) and OI⃗=(x_I,y_I), giving the algebraic equation (x_A–x_I)x_I + (y_A–y_I)y_I = 0.; answer: Let O⃗=(0,0), I⃗=(x_I,y_I), A⃗=(x_A,y_A).

A clean way is to place the circumcenter O at the origin of a vector coordinate system. Then the position vectors of A and I with respect to O are \\vec{OA}=\\mathbf{a} and \\vec{OI}=\\mathbf{i}. The vector from I to A is \\vec{IA}=\\vec{OA}-\\vec{OI}=\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{i}. Perpendicularity of IA and OI means their dot product is zero: (\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{i})\\cdot\\mathbf{i}=0.

Since OA=R and OI²=R(R–2r), we get IA²=R²–R(R–2r)=2Rr. On the other hand, in any triangle AI = r/ sin(A/2). Hence (r/ sin(A/2))²=2Rr, giving sin²(A/2)=r/(2R). But we also have the standard identity sin²(A/2)=(s–b)(s–c)/(bc) where b=AC, c=AB, s=(a+b+c)/2. Equating these yields (s–b)(s–c)=bc⋅r/(2R).; answer: From IA⊥OI we get sin²(A/2)=r/(2R).  Substituting into sin²(A/2)=(s–b)(s–c)/(bc) (with b=AC, c=AB, s=(a+b+c)/2) gives  (s–b)(s–c)=bc⋅r/(2R).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent yWwe, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation correctly applies IA⊥OI to get IA²=2Rr, then IA=r/ sin(A/2) to obtain sin²(A/2)=r/(2R), and finally uses sin²(A/2)=(s–b)(s–c)/(bc) to derive (s–b)(s–c)=bc·r/(2R). However, this yields only one relation between b=AC and c=AB (still involving a through s=(a+b+c)/2) and so cannot by itself determine the product bc. It also implicitly assumes a nondegenerate triangle and that ∠A allows IA⊥OI to occur. Without an additional independent equation or numerical input, AB·AC remains undetermined.; answer: The relation (s–b)(s–c)=bc·r/(2R) is valid but insufficient: it gives just one equation in b and c (with s still containing side a), so one more relation is needed to solve for AB·AC uniquely; it also presumes the perpendicularity condition is applicable in a real triangle.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent h6dI, refining expressions for AB and AC, thinking: We start from the perpendicularity IA ⟂ OI, which in triangle AIO gives OA² = IA² + OI². Since OA = R and OI² = R(R – 2r), we have IA² = R² – R(R – 2r) = 2Rr. On the other hand IA = r / sin(A/2), so (r / sin(A/2))² = 2Rr ⇒ sin²(A/2) = r/(2R). Meanwhile the half‐angle formula in triangle ABC yields sin²(A/2) = ((s–b)(s–c)) / (bc), where b = AC, c = AB, and s = (a + b + c)/2. Equating these two expressions for sin²(A/2) gives (s–b)(s–c) = bc · r/(2R). This relation involves only the sides b and c (and the semiperimeter s, which still contains a), so by itself it does not determine the product bc uniquely without further information, reflecting a limitation: we need another independent relation to solve for AB·AC.; answer: (s–b)(s–c) = bc · r/(2R),  where b = AC, c = AB, and s = (a + b + c)/2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent sRzu, apply Law of Cosines to express AB·AC, thinking: We know from IA⊥OI that IA²=2Rr so sin²(A/2)=r/(2R)=6/(2·13)=3/13, hence cos\u2009A=1–2·(3/13)=7/13 and sin\u2009A=2√(3/13)√(10/13)=2√30/13. Then a=BC=2R\u2009sin\u2009A=2·13·(2√30/13)=4√30.\n\nNext use K=abc/(4R) and K=rs. Equating gives (1/2)\u2009bc\u2009sin\u2009A=r·(a+b+c)/2.  Substituting values yields one relation between b+c and bc.  Law of cosines a²=b²+c²–2bc\u2009cos\u2009A gives a second relation.  Writing (b+c)²=b²+c²+2bc and substituting a² and cos\u2009A leads to two equations in b+c and bc.  Eliminating b+c gives a quadratic in bc whose positive root is bc=468.; answer: Applying the Law of Cosines and area–inradius relations one finds AB·AC = 468.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 7MuL, apply Law of Cosines to express AB·AC, thinking: We know from Sub‐task 3 that (s–b)(s–c)=bc·(r/(2R)), and from Sub‐task 2 that ∠A satisfies sin²(A/2)=r/(2R), so cos A=1–2sin²(A/2)=7/13 and a=BC=2R·sin A=4√30.  Let b=AC, c=AB, p=b+c, q=bc, and s=(a+p)/2.  \n\n1) Semiperimeter/area relation: area=rs=6s and also area=(1/2)bc·sin A=bc·(√30/13), so 6s=(√30/13)q ⇒ s=(√30/78)q ⇒ (a+p)=2s ⇒ a+p=(√30/39)q ⇒ p=(√30/39)q–a.\n\n2) Law of Cosines on side a: a²=b²+c²–2bc·cos A ⇒ p²–2q–(14/13)q=480 ⇒ 13p²–40q=6240.\n\nSubstitute p from (1) into (2), clear denominators, and simplify: one finds q(q–468)=0 ⇒ q=468 (rejecting q=0).  \n\nThus AB·AC=bc=468.; answer: AB·AC = 468\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Z7GA, apply Law of Cosines to express AB·AC, thinking: First, from Sub-task 2 we have IA⊥OI, so in triangle AIO: OA² = IA² + OI².

Thus sin\u2009A=2sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2√(3/13)√(10/13)=2√30/13, and cos\u2009A=1–2sin²(A/2)=1–6/13=7/13.  By the extended law of sines, BC=a=2R\u2009sin\u2009A=26·(2√30/13)=4√30.
