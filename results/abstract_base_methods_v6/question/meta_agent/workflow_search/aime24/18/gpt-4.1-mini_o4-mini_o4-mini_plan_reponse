Write P=(a,0) and Q=(0,b) with a,b\u22650.  The distance PQ=\u221a[(a\u22120)^2+(0\u2212b)^2]=\u221a(a^2+b^2) must equal 1.  Hence a^2+b^2=1.  Conversely, any (a,b) with a,b\u22650 and a^2+b^2=1 gives such a segment.  We can also parametrize by an angle \u03b8\u2208[0,\u03c0/2], setting a=cos\u2009\u03b8, b=sin\u2009\u03b8.; answer - The family F consists of all segments joining P=(a,0) to Q=(0,b) with a,b\u22650 and satisfying a^2+b^2=1.  Equivalently, parametrize by \u03b8\u2208[0,\u03c0/2] as P=(cos\u2009\u03b8,0), Q=(0,sin\u2009\u03b8).  The required relation is a^2+b^2=1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To parametrize the segment AB, we use linear interpolation between A and B.  If we set a parameter t so that t=0 gives A and t=1 gives B, then any point C on the open segment AB (excluding endpoints) is C(t)=A+(B\u2212A)t.  Substituting A=(1/2,0) and B=(0,\u221a3/2) gives:\n\nx_C=(1\u2212t)\u22c5(1/2)+t\u22c50=(1\u2212t)/2,\ny_C=(1\u2212t)\u22c50+t\u22c5(\u221a3/2)=(\u221a3/2)t,\n\nwith 0<t<1.; answer - C(t)=((1\u2212t)/2, (\u221a3/2) t), for 0<t<1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To characterize when C on AB also lies on another unit\u2010length segment PQ with P=(a,0), Q=(0,b), we need (i) C is a strict convex combination of P and Q, (ii) P and Q satisfy a^2+b^2=1, and (iii) PQ is not the same as AB.  The equalities (1\u2212t)/2=(1\u2212\u03bb)a and (\u221a3/2)t=\u03bbb plus 0<\u03bb<1 and a^2+b^2=1 encode (i) and (ii), but we must add (iii) by excluding the trivial choice a=1/2, b=\u221a3/2 (the endpoints of AB).  Hence the precise condition is as follows:; answer - C lies on some segment PQ\u2208F other than AB if and only if there exist a,b>0 and \u03bb with 0<\u03bb<1 such that\na^2+b^2=1,\n(1\u2212t)/2=(1\u2212\u03bb)a,\n(\u221a3/2)t=\u03bbb,\nand (a,b)\u2260(1/2,\u2009\u221a3/2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We parameterize C on AB by C(t)=((1\u2212t)/2, (\u221a3/2)t).  By Sub-task 3, C lies on another unit segment PQ iff there is \u03bb\u2208(0,1) and (a,b) with a\u00b2+b\u00b2=1 satisfying (1\u2212t)/2=(1\u2212\u03bb)a and (\u221a3 t)/2=\u03bb b.  Eliminating a,b gives a quartic in X=\u03bb whose roots include X=t (the trivial AB\u2010segment).  Requiring this root to be double forces the quartic and its derivative to vanish at X=t, leading to t(4t\u00b2\u22127t+3)=0.  Rejecting t=0,1 yields t=3/4.  Hence C=((1\u22123/4)/2,(\u221a3/2)(3/4))=(1/8,3\u221a3/8).; answer - (1/8, 3\u221a3/8)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the work in Sub-tasks 4 and previous calculations, we have the unique point C = (1/8, 3\u221a3/8) on segment AB.
