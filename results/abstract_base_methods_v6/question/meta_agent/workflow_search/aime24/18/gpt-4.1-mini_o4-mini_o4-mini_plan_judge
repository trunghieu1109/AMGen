Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: From the work in Sub-tasks 4 and previous calculations, we have the unique point C = (1/8, 3√3/8) on segment AB.  Computing OC² gives (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.  Thus in lowest terms p = 7 and q = 16, which are relatively prime.  Therefore p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.
