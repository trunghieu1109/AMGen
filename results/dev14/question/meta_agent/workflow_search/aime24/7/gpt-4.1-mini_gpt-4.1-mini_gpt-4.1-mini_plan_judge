Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: We have the values x ≈ 1.535 and y ≈ 16.29 from the previous sub-task, which satisfy the system of equations derived from the original logarithmic equations: y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. The product xy is then approximately 1.535 * 16.29 = 25. This matches the derived relation y = 25 / x, confirming consistency. To verify, substitute back into the original logarithmic equations: log_x(y^x) = log_x(x^{10}) = 10, and log_y(x^{4y}) = log_y(y^{10}) = 10, both hold true. The domain conditions x > 1 and y > 1 are also satisfied. Potential errors could arise from rounding during numerical approximation, but the product xy = 25 is exact from the relation y = 25 / x. Thus, the product xy = 25 is the correct and consistent solution, confirming the values found satisfy the original problem conditions.
