Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_0
proposed answer: We are given s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes from the previous sub-task. We need to find the total time (walking plus coffee shop) when Aya walks at speed s + 0.5 km/h = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. The walking distance is fixed at 9 km. The walking time at 3.0 km/h is distance/speed = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours. The coffee shop time t is 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. Therefore, the total time in hours is walking time + coffee shop time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. To convert this to minutes, multiply by 60: 3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes. Hence, the total time including the coffee shop stop when walking at 3.0 km/h is 204 minutes. This calculation is straightforward and consistent with the problem's conditions and previous results.
