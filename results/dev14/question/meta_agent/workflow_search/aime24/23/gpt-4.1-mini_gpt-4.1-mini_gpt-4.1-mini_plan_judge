Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We are given a 2x3 grid with digits a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. The conditions are: the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. From the problem and the example, leading zeros are allowed. The equations derived are: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8, d + e + f = 19. Since d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, and digits are from 0 to 9, a,b,c must be between 0 and 8 to keep d,e,f valid digits. The sum a + b + c = 8 means we need to count the number of nonnegative integer solutions to this equation with each variable ≤ 8. Since 8 is small, the upper bound does not restrict the count here. The number of solutions to a + b + c = 8 with a,b,c ≥ 0 is given by the stars and bars theorem: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c), which are valid digits. Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) satisfying all constraints is 45. This count includes all possible assignments without duplicates and respects all digit constraints and sum conditions.

proposed answer: We start with the problem constraints and the derived system of equations involving the digits a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row of the 2x3 grid. The key equations are:

1) a + d = 9
2) b + e = 9
3) c + f = 9
4) a + b + c + c3 = 9
5) d + e + f = 9 + 10*c3

Since digits are from 0 to 9, and carries are 0 or 1, we analyze the possible values of c3.

From equations (1)-(3), summing gives (a+b+c) + (d+e+f) = 27.
Using equation (5), d+e+f = 9 + 10*c3, so:
(a+b+c) + (9 + 10*c3) = 27
=> a + b + c = 18 - 10*c3

From equation (4), a + b + c + c3 = 9
Substitute a + b + c from above:
18 - 10*c3 + c3 = 9
18 - 9*c3 = 9
9*c3 = 9
c3 = 1

Therefore, c3 = 1, and a + b + c = 8.

For each digit triple (a,b,c) with digits 0..9 and sum 8, we compute d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c. Since a,b,c ≤ 8, d,e,f will be digits 0..9.

The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Each such triple corresponds to a unique (d,e,f), and the carry variables are c1=0, c2=0, c3=1, c4=0.

All constraints are satisfied, including the sum of the two 3-digit numbers being 999 and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers being 99.

Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) satisfying all conditions is 45.

This enumeration is complete, respects all digit and carry constraints, and matches the example given in the problem statement. There is no double counting or omission because each (a,b,c) triple uniquely determines (d,e,f).

Therefore, the final answer is 45.
