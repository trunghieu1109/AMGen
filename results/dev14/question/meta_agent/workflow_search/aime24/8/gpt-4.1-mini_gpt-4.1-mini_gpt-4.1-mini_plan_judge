Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The problem is to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob, the second player, can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if and only if the initial position (n tokens) is losing for Alice. A position is losing if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent. The allowed moves are removing 1 or 4 tokens. Starting from the base case n=0 (losing), we classify positions as winning or losing by checking if there exists a move to a losing position. By analyzing the first few positions, we find the pattern of losing positions: n mod 5 = 0 or 2. This pattern repeats every 5 tokens because the moves 1 and 4 correspond to steps modulo 5. To count the losing positions up to 2024, we count numbers n ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 = 0 or 2. The count of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The count of numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to 2024 is floor((2024-2)/5) + 1 = 405. Summing these gives 404 + 405 = 809. This matches the previous solutions and is consistent with the combinatorial game theory analysis. Therefore, the counting method and final count are correct and reliable.
