Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with fixed surface area 54 and volume 23. We want the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain every such box. Since the sphere must contain the entire box, its radius must be at least half the space diagonal d of the box, where d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2. The problem reduces to finding the maximum possible d^2 among all boxes satisfying the constraints, then r^2 = d^2 / 4.

From previous analysis, two candidate dimension sets were found that satisfy the constraints and the Lagrange multiplier conditions: (2, 2, 5.75) and approximately (3.898, 3.898, 1.514). Calculating d^2 for these:
- For (2, 2, 5.75): d^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625
- For (3.898, 3.898, 1.514): d^2 â‰ˆ 15.19 + 15.19 + 2.29 = 32.67

The maximum d^2 is 41.0625 from the first set. Then r^2 = 41.0625 / 4 = 10.265625.

Expressing 10.265625 as a fraction:
10.265625 = 10 + 17/64 = (640/64) + (17/64) = 657/64.

Check if 657/64 is in lowest terms:
- 657 factors as 3 * 3 * 73
- 64 is 2^6
No common factors, so fraction is reduced.

Therefore, r^2 = 657/64 and p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.

This matches the problem constraints and the logic that the sphere must cover the box with the largest space diagonal. Hence, the final answer is 721.
