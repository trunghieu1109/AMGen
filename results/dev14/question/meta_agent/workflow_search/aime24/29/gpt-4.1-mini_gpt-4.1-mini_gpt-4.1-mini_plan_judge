Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We start by considering the constraints: each cell can contain at most one chip, all chips in the same row have the same color, and all chips in the same column have the same color. This implies that if a cell is occupied, the color of the chip must be consistent with both its row and column colors. Rows and columns can be assigned one of three states: white, black, or empty (no chips). Chips are placed only at the intersections of rows and columns of the same color. The maximality condition means that no additional chip can be placed without violating the uniformity conditions. This is ensured by the fact that any empty cell either lies in a row or column that is empty or the row and column colors differ, so placing a chip there would break the uniformity. Therefore, the configurations correspond exactly to choosing color assignments for each row and column from {white, black, empty}. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, each with 3 possible states, the total number of assignments is 3^5 for rows times 3^5 for columns, which is 3^{10} = 59049. We must exclude the case where all rows and columns are empty, which corresponds to no chips placed, violating the maximality condition. Hence, the total number of valid maximal configurations is 59049 - 1 = 59048. This count accounts for all possible maximal placements of chips consistent with the problem's constraints and the indistinguishability of chips. This reasoning is consistent with the combinatorial model and the problem's conditions.

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of maximal placements of chips on a 5x5 grid under strict color uniformity constraints per row and column, with maximality meaning no additional chip can be added without violating these constraints. The key insight is that each row and column can be assigned one of three states: white, black, or empty. Occupied cells occur exactly at intersections where the row and column colors match and are nonempty. Maximality implies that all such intersections must be occupied, and no empty cell can be added without breaking uniformity. Thus, the configuration corresponds to choosing subsets of rows and columns for white and black colors, with the rest empty, and placing chips at the intersections of these subsets. The number of nonempty subsets of rows or columns is 2^5 - 1 = 31. For each color, the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns is 31^2. Including the possibility of empty subsets (no rows or no columns chosen) adds 1, so (1 + 31^2) per color. Since there are two colors, the total number of configurations is (1 + 31^2)^2. We must exclude the all-empty configuration (no rows or columns chosen for either color), so subtract 1. Therefore, the total number of valid maximal placements is (1 + (2^5 - 1)^2)^2 - 1 = (1 + 31^2)^2 - 1 = (1 + 961)^2 - 1 = 962^2 - 1 = 925,444 - 1 = 925,443. This formula correctly counts all maximal configurations, respects the indistinguishability of chips, and satisfies the problem constraints. Hence, the final answer is 925443.
