Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: To verify the final result of 294 paths with exactly 4 direction changes on an 8x8 grid, we analyze the problem step-by-step and compare with smaller cases for consistency. The problem states that each path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. Exactly 4 direction changes imply the path is composed of 5 monotone segments alternating between R and U. The number of segments for R and U depends on the starting direction. If the path starts with R, there are 3 R segments and 2 U segments; if it starts with U, there are 3 U segments and 2 R segments. The number of ways to split 8 steps into k positive parts is C(7, k-1). For starting with R, the number of ways to split R steps is C(7,2) = 21 and for U steps is C(7,1) = 7, giving 21*7=147 ways. For starting with U, the calculation is symmetric, also yielding 147 ways. Summing these gives 294. To verify, consider smaller grids: for a 2x2 grid (4 steps), paths with exactly 1 direction change (2 segments) can be counted similarly and match the combinatorial formula, confirming the approach. The reasoning aligns with known combinatorial principles about compositions and run counts in sequences. Therefore, the final result of 294 is consistent, correct, and justified by combinatorial arguments and smaller case verification.
