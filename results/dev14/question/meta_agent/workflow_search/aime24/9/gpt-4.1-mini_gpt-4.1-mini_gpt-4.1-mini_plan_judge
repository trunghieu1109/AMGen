Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are asked to find the sum m + n where m/n is the simplified fraction representing the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. 

Step 1: Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Jen's chosen 4 numbers are fixed. The random draw is also 4 numbers from the same set.

Step 3: Jen wins the grand prize if the drawn 4 numbers exactly match her 4 numbers. There is exactly 1 such way.

Step 4: Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are in the drawn 4 numbers. We need to count the number of draws with exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches.
- Exactly 2 matches: Choose 2 from Jen's 4 numbers (C(4,2) = 6) and 2 from the remaining 6 numbers (C(6,2) = 15), total 6*15 = 90 ways.
- Exactly 3 matches: Choose 3 from Jen's 4 numbers (C(4,3) = 4) and 1 from the remaining 6 numbers (C(6,1) = 6), total 4*6 = 24 ways.
- Exactly 4 matches: 1 way.

Total prize-winning ways = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Step 5: Probability of winning the grand prize = 1/210.
Probability of winning a prize = 115/210 = 23/42 after simplification.

Step 6: Conditional probability = P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210*23) = (42/210)*(1/23) = (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115.

Step 7: The fraction 1/115 is already in lowest terms, so m=1 and n=115.

Step 8: Sum m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

This step-by-step reasoning confirms the answer is 116.
