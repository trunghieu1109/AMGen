Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_26
proposed answer: From the previous analysis, we know that the total number of sets B is 2024, and this equals the sum of 2^(a-1) for all a in A. To find A, we decompose 2024 into distinct powers of two. Converting 2024 to binary gives 11111101000, which corresponds to bits set at positions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (counting from 0 at the least significant bit). Each bit position k corresponds to an element a = k + 1 in A. Therefore, A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. To find the sum of elements of A, we add these numbers: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. Hence, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
