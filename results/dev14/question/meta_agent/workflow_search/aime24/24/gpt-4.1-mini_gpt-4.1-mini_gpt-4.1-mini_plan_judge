Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous subtasks and the reasoning provided by multiple agents, the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) was found to be \( \frac{25}{8} \). The problem asks for the sum \( m + n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} = \frac{25}{8} \) is in lowest terms. Since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest form. Therefore, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), and their sum is \( 25 + 8 = 33 \). This is a straightforward arithmetic step after confirming the fraction is reduced. Hence, the final answer is 33.
