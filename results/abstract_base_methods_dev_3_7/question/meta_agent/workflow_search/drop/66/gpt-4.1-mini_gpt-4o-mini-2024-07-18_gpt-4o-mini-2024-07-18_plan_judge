Question: Passage: After periods with Shamrock Rovers, Shelbourne and University College Dublin A.F.C., Ó Snodaigh was a squad member of the successful Bray Wanderers side that won the 1989-90 FAI Cup in at Lansdowne Road with a 3-0 victory against St Francis, lost in the European Cup Winners Cup tie against Trabzonspor, and finished runners-up in the 1990-91 League of Ireland First Division. That same year he was a central member of Wanderers reserve side that finished runners-up in the League of Ireland B Division. He won the B team player of the year award in 1990 and was a member of the first team that lost the LFA President's Cup final 3-1 against Dundalk. In time he left Bray and became a member of Leinster Senior League side Pegasus where, over a seven-year period, he was a member of their FAI Intermediate Cup winning team in 1992 against Bluebell United, top scorer in 1996/7, selected for the Leinster Senior League selection team in 1992, was captain of the side that got relegated from the senior division in 1997 following a defeat away to Bluebell and played in every position for the side except goalkeeper.
Question: How many years between Ó Snodaigh's first and second FAI Cup?
Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_66
proposed answer: Ó Snodaigh's first FAI Cup win was in 1990 with Bray Wanderers. The passage does not mention any subsequent FAI Cup win by Ó Snodaigh, indicating that there is no record of a second FAI Cup win. Therefore, since there is no second win, we cannot calculate the number of years between the first and second wins. The absence of a second win means that the question of the years between the first and second FAI Cup wins is moot, leading to the conclusion that there are 0 years between them, as the second win does not exist.
