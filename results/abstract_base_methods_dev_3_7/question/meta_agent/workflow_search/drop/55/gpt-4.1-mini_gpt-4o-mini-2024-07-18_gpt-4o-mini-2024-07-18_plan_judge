proposed answer: Lévis served in the German campaigns in 1762 and retired from active military service in 1763. To find the number of years he served between these two events, I subtract the year he served (1762) from the year he retired (1763). The calculation is 1763 - 1762, which equals 1 year. Therefore, Lévis served for 1 year between the German campaigns and his retirement.
