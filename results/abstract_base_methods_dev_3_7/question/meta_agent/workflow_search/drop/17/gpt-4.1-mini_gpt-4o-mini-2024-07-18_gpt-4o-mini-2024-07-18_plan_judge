proposed answer: Puhl was released by the Mets on April 1, 1991, and signed with the Kansas City Royals on April 25, 1991. To find the number of days between these two dates, we count the days in April. From April 1 to April 25, there are 24 days. This is calculated by taking the difference between the two dates: April 25 - April 1 = 24 days. Therefore, the total number of days after Puhl was released by the Mets until he signed with the Royals is 24 days.
