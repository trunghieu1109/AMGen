Question: Passage: Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women. Life expectancy was 71.96 years for men and 79.62 years for women in 2015, growing continuously since the End of Communism in Hungary (1989).
