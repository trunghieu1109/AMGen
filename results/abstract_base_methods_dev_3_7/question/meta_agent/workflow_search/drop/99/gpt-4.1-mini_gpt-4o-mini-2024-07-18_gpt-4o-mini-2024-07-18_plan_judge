Question: Passage: Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women. Life expectancy was 71.96 years for men and 79.62 years for women in 2015, growing continuously since the End of Communism in Hungary (1989).
Question: How many years longer is the life expectancy for women compared to men?
Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_99
proposed answer: To determine how many years longer the life expectancy for women is compared to men, I need to perform a simple subtraction of the life expectancy values provided in the passage. The life expectancy for men is stated as 71.96 years, while for women it is 79.62 years. By subtracting the men's life expectancy from the women's, I calculate: 79.62 - 71.96 = 7.66 years. This calculation shows that women, on average, live 7.66 years longer than men.

Answer:7.66 years
Extracted answer: 7.66 years
Correct answer:  7.66
