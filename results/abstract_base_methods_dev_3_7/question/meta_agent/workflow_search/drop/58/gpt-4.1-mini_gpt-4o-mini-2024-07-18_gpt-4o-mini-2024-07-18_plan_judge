Question: Passage: Russia admitted that three of its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber were lost. Georgia at that time claimed it had downed at least 21 Russian aircraft. Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost. Two helicopters, a Mi-8MTKO and a Mi-24, were wrecked in an accident after the hostilities. While there are no official figures, Russian ground equipment losses in the war are estimated to be three tanks, at least 20 armoured and 32 non-armoured vehicles lost in combat. Several more vehicles were impaired in accidents. During one engagement, Georgian forces destroyed 25 out of 30 vehicles of a Russian military unit commanded by General Anatoly Khrulyov. The Russian military had no losses in the artillery, air defence and naval forces. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the five-day war cost Russia an estimated 12.5 billion rubles, a daily cost of 2.5 billion rubles. South Ossetian forces lost two BMP-2s.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_58
proposed answer: The passage provides specific estimates for the losses of Russian military vehicles during the conflict. It states that 3 tanks, at least 20 armoured vehicles, and 32 non-armoured vehicles were lost. By aggregating these numbers, we find that the total estimated losses amount to 55 vehicles. This total is derived from the sum of the individual categories: 3 (tanks) + 20 (armoured vehicles) + 32 (non-armoured vehicles) = 55. Therefore, the final decision on the estimated losses is based on these calculations and the information provided in the passage.

Answer:3 tanks, 20 armoured vehicles, and 32 non-armoured vehicles lost, totaling 55 vehicles.
