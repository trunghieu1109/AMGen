Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_32
proposed answer: To determine the number of years over which births roughly doubled in Bahrain, I need to calculate the time span from the start year of 1976 to the end year of 2011. By subtracting the start year from the end year, I find that 2011 - 1976 equals 35 years. Therefore, it took 35 years for the number of births to roughly double in Bahrain.

Answer:35 years
Extracted answer: 35 years
