proposed answer: To determine how many more households there are than families, I used the numbers provided in the passage. The number of households is 15,137 and the number of families is 10,898. By subtracting the number of families from the number of households (15,137 - 10,898), I calculated that there are 4,239 more households than families. This calculation is straightforward and directly answers the question posed.
