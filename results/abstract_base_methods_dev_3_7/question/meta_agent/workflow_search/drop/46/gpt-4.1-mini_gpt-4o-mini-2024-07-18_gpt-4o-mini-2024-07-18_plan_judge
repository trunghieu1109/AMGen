Question: Passage: Arizona dominated St Louis to win the NFC West and clinch their first home playoff game since 1947. Arizona took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter after a one-yard TD run by Tim Hightower and a Kurt Warner 12-yard TD pass to Larry Fitzgerald. In the second quarter the Rams would score on a three-yard TD pass from Marc Bulger to Steven Jackson, following a Kurt Warner interception. The Cardinals would respond with two field goals from Neil Rackers from 44 and 22 yards to make the halftime score 20-7. In the third quarter, Cardinals linebacker, Gerald Hayes, would force two Steven Jackson fumbles, the second one recovered by Darnell Dockett, who would return it 11 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. Down 27-7, the Rams attempted to come back in the fourth quarter, starting with a Josh Brown 51-yard field goal to make the score 27-10, but a Bulger pass was intercepted by rookie cornerback, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, for 99 yards, for the touchdown that sealed the game and propelled the Cardinals to their first playoff game since 1998, and their first division title since the days the Cardinals were in St. Louis in 1975.

Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_46
proposed answer: Neil Rackers made two field goals during the game: one from 44 yards and another from 22 yards. To find the total yardage made by Rackers, we need to sum these two distances. Therefore, 44 yards + 22 yards equals 66 yards. This is the total yardage that Rackers achieved in field goals during the game.
