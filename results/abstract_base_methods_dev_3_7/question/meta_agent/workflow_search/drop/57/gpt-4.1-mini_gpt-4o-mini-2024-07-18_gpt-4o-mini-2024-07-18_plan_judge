Question: Passage: Old age pensions were raised by 300 francs per month to 1,700 francs for a single person and to 3,700 francs for a couple, while health insurance benefits were made more widely available to unemployed persons and part-time employees. Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7 million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_57
proposed answer: To find out how many more francs a couple received than a single person, we need to subtract the pension amount for a single person from the pension amount for a couple. From Subtask 1, we know that the pension for a single person is 1,700 francs, and from Subtask 2, we know that the pension for a couple is 3,700 francs. Therefore, the calculation is: 3,700 francs (couple) - 1,700 francs (single) = 2,000 francs. This means a couple receives 2,000 francs more than a single person.
