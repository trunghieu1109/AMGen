Question: Passage: Coming off their impressive home win over the Buccaneers, the Texans stayed at home, donned their battle red alternates, and played a Thursday night intraconference duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Houston drew first blood as QB Sage Rosenfels got a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Broncos got on the board with kicker Jason Elam getting a 41-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Texans responded with kicker Kris Brown getting a 41-yard field goal.  Denver would end the half as Elam nailed a 47-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston replied with RB Ron Dayne getting a 6-yard TD run.  Denver would answer with QB Jay Cutler completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans pulled away as Rosenfels completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, while FB Vonta Leach managed to get a 1-yard TD run. With the win, Houston improved to 7-7. The game marked the only appearance of the Texans on primetime television of the season, their first since 2005, and the first game in 2007 played with the roof open.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_64
proposed answer: Sage Rosenfels's touchdown run was 5 yards, and Vonta Leach's touchdown run was 1 yard. To find the difference in yards between these two runs, we subtract the yardage of Vonta Leach's run from the yardage of Sage Rosenfels's run: 5 yards - 1 yard = 4 yards. Therefore, the difference in yards is 4 yards.
