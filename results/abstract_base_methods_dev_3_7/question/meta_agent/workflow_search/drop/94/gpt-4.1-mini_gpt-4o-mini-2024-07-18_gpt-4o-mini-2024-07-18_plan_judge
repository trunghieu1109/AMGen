Question: Passage: From 1989 to 1993, the Pacers would play at or near .500 and qualify for the playoffs, in 1989-90 NBA season, the Pacers parlayed a fast start into the teams third playoff appearance. But the Pacers were swept by the 1989-90 Detroit Pistons season, who would go on to win their second consecutive 1990 NBA Finals. Reggie Miller became the first Pacer to play in the 1990 NBA All-Star Game since 1976 on the strength of his 24.6 points-per-game average. Despite four straight first round exits, this period was highlighted by a first round series with the Boston Celtics in 1990-91 NBA season that went to Game 5. The next season, the Pacers returned to the playoffs in 1992 NBA Playoffs and met the 1991-92 Boston Celtics season for the second year in a row. But this time, the Celtics left no doubt who was the better team, as they swept the Pacers in three straight games. Chuck Person and point guard Micheal Williams were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the off-season, and the Pacers got Pooh Richardson and Sam Mitchell (basketball) in return. For the 1992-93 NBA season, Detlef Schrempf moved from sixth man to the starter at small forward and was elected to his first All-Star game. Miller, meanwhile, became the Pacers all-time NBA era leading scorer during this season (4th overall). The Pacers returned to the 1993 NBA Playoffs with a 41-41 record, but lost to the 1992-93 New York Knicks season in the first round, three games to one.
Question: How many years were between the last time a Pacer played in an NBA All-Star game and when Reggie Miller got to play?
Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_94
proposed answer: The last time a Pacer played in the NBA All-Star Game before Reggie Miller was in 1976, and Reggie Miller played in the All-Star Game in 1990. To find the number of years between these two events, we subtract the earlier year from the later year: 1990 - 1976 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 years between the last Pacer All-Star appearance before Miller and Reggie Miller's All-Star appearance.
