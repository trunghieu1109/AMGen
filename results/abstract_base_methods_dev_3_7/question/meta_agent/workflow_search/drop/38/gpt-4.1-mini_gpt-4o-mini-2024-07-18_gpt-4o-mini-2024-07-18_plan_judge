Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_38
proposed answer: To find out how many more people there are than housing units, I need to subtract the total number of housing units from the total number of people. From Subtask 1, I have the total number of people as 49,927. From Subtask 2, I have the total number of housing units as 24,505. Therefore, I calculate: 49,927 (people) - 24,505 (housing units) = 25,422. This means there are 25,422 more people than housing units in the county.
