Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ciBP', content="To find out how many more people, by percent, living in Springfield who were made up of two or more races were White and African American compared to White and some other race, we need to subtract the percentage of 'White and Some Other Race' from the percentage of 'White and Black or African American'.
