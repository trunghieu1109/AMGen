Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_84
proposed answer: To find out how many more people, by percent, living in Springfield who were made up of two or more races were White and African American compared to White and some other race, we need to subtract the percentage of 'White and Some Other Race' from the percentage of 'White and Black or African American'. From the previous subtasks, we have: 'White and Black or African American' is 1.5% and 'White and Some Other Race' is 1.0%. Therefore, the calculation is 1.5% - 1.0% = 0.5%. This means that there are 0.5% more people who are White and African American compared to those who are White and some other race.
