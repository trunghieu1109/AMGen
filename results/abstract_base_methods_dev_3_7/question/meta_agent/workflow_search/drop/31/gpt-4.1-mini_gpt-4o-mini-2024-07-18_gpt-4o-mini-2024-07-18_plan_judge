Question: Passage: Although it failed to dislodge the Burmese from Kengtung and Sipsongpanna at the beginning of the century , Siam never gave up its claims on these lands. They tested the waters in 1849, by raiding as far north as Kengtung. But when the Second Anglo-Burmese War started, the Siamese viewed it as their opportunity to take over the trans-Salween states. In late 1852, a large infantry and elephant force marched from Chiang Mai and launched a two-pronged invasion of Kengtung. Burma couldrespond only after the new king Mindon had seized power in February 1853. Because he was still concerned about the British threat, Mindon could only send several thousand infantry troops from the Mone  garrison to relieve the Siamese siege of Kengtung. With the troops by Kenghung sawbwa, the Burmese eventually drove out the Siamese but only after heavy loss of life. In 1854, the largest Siamese invasion force, consisted of Laotian levies, tried once more. But this time, with the British front quiet, the Burmese were ready. Mindon had deployed a larger, well-equipped army . The Siamese forces again reached Kengtung but could not break through. The Siamese forces withdrew to the border in May 1855.

Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_31
proposed answer: The passage indicates that the Siamese invasion force in 1852 included a large infantry and elephant force. However, it does not provide a specific number of elephants or any other animals. Therefore, while we can confirm that the Siamese took elephants with them, we cannot quantify the exact number. The interpretation should emphasize that there was an elephant force, but the passage lacks specific details on the count.

Answer:The Siamese took an elephant force with them in 1852.
