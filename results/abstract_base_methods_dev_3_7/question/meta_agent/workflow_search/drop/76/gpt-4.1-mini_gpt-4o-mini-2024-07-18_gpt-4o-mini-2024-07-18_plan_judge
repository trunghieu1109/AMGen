Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_76
proposed answer: To find the number of personnel who were not non-commissioned officers, we need to subtract the number of non-commissioned officers from the total number of active military personnel. From Subtask 1, we know that the total number of active military personnel is 14,506. From Subtask 2, we know that the number of non-commissioned officers is 5,389. Therefore, the calculation is: 14,506 - 5,389 = 9,117. This means there are 9,117 personnel who are not non-commissioned officers.
