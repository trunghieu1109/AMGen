Question: Passage: The Byzantine civil war of 1373-1379 was a military conflict fought in the Byzantine Empire between Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos and his son, Andronikos IV Palaiologos, also growing into an Ottoman civil war as well, when SavcÄ± Bey, the son of Ottoman Emperor Murad I joined Andronikos in a joint rebellion against their fathers. It began when Andronikos sought to overthrow his father in 1373. Although he failed, with Genoese aid, Andronikos was eventually able to overthrow and imprison John V in 1376. In 1379 however, John V escaped, and with Ottoman help, regained his throne. The civil war further weakened the declining Byzantine Empire, which had already suffered several devastating civil wars earlier in the century. The major beneficiary of the war were the Ottomans, whose vassals the Byzantines had effectively become.

proposed answer: The passage clearly indicates that John V Palaiologos was the Byzantine Emperor at the start of the civil war in 1373. Although his son, Andronikos IV Palaiologos, did manage to overthrow and imprison him in 1376, John V ultimately escaped and regained his throne in 1379 with the assistance of the Ottomans. Therefore, throughout the majority of the civil war, John V Palaiologos was the recognized leader of the Byzantine Empire, despite the brief period when Andronikos held power. This makes John V Palaiologos the correct answer to the question of who was the leader of the Byzantines during the civil war period.
