Question: Passage: Old age pensions were raised by 300 francs per month to 1,700 francs for a single person and to 3,700 francs for a couple, while health insurance benefits were made more widely available to unemployed persons and part-time employees. Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7 million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_98
proposed answer: The passage states that old age pensions were raised by 300 francs to a new amount of 1,700 francs for a single person. To find the original pension amount before the raise, we subtract the increase (300 francs) from the new amount (1,700 francs). Therefore, the calculation is 1,700 francs - 300 francs, which equals 1,400 francs. This confirms that the original pension amount for a single person was 1,400 francs.

Answer:1,400 francs
Extracted answer: 1,400 francs
Correct answer:  1400
