Question: Passage: Coming off their road win over the Titans, the Jets went home for a Week 13 duel with the Denver Broncos. The game would be moved from a 1:00 PM start time to a later time due to a more national interest in the Jets hence their 8-3 record. In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Broncos safety Vernon Fox returning a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown.  The Jets would respond with RB Thomas Jones getting a 59-yard TD run, but Denver answered with QB Jay Cutler completing a 59-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal, along with kicker Matt Prater making a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York drew close as Jones got a 29-yard TD run, yet the Broncos replied with RB Peyton Hillis getting a 1-yard TD run, along with Prater getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarer, the Jets tried to rally as kicker Jay Feely nailed a 30-yard field goal.  However, in the fourth quarter, Denver pulled away as Cutler completed a 36-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley.
Question: How many TD runs were under 10 yards?
Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_60
proposed answer: In the passage, the touchdown runs mentioned are Thomas Jones with a 59-yard TD run, and Peyton Hillis with a 1-yard TD run. Since we are specifically looking for touchdown runs that are under 10 yards, only the 1-yard TD run by Peyton Hillis qualifies. The other touchdown runs (59 yards and 29 yards) do not meet the criteria of being under 10 yards. Therefore, there is only one touchdown run under 10 yards.
