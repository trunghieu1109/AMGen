Question: Passage: Coming off their road win over the Titans, the Jets went home for a Week 13 duel with the Denver Broncos. The game would be moved from a 1:00 PM start time to a later time due to a more national interest in the Jets hence their 8-3 record.

The Jets would respond with RB Thomas Jones getting a 59-yard TD run, but Denver answered with QB Jay Cutler completing a 59-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal, along with kicker Matt Prater making a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York drew close as Jones got a 29-yard TD run, yet the Broncos replied with RB Peyton Hillis getting a 1-yard TD run, along with Prater getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarer, the Jets tried to rally as kicker Jay Feely nailed a 30-yard field goal.
