Question: Passage: Coming off their road win over the Titans, the Jets went home for a Week 13 duel with the Denver Broncos. The game would be moved from a 1:00 PM start time to a later time due to a more national interest in the Jets hence their 8-3 record. In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Broncos safety Vernon Fox returning a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown.  The Jets would respond with RB Thomas Jones getting a 59-yard TD run, but Denver answered with QB Jay Cutler completing a 59-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal, along with kicker Matt Prater making a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York drew close as Jones got a 29-yard TD run, yet the Broncos replied with RB Peyton Hillis getting a 1-yard TD run, along with Prater getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarer, the Jets tried to rally as kicker Jay Feely nailed a 30-yard field goal.  However, in the fourth quarter, Denver pulled away as Cutler completed a 36-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley.

proposed answer: In the passage, there are two touchdown passes mentioned. The first is a 59-yard touchdown pass from QB Jay Cutler of the Denver Broncos to WR Eddie Royal. The second is a 36-yard touchdown pass from the same QB, Jay Cutler, to WR Brandon Stokley. To determine which team scored the longest touchdown pass, we compare the yardages of these two passes.
