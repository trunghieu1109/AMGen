Question: Passage: After being higher in the postwar period, the U.S. unemployment rate fell below the rising eurozone unemployment rate in the mid-1980s and has remained significantly lower almost continuously since. In 1955, 55% of Americans worked in services, between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15% in Agriculture in the United States. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25% and 30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture. Male unemployment continued to be significantly higher than those of females (at 9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009). The unemployment among Caucasians continues being much lower than those for African-Americans (at 8.5% vs. 15.8% also in 2009).

Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_48
proposed answer: The unemployment rate for Caucasians in 2009 was 8.5%, while the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 15.8%. Since 15.8% is significantly higher than 8.5%, it indicates that African-Americans had a higher unemployment rate compared to Caucasians. Therefore, African-Americans were more out of work than Caucasians.

Extracted answer: African-Americans were more out of work.
