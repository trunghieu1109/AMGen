Question: Passage: The Eagles began their season at Bank of America Stadium for a Week 1 duel with the Carolina Panthers.  Philadelphia trailed early in the first quarter as Panthers running back DeAngelo Williams ran 11 yards for a Carolina touchdown on their first drive.  The Eagles answered with a 49-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. In the second quarter, Philadelphia exploded with points as defensive end Victor Abiamiri returned a fumble 2 yards for a touchdown, wide receiver DeSean Jackson returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown, and quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 9-yard TD pass to tight end Brent Celek and a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook. Carolina ended the period with kicker John Kasay booting a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Eagles closed out their scoring with McNabb scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run.  However, he was hit late by several Carolina tacklers who cracked his ribs on the right side, knocking him out of the game. Kevin Kolb came in for McNabb and closed out the game for the victorious Eagles.
Question: Who had the longer TD run, Williams or McNabb?
Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_80
proposed answer: To determine who had the longer touchdown run between Williams and McNabb, I would need to compare the specific distances of their touchdown runs. If Williams had a touchdown run of, for example, 50 yards and McNabb had a touchdown run of 30 yards, then Williams would have the longer run. The comparison is straightforward: I would look at the numerical values of their respective touchdown run distances and identify which one is greater. Without the specific distances provided in the question, I cannot definitively state who had the longer run.

Answer:Unable to determine without specific distances.
Extracted answer: Unable to determine without specific distances.
