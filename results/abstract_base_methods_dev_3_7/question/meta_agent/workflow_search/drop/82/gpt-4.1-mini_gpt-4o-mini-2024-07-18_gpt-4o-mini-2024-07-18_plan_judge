Early in the game, the Eagles offense struggled with two goal-line fumbles being recovered by the Packers.  In the first quarter, Packers kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 23-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Philadelphia would score on QB Donovan McNabb's 6-yard TD run.  However, Green Bay managed to get two more field goals, as Rayner got a 54-yarder and a 46-yarder to end the half.  In the second half, it was all Eagles, as in the third quarter, kicker David Akers got a 40-yard field goal, while McNabb and WR Greg Lewis connected on two touchdown passes of 45 and 30 yards.  In the fourth quarter, the Philly offense wrapped things up as McNabb got a 15-yard TD run, while the defense ended the game on a goal-line stand.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_82
proposed answer: To determine the total yards accumulated by Donovan McNabb on passing touchdowns, I reviewed the passage which states that he connected on two touchdown passes to WR Greg Lewis, one for 45 yards and another for 30 yards. By adding these two values together (45 + 30), I calculated that he accumulated a total of 75 yards on passing touchdowns. This matches the information given in the passage, confirming the accuracy of my calculation.
