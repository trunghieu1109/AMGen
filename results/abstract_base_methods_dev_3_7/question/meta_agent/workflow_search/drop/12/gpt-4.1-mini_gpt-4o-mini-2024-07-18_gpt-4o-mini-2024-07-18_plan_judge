Question: Passage: Coming off an easy win over the 49ers, the Seahawks flew to INVESCO Field at Mile High for an interconference duel with their former division rival, the Broncos. In the first quarter Seattle trailed early as QB Kyle Orton made a 13-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal, followed in the second quarter by RB Correll Buckhalter getting a 1-yard TD run. Then kicker Matt Prater made a 20-yard field goal to put the Broncos up 17-0. In the third quarter Seattle tried to cut the lead when QB Matt Hasselbeck completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Ben Obomanu, but Denver scored with RB Knowshon Moreno getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter Seattle fell further behind when Orton found WR Demaryius Thomas on a 21-yard TD pass. Seattle would make the final score of the game when Hasselbeck scrambled 20 yards to the endzone for a touchdown.

Answer:
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_12
proposed answer: To determine how many points Seattle trailed by at halftime, we need to subtract the total points scored by the Seahawks in the first half from the total points scored by the Broncos in the first half. The Broncos scored 17 points and the Seahawks scored 6 points. Therefore, the calculation is: 17 (Broncos' points) - 6 (Seahawks' points) = 11 points. This means Seattle trailed by 11 points at halftime.
