Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_88
proposed answer: To calculate the difference in percentage points between Southampton and Wokingham free school meals percentages, I need the specific percentages for both locations. Assuming Southampton has a free school meals percentage of X% and Wokingham has Y%, the difference in percentage points would be calculated as |X - Y|. This gives the absolute difference between the two percentages, which is what is typically meant by 'difference in percentage points'. Without the actual values, I cannot provide a numerical answer, but the method to calculate it is clear.

Answer:The difference in percentage points is |X - Y|, where X is the percentage for Southampton and Y is the percentage for Wokingham.
Extracted answer: The difference in percentage points is |X - Y|, where X is the percentage for Southampton and Y is the percentage for Wokingham.
