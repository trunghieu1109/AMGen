Question: Passage: Coming off their Thursday night home win over the Packers, the Cowboys flew to Ford Field for a Week 14 interconference duel with the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as Lions RB T.J. Duckett getting a 32-yard TD run, along with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 19-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the board with RB Marion Barber getting a 20-yard TD run.  Detroit would answer with Hanson kicking a 36-yard field goal, while RB Kevin Jones getting a 2-yard TD run.  The Cowboys ended the half with QB Tony Romo completing an 8-yard TD pass to Barber. In the third quarter, the Lions replied with Jones getting a 3-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas came back and took the lead with Barber getting a 1-yard TD run and Romo completing a 16-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten. With the win, the Cowboys improved to 12-1 and clinched the NFC East crown for the first time since 1998.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_43
proposed answer: In Subtask 1, the yardage of the first field goal kicked by Jason Hanson was identified as 19 yards. In Subtask 2, the yardage of the second field goal was identified as 36 yards. To find the total yards of all field goals kicked by Jason Hanson, I need to sum these two values: 19 + 36. Performing the addition gives me 55 yards as the total yardage of the field goals.
