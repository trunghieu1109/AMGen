Question: Passage: Old age pensions were raised by 300 francs per month to 1,700 francs for a single person and to 3,700 francs for a couple, while health insurance benefits were made more widely available to unemployed persons and part-time employees. Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7 million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.

proposed answer: To calculate the total number of months between May 1981 and December 1982 inclusive, we first identify the months involved. Starting from May 1981, we count each month up to and including December 1982. The months are: May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December of 1981 (which gives us 8 months), and then we add the months of 1982: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December (which gives us 12 months). Therefore, the total number of months is 8 (for 1981) + 12 (for 1982) = 20 months. Thus, the total number of months from May 1981 to December 1982 inclusive is 20.
