Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent upiF', content='To calculate the total number of months between May 1981 and December 1982 inclusive, we first identify the months involved. Starting from May 1981, we count each month up to and including December 1982. The months are: May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December of 1981 (which gives us 8 months), and then we add the months of 1982: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December (which gives us 12 months). Therefore, the total number of months is 8 (for 1981) + 12 (for 1982) = 20 months. Thus, the total number of months from May 1981 to December 1982 inclusive is 20.\n\nAnswer:20', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
