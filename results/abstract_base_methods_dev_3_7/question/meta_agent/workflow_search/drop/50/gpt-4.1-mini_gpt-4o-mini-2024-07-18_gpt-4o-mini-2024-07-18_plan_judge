Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_50
proposed answer: From Subtask 1, we extracted that 25.00% of the population is under the age of 18. From Subtask 2, we found that 12.90% of the population is 65 years of age or older. To compare these two percentages, 25.00% is greater than 12.90%. Therefore, the age group under the age of 18 is larger than the age group of 65 years of age or older.
