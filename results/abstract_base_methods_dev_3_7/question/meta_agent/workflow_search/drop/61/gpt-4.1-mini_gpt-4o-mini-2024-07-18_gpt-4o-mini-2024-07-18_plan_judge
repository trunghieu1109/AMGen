Question: Passage: Another factor in the revolt of 1381 was the conduct of the war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months. Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_61
proposed answer: To find the number of years before the revolt of 1381 that Charles V of France became more active in the conflict, we take the year he became more active, which is 1369, and subtract it from the year of the revolt, which is 1381. The calculation is 1381 - 1369 = 12. Therefore, Charles V became more active 12 years before the revolt of 1381.

Answer:Charles V of France became more active in the conflict 12 years before the revolt of 1381.
Extracted answer: Charles V of France became more active in the conflict 12 years before the revolt of 1381.
