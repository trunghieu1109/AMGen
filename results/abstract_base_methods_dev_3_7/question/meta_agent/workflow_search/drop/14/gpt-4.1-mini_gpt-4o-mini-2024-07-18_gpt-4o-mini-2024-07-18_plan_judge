proposed answer: To determine which racial groups made up between 0.5% and 2.5% of the population, we can refer to the racial makeup percentages provided in the passage. The groups listed with their respective percentages are: 76.21% White, 2.41% African American, 1.73% Native American, 0.67% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 15.20% from Race, and 3.71% from two or more races. We need to identify those that fall within the specified range of 0.5% to 2.5%. The groups that meet this criterion are: African American (2.41%), Native American (1.73%), and Asian (0.67%). Therefore, the final list of racial groups that individually make up between 0.5% and 2.5% of the population includes these three groups.
