Question: Passage: In the census of 2010, there were 66,135 people, 26,265 (2000 data) households, and 14,051 (2000 data) families residing in the city. The population density was 6,096.7 people per square mile (2,199.9/km²). There were 30,272 (2000 data) housing units at an average density of 2,790.6 per square mile (1,077.2/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 59.38% (52.31% Non-Hispanic) (7.07 White-Hispanic) White (U.S. Census), 24.19% African American (U.S. Census), 14.47% Hispanic (U.S. Census) or Latin (U.S. Census)) of any race, 8.24% from Race (United States Census), 5.74% from two or more races, 2.62% Asian (U.S. Census), 0.69%  Native American (U.S.Census), and 0.14% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census). There is a growing Guyana population in the area. The top ancestries self-identified by people on the census are Italian (13.6%), Guyanese (12.3%), Irish (12.1%), Puerto Rican (10.1%), German (8.7%), English (6.0%), Polish (5.4%), French (4.4%). These reflect historic and early 20th-century immigration, as well as that since the late 20th century.

To find the percentage of people who were not African American, I subtract this percentage from 100%. The calculation is as follows: 100% - 24.19% = 75.81%. This indicates that 75.81% of the population were not African American. The reasoning is sound and the calculation is accurate, confirming that the percentage of people who were not African American is indeed 75.81%. Therefore, the review confirms the accuracy and completeness of the initial calculation.\\n\\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WFZD:\\n75.81%\\n\\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 3: Aggregate any variant answers from previous reasoning steps to select the most consistent and accurate percentage of people not African American.\\n\\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
