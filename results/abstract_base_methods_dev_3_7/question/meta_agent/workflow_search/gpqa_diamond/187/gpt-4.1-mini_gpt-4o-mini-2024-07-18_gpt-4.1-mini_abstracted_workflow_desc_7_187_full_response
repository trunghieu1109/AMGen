The lattice parameter \\\'a\\\' is already given as 10 Å. The angles α, β, and γ are given as 30°, which we can convert to radians for calculations if necessary. However, for the interplanar distance formula, we can use the angles in degrees directly since the formula accommodates that. The necessary parameters for the calculation will include the lattice parameter and the angles, which are essential for determining the reciprocal lattice vectors and subsequently the interplanar distance.\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp:\\nLattice parameter a = 10 Å; angles α = 30°, β = 30°, γ = 30°.\\n\\n### Subtask 3: Calculate the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell using the lattice parameters (a and α) to facilitate the calculation of reciprocal lattice vectors. \\n\\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrGJ:\\nTo calculate the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell, we use the formula V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos(α)^2 - cos(β)^2 - cos(γ)^2 + 2 * cos(α) * cos(β) * cos(γ)). Given that α = β = γ = 30°, we can substitute these values into the formula. First, we calculate cos(30°) = √3/2. Then we find: V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 - (√3/2)^2 - (√3/2)^2 - (√3/2)^2 + 2 * (√3/2) * (√3/2) * (√3/2)). After simplification, we find that the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell is 250 Å³.\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrGJ:\\n250 Å³\\n\\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 4: Compute the reciprocal lattice parameters (a*, α*) from the direct lattice parameters, which are required to calculate the interplanar spacing for the (111) plane.\\n\\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
