Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

proposed answer: Based on the analysis from Subtask 3, the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor is derived to be E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/(L²)). This expression indicates that the electric field behaves as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor, due to the spherical symmetry and the shielding effect of the conductor. Among the provided options, the only one that matches this derived expression is option 4, which states E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/(L²)). Therefore, the correct choice is D.

proposed answer: The computed electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor is derived using Coulomb's law, resulting in the expression E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2). This expression matches exactly with choice 4 provided in the options. The other choices involve different distances and configurations that do not apply to the scenario outside the conductor, where the charge can be treated as concentrated at the center. Therefore, the correct choice is D, which corresponds to the derived formula.
