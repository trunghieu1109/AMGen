The coefficients are 0.5 for |\\uparrow\\rangle and sqrt(3)/2 for |\\downarrow\\rangle. To ensure normalization, we check that the sum of the squares of the coefficients equals 1. The normalization condition is satisfied since (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Therefore, the state vector is correctly represented as 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle.; answer - 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Pauli matrices are represented in the spin-up (|\\uparrow\\rangle) and spin-down (|\\downarrow\\rangle) basis as follows: The operator \\sigma_z is represented by the matrix \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, which corresponds to the eigenvalues +1 for |\\uparrow\\rangle and -1 for |\\downarrow\\rangle. The operator \\sigma_x is represented by the matrix \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, which swaps the states |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle. Therefore, the expectation values can be computed using these matrices.; answer - The matrix form of the operators \\sigma_z and \\sigma_x in the |\\uparrow\\rangle, |\\downarrow\\rangle basis is: \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩, we first need to express the state vector |ψ⟩ in matrix form. The state vector is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩, which corresponds to the column vector |ψ⟩ = (0.5, √3/2)ᵀ. The operator σ_z in matrix form is given by σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. The expectation value is computed as ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5, √3/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * (0.5, √3/2)ᵀ. Performing the multiplication yields: σ_z|ψ⟩ = [[1*0.5 + 0*√3/2], [0*0.5 - 1*√3/2]] = [[0.5], [-√3/2]]. Then, ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5, √3/2) * [[0.5], [-√3/2]] = 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ is -0.5.; answer - -0.5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩, we first need to express the state vector |ψ⟩ as |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √(3)/2|↓⟩. The operator σ_x in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis is represented by the matrix σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. We can represent |ψ⟩ in vector form as |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √(3)/2]. The expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩† σ_x |ψ⟩. First, we compute σ_x |ψ⟩: σ_x |ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √(3)/2] = [√(3)/2, 0.5]. Next, we find ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √(3)/2] * [√(3)/2, 0.5] = 0.5 * (√(3)/2) + (√(3)/2) * 0.5 = (√(3)/2) = 0.86602540378, which rounds to 0.9 up to one decimal place. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is approximately 0.9.; answer - 0.9\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the total expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we need to combine the expectation values calculated in the previous subtasks. From subtask 3, we found ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = -0.5, and from subtask 4, we found ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ ≈ 0.9. We multiply the expectation value of σ_z by 10 and the expectation value of σ_x by 5. Thus, the total expectation value is calculated as follows: Total expectation value = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (0.9) = -5 + 4.5 = -0.5. Therefore, the total expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x is -0.5.; answer - -0.5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The computed expectation value from subtask 5 is -0.5.
