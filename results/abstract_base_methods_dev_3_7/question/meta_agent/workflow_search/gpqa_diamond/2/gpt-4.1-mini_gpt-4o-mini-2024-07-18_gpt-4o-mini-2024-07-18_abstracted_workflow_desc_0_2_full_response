In this basis, |↑⟩ corresponds to the vector (1, 0) and |↓⟩ corresponds to (0, 1). Therefore, the state |ψ⟩ can be represented as a column vector: |ψ⟩ = 0.5(1, 0) + (√3)/2(0, 1) = (0.5, √3/2).

The state is given as |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩, which corresponds to the vector (0.5, √3/2) in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The operator σ_z in matrix form is represented as σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. We can calculate ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ as follows: First, we find σ_z|ψ⟩ = σ_z(0.5, √3/2) = (0.5, -√3/2). Then, we compute ⟨ψ| = (0.5, √3/2)† (the conjugate transpose), leading to ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5, √3/2) * (0.5, -√3/2). This results in 0.5 * 0.5 + √3/2 * (-√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = -0.5. However, we need to combine this with the expectation value of σ_x to find ⟨ψ|10σ_z + 5σ_x|ψ⟩, where σ_x is represented as [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. The expectation value of σ_x can be calculated similarly, leading to a total expectation value of 1.65 when both contributions are included.

We can compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ by performing the following steps: First, calculate σ_x|ψ⟩, which yields the result of applying the matrix to the vector. Then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|.
