The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s. Therefore, we calculate ΔE as follows: ΔE ≈ (1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s) / (2 * 10^-9 s) = (1.0545718 x 10^-34) / (2 x 10^-9) = 5.272859 x 10^-26 J. To convert this to electron volts (eV), we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Thus, ΔE in eV is approximately (5.272859 x 10^-26 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.29 x 10^-7 eV.
