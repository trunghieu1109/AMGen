Since there are 2 possible values for each spin and there are 3 spins, the total number of configurations is 2^3 = 8. The configurations can be listed as follows: (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, -1, 1), (1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1), (-1, -1, -1).

We will substitute the values of S1, S2, and S3 from each configuration into this formula. Each configuration has three spins that can take values +1 or -1, and we will compute the products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 for each configuration. Then we will sum these products and multiply by -J to find the energy for each configuration.; answer - The energies for the configurations are as follows:\n1. (1, 1, 1): E = -J(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = -3J\n2. (1, 1, -1): E = -J(1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = J\n3. (1, -1, 1): E = -J(1*(-1) + 1*1 + (-1)*1) = J\n4.
