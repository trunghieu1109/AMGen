Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n', choice1='(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028', choice2='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)', choice3='(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n', choice4='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The normalized eigenvector obtained is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). When comparing this with the provided multiple-choice options, we see that choice 3 matches exactly with the normalized eigenvector. The other choices do not represent the same components as the eigenvector we derived, as they either include additional factors or different functional forms. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the normalized eigenvector is choice 3.
