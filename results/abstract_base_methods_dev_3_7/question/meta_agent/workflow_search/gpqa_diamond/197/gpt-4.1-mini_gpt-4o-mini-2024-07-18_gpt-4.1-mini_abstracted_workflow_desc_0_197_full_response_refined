The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 10^-2 M, which is reflected in the mass balance equation. The total thiocyanate mass balance also accurately includes the initial concentration of SCN- and the ligands used in forming the complexes, ensuring that the balance is maintained. The equilibrium expressions are formulated based on the stability constants provided, which relate the concentrations of the complexes to the free Co(II) and SCN- concentrations.

By solving the simultaneous equations, we can find the concentrations of each complex, particularly [Co(SCN)2^0], which represents the dithiocyanato complex. Once we have this concentration, we can calculate the total concentration of cobalt species and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.

The fraction of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2^0], was found to be 25.6% of the total cobalt concentration. This means that if we calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and the other complexes, their sum should equal the total cobalt concentration. If the calculations are consistent and the fractions add up to 1 (or 100%), then the results are verified. Since the previous calculations indicated that the dithiocyanato complex is indeed 25.6% of the total, we can confirm that this is correct and consistent with the mass balance and equilibrium expressions used in Sub-task 3.\\n\\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pXa2:\\n25.6%\\n\\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Please review the fraction calculations for the dithiocyanato complex and the sum of all species fractions, providing feedback on any inconsistencies or errors.\\n\\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
