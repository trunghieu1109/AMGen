The total cobalt concentration is accurately expressed as the sum of free Co(II) and all complexed species concentrations. The equilibrium expressions derived from the stability constants correctly represent the formation of each complex from the previous one, and they are consistent with the mass balance equation. This systematic approach ensures that all cobalt species are accounted for in the solution, confirming the relationships among the species and the validity of the expressions.\\n\\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent sGP6:\\nThe mass balance and equilibrium expressions are correct and consistent.\\n\\n### Subtask 3: Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt species (free Co(II), mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrathiocyanato complexes) using the mass balance and stability constants, considering the initial concentrations c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, based on Subtask 2 output. \\n\\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Sl5S:\\nTo calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt species, we start with the mass balance of cobalt, which states that the total concentration of cobalt must equal the sum of the free Co(II) ions and the concentrations of all the complexes formed with thiocyanate. We denote the concentrations of the free Co(II) as [Co], the monothiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)], the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)2], the trithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)3], and the tetrathiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)4]. The stability constants provided allow us to set up equilibrium expressions for each step of complex formation. By applying these constants and the initial concentrations, we can derive the equilibrium concentrations of each species. After performing the calculations, we find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species, which is determined by the ratio of the concentration of [Co(SCN)2] to the total cobalt concentration. This systematic approach ensures that all cobalt species are accounted for and allows us to arrive at the final percentage.
