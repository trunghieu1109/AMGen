Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8', content='To calculate the fraction α2 for the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex [Co(SCN)2], we use the formula α2 = [Co(SCN)2]/C_total = (β2 * [L]^2) / D. Given β2 = 40, [L] = 0.1 M, and D = 2.3646, we can substitute these values into the equation. First, we calculate β2 * [L]^2: 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. Now, we can find α2: α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1690. To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: 100 * α2 = 100 * 0.1690 = 16.9%.

Now, we can find α2: α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1690. To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: 100 * α2 = 100 * 0.1690 = 16.9%.
