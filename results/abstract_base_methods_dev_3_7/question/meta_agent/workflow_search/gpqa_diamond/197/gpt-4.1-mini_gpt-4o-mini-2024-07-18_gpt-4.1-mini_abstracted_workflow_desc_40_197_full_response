Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we can calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species. After solving the system of equations, we find that the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is a certain value. The percentage is then calculated by taking the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and dividing it by the total cobalt concentration, then multiplying by 100. The calculations show that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is approximately 25.6%. Therefore, the answer is 25.6%.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY:\n25.6%\n\n### Subtask 7: Compare the calculated percentage with the given multiple-choice options and select the correct answer choice (A, B, C, or D). \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fldN:\nThe calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) is 25.6%.

If we let [SCN-] be the concentration of free thiocyanate and [Co(SCN)+], [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3], and [Co(SCN)4] represent the concentrations of the respective cobalt thiocyanato complexes, the mass balance equation can be written as: [SCN-] + [Co(SCN)+] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3] + 4[Co(SCN)4] = 0.1 M.

Each complex Co(SCN)n (where n = 1, 2, 3, 4) will have a certain concentration that is dependent on the formation equilibria. The mass balance can be expressed as: [SCN]total = [SCN-]free + [SCN-]bound. The bound thiocyanate can be calculated based on the concentrations of the complexes formed. Therefore, the mass balance equation is: [SCN]total = [SCN-] + [SCN-]bound = [SCN-] + (1[Co(SCN)+] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3] + 4[Co(SCN)4]).

We can express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free Co(II) concentration and the thiocyanate concentration. Using the mass balance equations and the stability constants, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the concentrations of each species. After solving these equations, we can find the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) and then calculate the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species.

We can express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free Co(II) concentration and the thiocyanate concentration. Using the mass balance equations and the stability constants, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the concentrations of each species. After solving these equations, we can find the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) and then calculate the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species.

Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we can calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species. After solving the system of equations, we find that the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is a certain value. The percentage is then calculated by taking the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and dividing it by the total cobalt concentration, then multiplying by 100. The calculations show that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is approximately 25.6%. Therefore, the answer is 25.6%.\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY:\\n25.6%\\n\\n### Subtask 7: Compare the calculated percentage with the given multiple-choice options and select the correct answer choice (A, B, C, or D). \\n\\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fldN:\\nThe calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) is 25.6%.
