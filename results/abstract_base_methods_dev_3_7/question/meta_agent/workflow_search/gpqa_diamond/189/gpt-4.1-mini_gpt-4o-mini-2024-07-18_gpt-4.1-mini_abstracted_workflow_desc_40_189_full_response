Hydroxide (OH-) is the strongest nucleophile due to its negative charge and high electronegativity. Ethanethiolate (C2H5S-) is also a strong nucleophile with a negative charge but is less electronegative than hydroxide, making it the second most reactive. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate has a negative charge but lacks resonance stabilization, placing it third. Propionate, while having resonance stabilization, is less reactive than the previously mentioned nucleophiles due to its structure. Methanol is neutral and has the least nucleophilicity. Therefore, the final ranking from most reactive to least reactive is: hydroxide (2), ethanethiolate (5), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), propionate (3), and methanol (4).
