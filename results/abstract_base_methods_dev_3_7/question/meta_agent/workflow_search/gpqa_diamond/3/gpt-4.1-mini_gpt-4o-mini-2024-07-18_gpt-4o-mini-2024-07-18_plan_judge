proposed answer: In the context of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are modified to account for the existence of isolated magnetic charges. The divergence of the magnetic field, represented by ∇ · B, changes from being zero to being proportional to the magnetic charge density, thus indicating that there are magnetic monopoles present. Furthermore, the equations involving the curl of the magnetic field may also be affected to include terms related to magnetic currents. Therefore, both the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the curl of the magnetic field are altered, which corresponds to choice 2. This reflects the fundamental changes in electromagnetic theory when considering magnetic monopoles, making choice 2 the correct answer.

proposed answer: The modified Maxwell's equations due to the presence of magnetic monopoles include changes to the divergence of the magnetic field (B) and the curl of the electric field (E). The divergence of B is modified to account for magnetic charge density, while the curl of E is modified to include a term for magnetic current density. Therefore, the correct choice that encompasses both changes is the one that mentions both the divergence of the magnetic field and the curl of the electric field. Among the provided options, choice 2 states 'The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field', which accurately reflects the changes in both equations. Hence, the answer is choice B).
