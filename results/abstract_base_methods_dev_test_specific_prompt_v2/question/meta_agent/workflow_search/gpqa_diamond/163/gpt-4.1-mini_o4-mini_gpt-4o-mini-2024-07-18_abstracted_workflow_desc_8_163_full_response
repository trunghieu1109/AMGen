Hence M1/M2 = K2/K1. In system_1, K1=10\u2009km/s and K2=5\u2009km/s, so M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5.

We get a sin i from the RV amplitudes: a sin i = (K1+K2)·P/(2π). For system 1: (K1+K2)_1 = 10+5 =15 km/s and P1 =2 yr, so a1 ∝15·2. For system 2: (K1+K2)_2 =15+10 =25 km/s and P2 =1 yr, so a2 ∝25·1. Thus a1/a2 = (15·2)/(25·1) =30/25 =1.2.

However, it has several limitations: (1) The inclination i of each system is unknown—while it cancels in the ratio if both binaries share the same i, any difference alters the result. (2) Eccentricity has been neglected; non-circular orbits change the relation between RV amplitudes and semimajor axis. (3) Unit conversions (P in years, K in km/s) require consistent constants—our proportional approach assumes ideal scaling. (4) We assume the observed RV amplitudes fully sample the orbit and that there are no systematic errors in K measurements. These approximations mean the factor ≈0.4 is an estimate rather than an exact value.; answer: ~ 0.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent wJxV, refining total masses, thinking: To find the total mass ratio M₁/M₂ we use Kepler’s third law: M∝a³/P².
