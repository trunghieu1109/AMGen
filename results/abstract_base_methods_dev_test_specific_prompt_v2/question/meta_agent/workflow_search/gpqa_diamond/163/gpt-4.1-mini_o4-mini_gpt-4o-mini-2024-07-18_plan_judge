Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We calculate the mass ratio using Kepler’s third law: M₁/M₂ = (a₁/a₂)³·(P₂/P₁)². Given a₁/a₂ = 15/10 ÷ (10/5) = 1.2 and P₂/P₁ = 1/2, we get M₁/M₂ = 1.2³·(1/2)² = 1.728·0.25 ≈ 0.432. Of the provided choices (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), 0.432 is closest to 0.4, corresponding to option A).
