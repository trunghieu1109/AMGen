Question: Example(question='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n', choice1='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.', choice2='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.', choice3='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.', choice4='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Mott–Gurney equation J=(9/8)εμV²/L³ is derived under space‐charge‐limited current conditions assuming: 1) a trap‐free semiconductor so no carriers are immobilized, 2) transport is dominated by one type of carrier (single‐carrier), 3) injection is barrier‐free (Ohmic contacts) so that drift injection fills the device, and 4) diffusion current is negligible compared to drift. Choice A states exactly these conditions (“trap‐free single‐carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current”), matching all derivation assumptions. The other options violate one or more requirements (negligible drift, two carriers, or Schottky barrier), so A) is correct.
