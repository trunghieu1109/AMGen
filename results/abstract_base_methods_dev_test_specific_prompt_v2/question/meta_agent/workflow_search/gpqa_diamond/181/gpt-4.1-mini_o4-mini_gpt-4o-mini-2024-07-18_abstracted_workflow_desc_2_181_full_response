Choice A matches all these requirements. Choices B and D introduce incorrect contact or current assumptions, and choice C involves two carriers instead of one. Thus, A) is correct.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent BV9n:\nLet’s review each option against the known validity conditions for the Mott–Gurney law (J=(9/8)εμV²/L³) in the space‐charge‐limited regime: 1. The layer must be trap‐free (so no carriers are immobilized). 2. Only one type of carrier should dominate (single‐carrier). 3. Contacts must be Ohmic (no injection barrier), so drift injection dominates. 4. Diffusion current must be negligible compared to drift. \n\nChoice A states “trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.” That exactly matches all four requirements. Choice B wrongly says “negligible drift current,” but drift must dominate. Choice C involves two carriers, violating single‐carrier assumption. Choice D uses a Schottky contact (injection barrier), which invalidates barrier‐free injection. Thus, only choice A meets all criteria.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent m9gy:\nWe examine each choice against the criteria for the Mott–Gurney law: a trap‐free, single‐carrier layer with barrier‐free (Ohmic) contacts so that drift current dominates and diffusion current is negligible.\n\nChoice A states exactly “trap‐free single‐carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.” This matches the known validity conditions.\n\nChoice B incorrectly requires negligible drift current, but the law assumes drift‐limited transport, not diffusion‐limited.\n\nChoice C introduces two carriers, whereas the equation applies only when a single type of charge carrier dominates (no bipolar injection).\n\nChoice D uses a Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier and violates the barrier‐free requirement for Ohmic contacts.\n\nTherefore, Choice A is the only one that fulfills all necessary conditions.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent FCOc:\nThe Mott–Gurney law J = (9/8)εμV²/L³ is derived assuming a trap-free, single‐carrier layer where the contacts are Ohmic (barrier‐free) so that injection is not limited by the contact but by space‐charge, and drift current dominates over diffusion.

Choice B wrongly suggests negligible drift (but drift must dominate). Choice C introduces two carriers (invalidates single‐carrier assumption).
