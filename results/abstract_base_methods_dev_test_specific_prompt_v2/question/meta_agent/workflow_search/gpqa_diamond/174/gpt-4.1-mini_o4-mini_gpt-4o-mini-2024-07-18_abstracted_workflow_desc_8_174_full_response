Its far‐field intensity follows ∝sin^2θ\u2009cos^2θ, producing four lobes with zeros at θ=0° and 90°, and peaking at θ=45° with value 1/4. At θ=30°, the intensity is sin^2(30°)\u2009cos^2(30°) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16, which relative to the maximum 1/4 gives a fraction of (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4. Quadrupole radiation power scales as ω^6 ⇒ λ⁻⁶. Thus the correct choice is the one giving 3/4 and λ⁻⁶.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ExAm, validating multipole order, thinking: The spheroidal breathing mode is perfectly axisymmetric and carries no net dipole moment, so dipole (ℓ=1) radiation is forbidden. Monopole (ℓ=0) radiation does not exist for electromagnetic fields. The leading nonzero term is therefore the electric quadrupole (ℓ=2), which naturally produces the sin^2θ\u2009cos^2θ angular pattern and a λ⁻⁶ frequency dependence. This matches both the symmetry constraints and the calculated angular distribution and wavelength scaling, confirming that quadrupole radiation is the correct mechanism.; answer: Electric quadrupole (ℓ=2) radiation is validated\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent AVqY, providing feedback, thinking: The validation correctly recognizes that an axisymmetric “breathing” spheroid has no net monopole or dipole terms, making the electric quadrupole (ℓ=2) the first nonzero EM emitter. However, it rests on key assumptions—perfect spheroidal symmetry, the long‐wavelength limit (object size ≪ λ), and neglect of magnetic quadrupole or higher multipoles—and ignores near‐field or relativistic corrections.; answer: Electric quadrupole radiation is indeed the leading term under ideal symmetry, but its applicability is limited by departures from perfect spheroidal shape, the emergence of higher multipoles at shorter wavelengths (when size ∼λ), magnetic contributions, and breakdown of the strict λ⁻⁶ scaling outside the long‐wavelength regime.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ExAm, refining validation, thinking: The axisymmetric spheroidal breathing mode has no net monopole or dipole moment, so the leading nonzero electromagnetic radiation term must be the electric quadrupole (ℓ=2).

This arises from the ℓ=2 spherical harmonic Y₂⁰(θ,ϕ) ∝ (3\u2009cos²θ−1), whose radiation pattern squared yields zeros at θ=0° and 90°, a maximum at θ=45°, and the characteristic sin²θ\u2009cos²θ form.

From subtask 2, the angular dependence is f(θ)∝sin²θ\u2009cos²θ. Combining multiplicatively gives the full radiated power per unit solid angle f(λ,θ)=C·λ⁻⁶\u2009sin²θ\u2009cos²θ, where C is a normalization constant.

Thus it omits any overall normalization constant and cannot predict absolute power. It also presumes the charge distribution is much smaller than the wavelength (λ≫source size), so that retardation across the source is negligible. Near‐field terms, dipole or higher multipole contributions, polarization details, and any effects of a surrounding medium are all neglected. Consequently, the formula is valid only in the asymptotic radiation zone under the quadrupole approximation and for free‐space propagation.; answer: Valid solely in the far‐field (r≫λ) under the quadrupole approximation, neglecting normalization, near‐field effects, other multipoles, polarization, and medium influences; and requiring the source size to be ≪ λ.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Ysjc, refining combined functional form, thinking: We’ve identified that the dominant radiation arises from the electric quadrupole moment, which yields a wavelength dependence f(λ)∝λ⁻⁶, and from sub‐task 2 we found an angular dependence f(θ)∝sin²θ\u2009cos²θ.
