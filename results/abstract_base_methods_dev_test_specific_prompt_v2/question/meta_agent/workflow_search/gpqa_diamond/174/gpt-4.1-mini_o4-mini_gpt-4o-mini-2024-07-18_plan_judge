Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: For an oscillating spheroidal charge in the far-field the radiation pattern follows a dipole-like angular dependence f(θ)∝sin²θ and scales with wavelength as λ⁻⁴. The maximum occurs at θ=90° where sin²90°=1. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4, so only one quarter of the peak power A is emitted in that direction. Comparing the given options, only “1/4, λ⁻⁴” matches, which corresponds to choice C).

proposed answer: From the radiation pattern f(λ,θ)∝λ⁻⁶ sin²θ cos²θ, the angular factor sin²θ cos²θ is maximal at θ=45° with value 1/4, so A∝λ⁻⁶·(1/4). At θ=30°, sin²30°·cos²30°=(1/4)·(3/4)=3/16, giving f(30°)∝λ⁻⁶·(3/16). The fraction of the maximum is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4, and the wavelength dependence remains λ⁻⁶. Among the given options only choice2 matches 3/4 and λ⁻⁶, which corresponds to option B).
