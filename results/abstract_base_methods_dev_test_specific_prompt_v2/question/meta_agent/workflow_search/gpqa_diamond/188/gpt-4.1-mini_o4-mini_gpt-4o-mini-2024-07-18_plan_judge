Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are all Goldstone modes resulting from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries: spin-rotation for magnons, chiral symmetry for pions, and translational symmetry for phonons. Skyrmions, in contrast, are topological solitons whose stability is due to nontrivial field topology rather than arising from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. Therefore, the particle not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking is the skyrmion.
