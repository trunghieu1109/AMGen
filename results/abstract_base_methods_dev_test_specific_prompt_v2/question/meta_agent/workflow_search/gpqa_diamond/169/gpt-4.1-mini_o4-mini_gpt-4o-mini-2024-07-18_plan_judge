Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We normalize the spinor (3i,4): its norm is √(|3i|²+|4|²)=5, so |ψ⟩=(3i/5,4/5). The Pauli matrix σ_y = [[0,−i],[i,0]]. Acting on |ψ⟩ gives σ_y|ψ⟩ = (0·3i/5 + (−i)·4/5, i·3i/5 + 0·4/5) = (−4i/5,−3/5). The expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = (3i/5)* (−4i/5) + (4/5)*(−3/5) = ((−3i)(−4i)/25) + (−12/25) = (−3×−4×i²)/25 −12/25 = (−3×−4×(−1))/25 −12/25 = −12/25 −12/25 = −24/25. Then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(−24/25) = −12ħ/25. This matches choice B).
