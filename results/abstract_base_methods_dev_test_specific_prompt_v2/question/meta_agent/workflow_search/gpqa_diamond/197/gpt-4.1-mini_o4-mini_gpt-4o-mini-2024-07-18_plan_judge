Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_197
proposed answer: The calculated concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)₂] = 1.69×10⁻³ M. Dividing by the total Co concentration (1.00×10⁻² M) and multiplying by 100% gives (1.69×10⁻³/1.00×10⁻²)×100% = 16.9%. This exactly matches choice A).
