Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and acid converts the C-1 ketone into the corresponding tosyl hydrazone, without touching the ether or the alkene.

Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic conditions converts the ketone to a tosylhydrazone: the C=O is replaced by a C=N–NH–Ts linkage, with loss of water.

Under Shapiro conditions (2 equiv n-BuLi, low temperature, then quench), the hydrazone undergoes deprotonation at N–NH–Ts, elimination of TsNHLi and N₂ loss to give a vinyl anion at C-1. Protonation on workup yields a C1–C2 double bond. All other substituents (the benzyl ether at C-3 and the isopropenyl at C-5) remain intact. Thus product 3 is the cyclohexene where the former ketone carbon (C-1) is now part of a C1=C2 alkene:; answer: 3-((Benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 4RBZ, feedback round 0, thinking: The proposed structure 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene is chemically plausible as the Shapiro reaction product of the tosylhydrazone: deprotonation, loss of N₂ and TsNHLi, then protonation yields the alkene at C1–C2 while retaining the benzyl ether and isopropenyl substituents. However, this overlooks several practical limitations of the Shapiro protocol.; answer: Limitations of the Shapiro reaction include: 1) Strong bases (n-BuLi) can deprotonate or cleave sensitive functional groups (e.g. benzyl ethers) or induce side eliminations (e.g. formation of conjugated dienes with the isopropenyl moiety). 2) It often gives mixtures of E/Z alkene isomers with little stereocontrol. 3) Competing deprotonation at other acidic sites can reduce yield. 4) Requires an excess of strong base and low temperature, limiting functional‐group tolerance.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent gkkC, refining Shapiro reaction product, thinking: Under Shapiro conditions (treatment of a tosylhydrazone with two equivalents of n-BuLi at low temperature followed by aqueous workup), the hydrazone is deprotonated on nitrogen, then expels p-toluenesulfonamide and N₂ to generate a vinyl anion at the former carbonyl carbon. Protonation of that anion on workup yields a new C1=C2 double bond. The benzyl ether at C3 and the existing isopropenyl (prop-1-en-2-yl) group at C5 are untouched.

Under Pd/C hydrogenation, the alkene in the ring and the exocyclic isopropenyl both become saturated, giving isopropyl. The benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, regenerating the primary alcohol.

Hydrogenation with Pd/C reduces both the ring alkene and the isopropenyl to yield a fully saturated cyclohexane bearing an isopropyl at C5.

In addition, Pd/C hydrogenolysis removes the benzyl ether protecting group at C3, regenerating the free hydroxymethyl (CH2OH).
