Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_48_190
proposed answer: Catalytic hydrogenation of product 3 over Pd/C removes the benzyl protecting group by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the free CH2OH and reduces the exocyclic prop-1-en-2-yl double bond to an isopropyl substituent without altering the cyclohexane ring. The result is a cyclohexane bearing a hydroxymethyl at C1 and an isopropyl at C3, which corresponds exactly to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. No other choice matches this structure.
