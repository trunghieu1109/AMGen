Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_187
proposed answer: The calculated interplanar spacing d₁₁₁ for this rhombohedral cell with a=10 Å and α=β=γ=30° comes out to be very close to 9 Å. Among the provided choices (9.54, 8.95, 9.08, and 10.05 Å), the value 9.08 Å matches our computed result most closely. Therefore, the correct selection is C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_187
proposed answer: The computed interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral lattice is approximately 9.532 Å, which rounds to 9.54 Å. Among the provided options, only choice A matches this value exactly. Therefore, the correct selection is A).
