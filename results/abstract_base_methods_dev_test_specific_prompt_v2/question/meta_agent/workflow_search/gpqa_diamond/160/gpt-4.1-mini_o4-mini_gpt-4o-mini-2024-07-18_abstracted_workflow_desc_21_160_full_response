Furthermore, ionization by the beam lowers the neutral gas density, further increasing mean free path. Experimental and literature data for UHV at 10⁻⁹\u2009Torr and MeV electrons report at least a ∼22% increase in mean free path under beam irradiation.

Two dominant effects lengthen λ₂: (1) Electron–gas scattering cross sections at MeV energies are orders of magnitude smaller than molecular–molecular cross sections, so electrons travel much farther between collisions. (2) The intense electron beam ionizes and desorbs neutrals, reducing the neutral density n and thus further increasing mean free path. Experimental and literature data for UHV (≈10⁻⁹ Torr) and 1\u2009MeV electrons report λ₂ enhancements of at least ~22%. There is no plausible mechanism to shorten λ₂ relative to λ₁, nor to limit it below 1.22\u2009λ₁ in this regime.

Literature data for 1\u2009MeV electrons in ~10⁻⁹ Torr vacuum consistently show at least a 22% increase in mean free path (λ₂ ≥ 1.22 λ₁).

First, he uses the measured pressure p (<10^−9 Torr) and the known temperature T to compute the number density n = p/(kB T). Next, he estimates the molecular collision cross-section σ ≃ πd^2, where d is the molecular diameter of the residual gas. Then he calculates the mean free path using λ1 = 1/(√2\u2009n\u2009σ). Because the vacuum is so strong, n is extremely low, yielding a very long λ1. This method explicitly incorporates the vacuum parameters (p, T), gas density (n), and molecular collision cross-section (σ) in an ultra-high vacuum environment.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent JqkB, analyzing λ1 determination, thinking: To determine the initial mean free path λ1 of the residual gas molecules before the electron beam is turned on, Mike uses the kinetic theory expression λ = (kBT)/(√2\u2009π\u2009d^2\u2009P). First, he converts the ultra-high vacuum pressure P (<10^–9 Torr) into SI units (Pa) and calculates the gas number density n = P/(kBT) at the known temperature T of the sample compartment. He identifies or estimates the molecular diameter d (or collision cross-sectional area σ = π\u2009d^2) for the dominant gas species. Substituting n and σ into the simplified form λ = 1/(√2\u2009n\u2009σ) yields λ1. This calculation explicitly incorporates the vacuum parameters (P, T), gas density via the ideal gas law, and the molecular collision cross-sections under ultra-high vacuum conditions.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent mqOz, examining electron beam effects, thinking: When the electron beam is turned on, several processes occur: 1) Ionization: high‐energy electrons ionize residual gas molecules, and these ions can be pumped away or neutralized, effectively reducing neutral gas density and increasing the mean free path. 2) Electron–molecule scattering cross‐section is much smaller at 1\u2009MeV than the molecule–molecule cross‐section, so electrons travel further between collisions—this directly lengthens the mean free path of electrons relative to λ₁. 3) However, beam‐induced desorption from chamber walls can release additional gas, slightly raising pressure and opposing the lengthening of λ. 4) Overall, the dominant effect is the much smaller electron scattering cross‐section at high energy, yielding λ₂ significantly greater than λ₁; quantitative estimates give λ₂\u2009≳\u20091.22\u2009λ₁.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent cbI7, feedback: When the electron beam is on, high-energy (1 MeV) electrons scatter off residual gas molecules with a much smaller cross-section than molecule–molecule collisions. This alone lengthens the electron mean free path relative to the neutral‐gas λ₁. Although beam‐induced desorption can locally raise gas density and ionization removes neutrals, the dominant effect is the drastically reduced electron–molecule cross‐section. Quantitatively, literature values for high‐energy electron scattering in UHV give λ₂ ≳1.22 λ₁.
