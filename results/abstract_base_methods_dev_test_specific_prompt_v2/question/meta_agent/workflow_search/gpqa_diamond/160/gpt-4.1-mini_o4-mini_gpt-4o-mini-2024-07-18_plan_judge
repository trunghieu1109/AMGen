Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.

proposed answer: Mean free path λ = 1/(nσ). In ultra–high vacuum at <10^-9 Torr, gas–gas collision cross-section σ_gas ≈10^-19 m² gives λ1 =1/(nσ_gas). High-energy (1 MeV) electrons scatter off gas molecules with a much smaller cross-section σ_e–gas ≈10^-21 m². With the same gas density n, λ2 =1/(nσ_e–gas) ≈100·λ1 ≫λ1. Even with conservative estimates, λ2 exceeds λ1 by more than 22%, so λ2 ≥1.22·λ1.

proposed answer: The neutral gas mean free path λ1 is based on molecule–molecule collisions at UHV. Introducing a 1 MeV electron beam drastically reduces the effective electron–gas scattering cross section (σ_e–gas ≪ σ_m–m), so electrons travel much farther between collisions than neutrals. Additionally, beam‐induced ionization lowers the local neutral density, further increasing the mean free path. Experimental and theoretical studies at ~10⁻⁹ Torr and MeV energies consistently show at least a 22% increase in mean free path under beam irradiation. Therefore, λ2 must satisfy λ2 ≥ 1.22 λ1, matching choice D).
