However, it assumes X is exactly skew‐Hermitian and that the exponential series is computed without error. In numerical or approximate settings, truncation of the Taylor series, floating-point round-off, or small departures from true skew‐Hermiticity can break unitarity. For unbounded operators in infinite dimensions, domain issues may also prevent e^X from being well defined or unitary on the whole space.; answer: While e^X is theoretically unitary when X†=–X, in practice one must account for numerical approximation errors, series truncation, and ensure X is exactly skew-Hermitian to maintain unitarity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Fv94, refining unitarity verification of e^X, thinking: Since we showed X†=–X, X is skew-Hermitian.
