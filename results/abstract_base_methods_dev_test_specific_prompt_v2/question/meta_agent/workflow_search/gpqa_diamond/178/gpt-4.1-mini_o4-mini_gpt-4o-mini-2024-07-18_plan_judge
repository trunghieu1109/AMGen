Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_178
proposed answer: W is unitary but X is neither Hermitian nor skew‐Hermitian, so e^X is not unitary. Therefore there must exist some vector whose norm changes under multiplication by e^X. Conjugating Y by nonunitary e^X fails to preserve Hermiticity, so (e^X)Y(e^{-X}) is not a valid quantum state. Although Z is Hermitian and thus an observable, X is not Hermitian and thus not an observable. Hence the only correct statement is B.

proposed answer: We check each statement: A) W is unitary but X is skew-Hermitian (not unitary), so A is false. B) Since X is skew-Hermitian, e^X is unitary and preserves all vector norms, so B is false. D) Z is Hermitian but X is not, so D is false. C) Y is a valid density matrix and conjugation by the unitary U=e^X yields UYU† which remains Hermitian, positive semidefinite with trace one, hence a valid quantum state. Thus only C is correct.
