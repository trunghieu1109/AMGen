Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_158
proposed answer: Numerical integration for a flat ΛCDM universe (H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) at z≈5.5 gives a comoving distance D_C≈7.3 Gpc. Comparing to the options: 6 Gpc is ∼1.3 Gpc too low, 8 Gpc is ∼0.7 Gpc too high, and 9 Gpc is ∼1.7 Gpc too high. The 7 Gpc choice deviates by only ∼0.3 Gpc, making it the closest match.

proposed answer: The Lambda–CDM integral gave ~11.8 Gpc. Comparing to the discrete options: |11.8−6|=5.8, |11.8−7|=4.8, |11.8−8|=3.8, |11.8−9|=2.8 Gpc. The smallest difference is with 9 Gpc, so the closest provided choice is 9 Gpc.
