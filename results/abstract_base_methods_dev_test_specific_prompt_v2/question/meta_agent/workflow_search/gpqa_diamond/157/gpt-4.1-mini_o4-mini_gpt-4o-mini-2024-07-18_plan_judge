Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_157
proposed answer: In a dominant-negative mutation affecting the dimerization domain, the mutant subunit still binds the wild-type subunit but the resulting heterodimers are nonfunctional. These defective complexes often misfold or aggregate, sequestering the wild-type protein and abolishing its activity even in heterozygotes. This classic dominant-negative mechanism best matches the phenotype “protein aggregation and loss-of-function.”
