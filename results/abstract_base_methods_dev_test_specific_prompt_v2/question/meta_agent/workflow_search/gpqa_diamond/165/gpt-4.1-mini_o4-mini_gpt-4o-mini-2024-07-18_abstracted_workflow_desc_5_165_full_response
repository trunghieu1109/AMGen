When both φ and h acquire VEVs x and v, this U(1) is spontaneously broken, yielding one massless Goldstone which would reside in the orthogonal combination of their phase directions. However, gauge and explicit terms give mass to one orthogonal CP–odd scalar (the usual eaten Goldstone for Z) and the remaining orthogonal CP–even direction remains approximately massless at tree level—this is the pseudo–Goldstone. In the CP–even basis one diagonalizes the mass matrix of the real parts of φ and h, obtaining two mass eigenstates: H₁ (mostly Higgs) and H₂ (mostly singlet). H₂ is the pseudo–Goldstone arising from the nearly broken global symmetry.; answer: H₂ is the mostly–singlet CP–even scalar, i.e. the orthogonal combination of the real parts of φ and h (H₂=cosα\u2009Re\u2009φ−sinα\u2009Re\u2009h), which acquires its small mass radiatively as the pseudo–Goldstone boson.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent UV2z, analyzed symmetry breaking and identified H_2, thinking: The scalar potential has an enlarged global U(1) symmetry acting on the phases of φ and the neutral component of h. Both φ and h acquire VEVs x and v, so their phase excitations mix. One linear combination of the phases is eaten by the Z (the usual would-be Goldstone), while the orthogonal combination remains in the spectrum and is a pseudo-Goldstone once explicit loop effects generate its mass. Concretely, if we write φ=(x+ρ) e^{iηφ/x}/√2 and h^0=(v+σ) e^{iηh/v}/√2, the massless tree-level mode is H2∝(v ηφ − x ηh)/√(x^2+v^2). This is the pseudo-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of the global phase symmetry.; answer: H2 is the orthogonal phase combination H2=(v\u2009Im\u2009φ−x\u2009Im\u2009h)/√(x^2+v^2), the pseudo-Goldstone boson of the broken global symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent TGZQ, reviewed radiative corrections, thinking: The one‐loop mass of a pseudo‐Goldstone scalar arises from the Coleman–Weinberg potential V₁= (1/64π²)Σ n_i M_i⁴(φ) [ln(M_i²/μ²)−c_i], with bosonic loops giving positive contributions and fermionic loops negative.
