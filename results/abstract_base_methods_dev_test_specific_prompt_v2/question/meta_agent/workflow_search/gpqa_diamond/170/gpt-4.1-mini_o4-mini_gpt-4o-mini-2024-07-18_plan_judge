Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_170
proposed answer: From Sub-task 4 the para‐isomer yield order is 4<2<6<3<1<5. Comparing to the options: 
A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 
B) 4<2<6<3<1<5 
C) 6<2<4<5<1<3 
D) 4<6<2<1<5<3 
Only choice B matches exactly. Therefore, the correct answer is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 4

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_170
proposed answer: We derived the ranking 4<6<2<1<5<3. Option D lists exactly 4<6<2<1<5<3, matching our derived order. No other option matches this sequence, so the correct choice is D).
