Because the two substituents on the alkene are identical propyl chains, the resulting epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is hence meso (achiral). Acid‐catalyzed epoxide opening then proceeds by anti attack of water at the protonated epoxide, giving the trans (anti) diol. Since the starting epoxide was meso, ring opening yields a single achiral meso diol—the (2R,3S) stereoisomer—rather than a racemic pair.; answer: A single achiral meso anti-diol: meso-(2R,3S)-octane-4,5-diol\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yhvd, determine stereochemical outcome of (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation, thinking: Epoxidation of a Z-alkene with mCPBA is a concerted syn addition: the two alkyl substituents that were cis on the double bond end up cis on the epoxide. For oct-4-ene the substituents on C4 and C5 are identical alkyl chains, so syn epoxidation of the Z isomer produces only the meso epoxide (an achiral, internally symmetric intermediate). Acid-catalyzed anti ring opening of this meso epoxide then gives the corresponding meso anti diol. No enantiomers are formed—only the single meso diastereomer (meso-octane-4,5-diol, i.e. the (2R,3S) diol).; answer: A single meso diol: meso-octane-4,5-diol (2R,3S)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent N7PG, combine stereoisomeric products, thinking: From sub‐tasks: (E) gives a racemic pair of anti diols (2R,3R) and (2S,3S); (Z) gives a single meso diol (2R,3S). Combined, there are three stereoisomers: two enantiomers plus one achiral meso. On an achiral (standard) HPLC, the enantiomers coelute, giving one peak, and the meso is separate, giving a second peak—total two peaks. On a chiral column, the enantiomers are resolved into two peaks, and the meso (achiral) is distinct, giving a third peak—total three peaks.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 4tHe, providing feedback, thinking: The combined product mixture contains only three distinct stereoisomers—two enantiomers (from the E‐alkene anti diol) and one achiral meso diol (from the Z‐alkene syn diol). On a standard (achiral) reverse‐phase column the enantiomers coelute, so you observe two peaks (one for the racemic pair and one for the meso). On a chiral column the enantiomers are resolved into two separate peaks plus the meso peak, giving three peaks. Limitation: you cannot achieve full resolution of all stereoisomers on an achiral HPLC; enantiomeric resolution requires a chiral stationary phase, and the achiral meso form remains inseparable into further stereoisomers.; answer: Cannot resolve enantiomers on standard HPLC (only 2 peaks), requires chiral column to get 3 peaks; mixture has only 3 stereoisomers (2 enantiomeric, 1 meso).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent N7PG, refining combined product mixture, thinking: The E‐alkene yields a racemic pair of anti diols ((2R,3R) and (2S,3S)); the Z‐alkene yields a single meso diol ((2R,3S)).
