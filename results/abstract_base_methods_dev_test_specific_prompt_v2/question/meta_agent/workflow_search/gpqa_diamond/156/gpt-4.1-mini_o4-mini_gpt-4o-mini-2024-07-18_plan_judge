Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Based on the stringent requirements for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of a retrovirus, the real‐time PCR approach (choice D) is the optimal platform. It builds on cDNA sequencing data to design highly specific primers and probes, allows quantitation, and supports inclusion of internal controls. Developing the kit involves: 1) Primer/probe optimization and master mix formulation for efficient one‐step RT‐PCR; 2) Analytical sensitivity testing with serial dilutions of quantified RNA to determine the limit of detection; 3) Analytical specificity testing against related viruses and human genomic material to confirm no cross‐reactivity; 4) Reproducibility studies (intra‐ and inter‐run, across operators and instruments); 5) Clinical validation using well‐characterized patient specimens to establish clinical sensitivity and specificity; 6) Integration of internal extraction and amplification controls; 7) Streamlined workflow for under 2‐hour turnaround; 8) Preparation of detailed protocols and quality control procedures for regulatory submission. This ensures a robust, rapid, and reliable diagnostic kit suitable for outbreak management.
