We incorporate an internal extraction and amplification control to monitor each step and include positive and negative controls in every run. Clinical validation requires testing well‐characterized patient samples (PCR positives and negatives confirmed by sequencing) to calculate clinical sensitivity and specificity. Turnaround time is optimized by using one‐step RT-PCR master mix and streamlined extraction, yielding results within 1–2 hours.
