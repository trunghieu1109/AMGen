Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We have an initial nucleus of rest‐mass energy M c²=300 GeV that fissions into two fragments with rest‐masses m1=2 m2 and m1+m2=0.99 M, so the mass deficit Q=0.01 M c²=3 GeV is released as kinetic energy. Non‐relativistically, the kinetic energy partition gives T1_class=Q⋅(m2/(m1+m2))=3 GeV⋅(1/3)=1 GeV=1000 MeV. Relativistically, conserving energy and momentum (p1=p2), the heavier fragment’s total energy E1 satisfies E1+E2=300 GeV and E2=√(p^2c^2+m2^2c^4), E1=√(p^2c^2+m1^2c^4). Solving yields E1≈199.005 GeV, so T1_rel≈E1−m1c^2≈1.005 GeV=1005 MeV. The difference T1_rel−T1_class≈5 MeV. This matches choice B).
