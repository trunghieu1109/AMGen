Of these, one is fixed at point P (the center), and the other twelve are constrained to lie at a distance of 2 m from P (i.e., on a spherical shell of radius 2 m around P).; answer - 13 charges in total: (1) one point charge of +2e fixed at point P; (2) twelve point charges each of +2e constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the electrostatic potential energy of point charges, we must know the Coulomb constant k, the values of the charges, and the separation distances between them. Coulomb’s law gives the potential energy for a pair of point charges as U = k·q1·q2 / r. Here each identical charge is 2e (where e is the elementary charge) and the distances between charges are specified (for example, 2 m from the central charge). Thus the relevant constants are k = 8.9875×10^9 N·m^2/C^2, e = 1.602×10^-19 C, and the formula U = k·q1·q2 / r (and for multiple charges, summing this over all unique pairs).; answer - Coulomb’s constant k = 8.9875×10^9 N·m^2/C^2; elementary charge e = 1.602×10^-19 C; each charge q = 2e; separation distance r = 2 m; potential energy formula U = k·q1·q2 / r (sum over all unique pairs).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We need only the interactions between the central charge (+2e) and each of the 12 outer charges (+2e at 2 m).  For one such pair: U_pair = k·q1·q2/r = (8.9875×10^9 N·m^2/C^2)·(2e)·(2e)/(2 m) = 2·k·e^2.  Thus total U = 12·(2·k·e^2) = 24·k·e^2.  Using e = 1.602×10^−19 C gives e^2 ≈2.5664×10^−38 C^2 and k·e^2 ≈2.307×10^−28 J, so U ≈24·2.307×10^−28 =5.536×10^−27 J.; answer - 5.536×10^-27 J\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To find the interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere, we note that in the minimum-energy (Thomson) configuration for 12 point charges they occupy the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere of radius R=2\u2009m.  In this arrangement there are 66 distinct charge-charge pairs: 30 edges of length d1=a, 30 “next-nearest” pairs of length d2=a·φ (φ=(1+√5)/2≈1.618), and 6 diametral pairs of length d3=2R=4\u2009m.
