Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_179
proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we obtained the total energy as 2.8216×10⁻²⁶ J. Rounding to three decimals in the mantissa gives 2.822×10⁻²⁶ J, which exactly matches choice A) 2.822×10⁻²⁶. None of the other options are this value. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
