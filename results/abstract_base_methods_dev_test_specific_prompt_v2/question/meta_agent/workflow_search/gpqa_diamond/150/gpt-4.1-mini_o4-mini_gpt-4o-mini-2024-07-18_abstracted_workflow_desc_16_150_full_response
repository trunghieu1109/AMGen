However, it hinges critically on the following limitations: 1) Both the state ψ and the eigenvector e₀ must be exactly normalized—any normalization error directly skews the probability. 2) It assumes the eigenvalue 0 is nondegenerate, so a single eigenvector spans the eigenspace; in cases of degeneracy one must project onto and sum contributions from an entire orthonormal basis of that eigenspace. 3) It neglects any time‐dependence of the observable or additional phase factors that do not affect probabilities but can matter in interference phenomena. 4) More generally, the projection postulate applies cleanly only for ideal von Neumann measurements and Hermitian operators with a complete orthonormal eigenbasis. In more complex scenarios—open systems, generalized measurements (POVMs), or degenerate spectra—the simple projection formula must be modified.; answer: Projection gives probability 1/3 but is valid only if the eigenvalue is nondegenerate, both state and eigenvector are normalized, and the measurement is an ideal projective measurement in a Hermitian operator’s orthonormal eigenbasis; otherwise one must project onto the full eigenspace or use the appropriate generalized measurement formalism.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Dt07, refining projection calculation, thinking: We have the normalized state ψ=(−1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6) and the normalized zero‐eigenvector e₀=(1/√2, 0, −1/√2).
