Spectroscopy shows that both stars peak at the same wavelength, so their peak wavelengths are identical. The radial velocities given are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. These are all the physical parameters explicitly provided.; answer - Radius ratio R1/R2 = 1.5; Mass ratio M1/M2 = 1.5; Radial velocities: Star_1 = 0 km/s, Star_2 = 700 km/s; Peak wavelengths: identical\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Wien’s displacement law states λ_max·T = b (where b ≈ 2.9×10^6 nm·K). Since both stars exhibit the same peak wavelength, λ_max, they must have the same temperature: T = b/λ_max. Without a numerical value for λ_max we can only conclude that T1 equals T2, i.e., both stars have identical effective temperatures.; answer - T1 = T2 (identical temperatures)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Using the Stefan–Boltzmann law L∝R²T⁴, we have R₁/R₂=1.5. Both stars have the same observed λ_max, but Star 2’s λ_max is redshifted by v/c, so its emitted λ_max=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Thus T₂=T_emitted=b/λ_emitted= T₁(1+v/c) ⇒ T₁/T₂=1/(1+700\u2009km/s / 300,000\u2009km/s)≈0.99767.

The observed λ_max are the same, but Star 2’s emitted λ_max is blue-shifted when observed: λ_emitted = λ_obs/(1 + v/c) with v = 700 km/s and c = 3×10⁵ km/s, so 1 + v/c ≈ 1.00233. Hence T₂ = b/λ_emitted = T₁(1 + v/c) ⇒ T₁/T₂ ≈ 1/1.00233 ≈ 0.99767. Then L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² × (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ 2.25 × (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 2.25 × 0.9922 ≈ 2.23.

Since both stars exhibit the same peak wavelength, λ_max, they must have the same temperature: T = b/λ_max. Without a numerical value for λ_max we can only conclude that T1 equals T2, i.e., both stars have identical effective temperatures.; answer: T1 = T2 (identical temperatures)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent InlL, determining temperatures, thinking: Wien’s displacement law gives T=b/λ_peak. The astronomers measured the same observed peak wavelength λ_obs for both stars. For Star 1 (v=0) the rest‐frame peak wavelength is λ1=λ_obs, so T1=b/λ_obs. Star 2 is receding at v=700 km/s, so its rest‐frame peak λ2=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Hence T2=b/λ2=(b/λ_obs)·(1+v/c)=T1·(1+700/3×10^5)≈T1·1.00233. Therefore the two stars have almost identical temperatures, with Star 2 hotter by only ≈0.23%.; answer: T1 = b/λ_obs,  T2 ≈T1×(1+700 km/s / 3×10^5 km/s) ≈1.00233\u2009T1\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent LftH, determining temperatures, thinking: Wien’s displacement law relates a blackbody’s peak wavelength λ_max to its temperature T by T=b/λ_max, where b≈2.90×10⁻³\u2009m·K. Since the spectroscopy shows both stars peak at the same λ_max, they must have the same temperature. Without a specific λ_max value we express their temperature symbolically. Therefore, T₁=T₂= b/λ_max.; answer: T₁ = T₂ = b/λ_max ≃ 2.90×10⁻³\u2009m·K\u2009/\u2009λ_max\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent vRAi, calculating luminosities, thinking: The luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 *(T1/T2)^4. Both stars have same observed peak wavelength, but Star_2’s motion at 700 km/s redshifts its observed λmax by (1+v/c), so its emitted λmax is λobs/(1+v/c), making T2 = b/λemitted = T1*(1+v/c). Thus T2/T1 = 1.002333. Therefore L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 2.25/1.00936 ≈ 2.23.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent aFWR, providing feedback, thinking: The luminosity ratio was derived using L∝R²T⁴ with R₁/R₂=1.5 and T₂/T₁≈1+v/c (v=700\u2009km/s) to correct the observed λmax via the Doppler effect. This yields L₁/L₂≈(1.5)²/(1.00233)⁴≈2.23.; answer: These calculations assume each star is a perfect blackbody and ignore real‐world complexities: stellar atmospheres and line opacities shift the true emission peak; limb and gravity darkening alter the effective emitting area; metallicity and composition affect both radius and T; uncertainties in radius and wavelength measurements propagate nonlinearly; higher‐order relativistic effects and interstellar extinction are neglected. Consequently, the derived factor (~2.23) is an idealized upper‐limit estimate rather than an exact physical value.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent vRAi, refining luminosity calculations, thinking: Using the Stefan–Boltzmann law L∝R²T⁴, we have R₁/R₂=1.5. Both stars have the same observed λ_max, but Star 2’s λ_max is redshifted by v/c, so its emitted λ_max=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Thus T₂=T_emitted=b/λ_emitted= T₁(1+v/c) ⇒ T₁/T₂=1/(1+700\u2009km/s / 300,000\u2009km/s)≈0.99767.

Given R1/R2 = 1.5 and T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c) ≈ 1/(1 + 700/300000) ≈ 0.99767, we compute L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99767)^4 = 2.25 * (0.99767)^4.
