Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_192
proposed answer: The cumulative number of stars within distance r scales as N(r) ∝ r^5. Differentiating gives the number per unit distance dN/dr ∝ 5r^4, so the star count varies as r^4 with distance. This matches choice ~r^4.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_192
proposed answer: We observe that the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵. Since parallax plx and distance r are related by plx = 1/r, we substitute plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵. To convert from a per-parallax distribution to a per-distance distribution, we use the chain rule: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·|d(plx)/dr|. We have d(plx)/dr = –1/r², so |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r². Multiplying gives dN/dr ∝ r⁵ × (1/r²) = r³. Among the given options (~r², ~r⁴, ~r³, ~r⁵), the scaling ~r³ corresponds to choice C).
