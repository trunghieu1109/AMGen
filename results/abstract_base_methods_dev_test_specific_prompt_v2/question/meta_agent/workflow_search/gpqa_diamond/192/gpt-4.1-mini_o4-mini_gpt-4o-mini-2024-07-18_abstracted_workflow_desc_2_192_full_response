A cumulative count N(<plx) would require integrating dN/dplx, which would change the exponent.

In star‐count studies one writes dN/dplx ∝ plx⁻⁵ and then converts to dN/dr. A cumulative N(<plx) would be obtained by integrating and would scale differently (∝ plx⁻⁴).

The phrasing implies how counts change per small parallax interval, i.e. dN/dplx ∝ plx⁻⁵. Substituting plx=1/r gives dN/dplx ∝ r⁵. Converting to distance space: dN/dr = (dN/dplx)·|dplx/dr| = r⁵·(1/r²) = r³.

However, this result assumes a uniform spatial density of stars, perfect completeness (no magnitude‐limit or detection biases), negligible interstellar extinction, and ignores measurement errors or parallax biases (e.g. Lutz–Kelker bias). It also neglects any clustering, gradients in density, or changes in the luminosity function with distance, so in real surveys the r³ law will only hold approximately over limited ranges.; answer: dN/dr ∝ r³\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent SCja, refining functional form of dN/dr, thinking: We interpret the given variation as a differential distribution: dN/dplx ∝ plx⁻⁵.
