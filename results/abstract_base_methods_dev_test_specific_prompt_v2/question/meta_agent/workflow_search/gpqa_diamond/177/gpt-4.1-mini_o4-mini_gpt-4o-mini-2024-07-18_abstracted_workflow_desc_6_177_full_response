Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, the coupling κ must supply the missing −1: [κ]ₘ + 5 = 4 ⇒ [κ]ₘ = −1.; answer: [κ]_M = -1\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 4NXV, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation that [κ]_M = –1 is sound because the operator ψ̄σ_{μν}ψF^{μν} has mass dimension 5 (ψ has 3/2, Fμν has 2), and the Lagrangian density must be dimension 4, so κ must carry dimension –1. This analysis assumes canonical (classical) dimensions in 4D and ignores any anomalous dimensions or higher‐loop effects.

In quantum field theory in four dimensions, any coupling with negative mass dimension leads to non-renormalizable interactions because higher-order loop diagrams generate divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.
