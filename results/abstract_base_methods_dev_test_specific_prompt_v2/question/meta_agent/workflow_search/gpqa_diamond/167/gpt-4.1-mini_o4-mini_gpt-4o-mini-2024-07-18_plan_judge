Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: The most stealthy, hard-to-spot errors in genomics arise from mismatches that don’t trigger parser failures: (2) the “chr”/no-“chr” prefix confusion, (3) reference assembly mismatches, and (4) incorrect ID conversions. Incompatible formats (#1) usually cause immediate errors or warnings, making them less insidious. Thus, the best choice listing the primary stealth error sources is 2, 3, and 4.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: The original question asks which issues are the most common stealth‐error sources in genomics data analysis. The evidence cited ranks all four listed problems—data format incompatibilities, “chr”/no-“chr” mismatches, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions—as independently significant contributors. The chosen answer (C) “All of the above” fully covers these documented error sources without omission. There is direct alignment between the evidence-based rankings and the selected option, no logical inconsistencies, and no missing issue. No corrections are needed.
