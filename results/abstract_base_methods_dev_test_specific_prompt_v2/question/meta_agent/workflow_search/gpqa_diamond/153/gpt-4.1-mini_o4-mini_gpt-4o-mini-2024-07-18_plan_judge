Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 (~32%) indicates one chlorine atom. The IR spectrum shows a broad O–H stretch (3500–2700 cm⁻¹) and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR displays a singlet at 11.0 ppm for the COOH proton and two aromatic doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm (2H each, J≈8 Hz), an AA′BB′ pattern indicative of para substitution on the benzene ring. Among the options, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid matches the molecular weight, the carboxylic acid functionality, and the para-disubstitution pattern.
