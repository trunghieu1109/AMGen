The sharp, intense peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group.

The sharp, strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid carbonyl. Together, these peaks unambiguously identify a carboxylic acid functional group in the compound.; answer: The IR data indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (broad O–H stretch and sharp C=O stretch).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 3w8j, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The 11.0 ppm singlet (1H) is the carboxylic acid proton. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) arise from the aromatic protons on a para-disubstituted benzene ring (two sets of equivalent protons, each coupling to the other set). This pattern fits 4-chlorobenzoic acid.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent mvRb, providing feedback, thinking: The original 1H NMR interpretation correctly assigns the 11.0 ppm singlet to a carboxylic acid proton and the two aromatic doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm to a para-disubstituted benzene pattern. However, it does not consider potential complicating factors.; answer: The 1H NMR analysis is limited by: 1) Exchangeable protons (COOH) can broaden or disappear depending on solvent and concentration. 2) Overlapping aromatic signals from other isomers or impurities could mimic a simple AA′BB′ pattern. 3) Lack of coupling constant values prevents confirmation of para coupling versus ortho or meta. 4) No information on non-aromatic or aliphatic regions, so other functional groups might be undetected.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 3w8j, refining 1H NMR analysis, thinking: The 11.0 ppm singlet (1H) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The two aromatic signals at 8.02 ppm (d, J≈8 Hz, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, J≈8 Hz, 2H) form an AA′BB′ pattern, consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring bearing one chlorine and one carboxylic acid.

The IR broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ stretch and strong 1720 cm⁻¹ peak are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (O–H and C=O). The ¹H NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) confirms the COOH proton. Two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) with J≈8 Hz form an AA′BB′ pattern, consistent with a para‐disubstituted benzene.

The IR broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ and strong 1720 cm⁻¹ peaks are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (O–H stretch and C=O). The ¹H NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is the COOH proton. Two aromatic doublets (8.02 ppm, 2H and 7.72 ppm, 2H, J≈8 Hz) give an AA′BB′ pattern consistent with a para‐disubstituted benzene ring. Of the options, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-chlorobenzoic acid) matches all features: MW 156 with one Cl, a carboxylic acid functional group, and para substitution on the ring.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent gwbJ, round 0, comparing structural choices, thinking: The molecular ion at m/z 156 (with M+2 at 158 ~32%) requires one Cl atom. The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H stretch plus a strong 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O stretch characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm is the COOH proton, and the two 2H doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm (J≈8 Hz) form an AA′BB′ pattern, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Of the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all data.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent CNRe, round 0, comparing structural choices, thinking: We look at each choice in light of the MS, IR, and 1H NMR data:\n\n1) 4-Chlorobenzoic acid: MW 156 with one Cl (M+2 ≈32%), IR shows broad 3500–2700\u2009cm⁻¹ (COOH O–H) and strong 1720\u2009cm⁻¹ (C=O), 1H NMR shows COOH singlet at 11.0\u2009ppm (1H) and two doublets at 8.02\u2009ppm (2H) and 7.72\u2009ppm (2H) with J≈8\u2009Hz—an AA′BB′ pattern of a para-disubstituted benzene. Perfect match.\n\n2) 2-Chlorobenzoic acid: Also MW 156, IR similar, and COOH proton appears, but ortho substitution gives more complex aromatic splitting (not a simple AA′BB′), and intramolecular H-bond would shift O–H differently. NMR pattern not two clean doublets.\n\n3) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: MW 156 with Cl, IR would show OH and C=O but the carbonyl at ~1700\u2009cm⁻¹ would be an aldehyde C=O, and the OH and CHO protons appear differently (aldehyde singlet near 10\u2009ppm plus multiple aromatic signals, not AA′BB′). Doesn’t fit.\n\n4) Phenyl chloroformate: MW 156 but no broad COOH O–H at ~3000\u2009cm⁻¹, different IR (C=O of carbonate ~1750\u2009cm⁻¹ only), and 1H NMR would show phenyl multiplet, not two doublets plus a COOH singlet.\n\nThus only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the data.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent ATij, round 0, comparing structural choices, thinking: The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 at 158 (~32%) indicates one chlorine atom. The IR broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H and sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O bands point to a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a 11.0 ppm singlet (COOH) and two aromatic doublets (8.02 ppm, 2H; 7.72 ppm, 2H; J≈8 Hz), an AA′BB′ pattern characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits the formula C7H5ClO2 (MW 156), the IR and NMR patterns for a para-chlorobenzoic acid. Ortho or meta chloro isomers give more complex splitting, and other options lack the COOH signature.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, making final structural suggestion, thinking: The molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (with an M+2 peak at 158, ~32%) requires one chlorine atom.
