In the variant decay (2A → 2B + 2E + M), there are still three bodies (2E + M), so kinematics remain three‐body and the electron sum energy spectrum remains continuous. Because only one massless M instead of two neutrinos carries away energy, the electrons on average (and at the kinematic limit) can carry off more energy, raising the endpoint above Q.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3MrX:\nIn the original decay 2A→2B+2E+2V, energy and momentum conservation with three final-state particle types (2E and 2V) allows a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles up to Q. In the variant decay 2A→2B+2E+M, we still have three final-state particles (2E+M), so the spectrum remains continuous. Moreover, replacing two heavier V particles with one massless M reduces the number of particles sharing the decay energy, allowing the E particles to carry more energy at the endpoint. Hence the endpoint energy increases while the spectrum stays continuous, matching choice C).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent QX4Z:\nReplacing two V particles with a single massless M still leaves three final-state particles (the two Es plus M), so energy and momentum conservation allow a continuous energy distribution for the Es. Moreover, with one less light particle siphoning off energy, the Es can carry more energy overall, raising the endpoint value above Q.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent VqjM:\nIn both the original 2A→2B+2E+2V decay and the variant 2A→2B+2E+M decay there are three final‐state particles, so energy and momentum conservation allow a continuous distribution of the outgoing E pair energy. However, replacing two V particles with a single massless M reduces the total non‐E mass and kinetic burden in the final state, allowing the Es to share more energy. Thus the endpoint of the E energy spectrum shifts upward.

Because they can carry off varying amounts of kinetic energy, the electrons’ total energy spectrum is continuous.

With four final‐state particles there are multiple ways to share the total available energy, so the sum of the E energies can span a continuous range. Conservation of energy and momentum among three or more bodies allows the E’s to trade energy with the V’s in infinitely many ways, smoothing out any discrete lines. The maximum total energy the E’s can collectively take occurs when the V’s carry off negligible kinetic energy; this defines the endpoint Q.; answer: The V particles provide extra degrees of freedom, making the E spectrum continuous with endpoint Q.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 4RSS, analyzing variant decay with particle M, thinking: Replacing two V particles with a single massless M still leaves three light final‐state particles (the two Es plus M).
