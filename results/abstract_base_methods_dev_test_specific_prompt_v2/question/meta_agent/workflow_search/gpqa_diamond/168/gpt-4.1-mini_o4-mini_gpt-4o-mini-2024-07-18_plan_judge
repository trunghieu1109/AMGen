Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In both the original decay (2A→2B+2E+2V) and the variant decay (2A→2B+2E+M), three final‐state bodies are involved (the two E’s plus either two V’s or one M). Three-body kinematics yields a continuous energy spectrum for the sum energy of the two E particles. By replacing two neutrinos (V) with a single massless M, there is less energy carried away by non-E particles, so the electrons can take off more of the decay energy. Thus the spectrum remains continuous and its endpoint increases above the original Q.
