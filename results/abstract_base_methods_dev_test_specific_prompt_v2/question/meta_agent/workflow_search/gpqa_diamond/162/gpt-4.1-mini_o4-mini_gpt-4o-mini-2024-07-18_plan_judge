Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_162
proposed answer: The required H⁺ moles are 0.00281 mol, so V = 0.00281 / 0.1 = 28.05 cm³, matching choice A. The Fe³⁺ concentration then gives pH ≈2.04, also matching choice A. No other option fits both criteria.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_162
proposed answer: We calculated the moles of Fe(OH)3 (0.100 g/106.9 g·mol⁻¹≈9.36×10⁻⁴ mol), requiring 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3 for dissolution, so n(H+)≈2.81×10⁻³ mol. At 0.1 M acid this is V≈28.1 cm³. After mixing in 100 cm³ total, [H+]≈(0.1 M×0.0281 L−0.00281 mol)/0.1 L≈7.5×10⁻³ M, giving pH≈2.12, closest to 2.04. The only option matching both volume and pH is A).
