The net induced charge on the cavity wall is –q, and +q resides on the outer surface. Outside the sphere the field is that of a point charge q at the sphere’s center regardless of the cavity offset. Therefore, for L>R, E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L².; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 8xdZ, determining electrostatic conditions, thinking: First, recall that in electrostatic equilibrium within a conductor the electric field must vanish everywhere in the conducting material. The cavity hosts the point charge +q, which induces a surface charge of –q on the inner wall of the cavity so that the field in the conductor itself is zero. To preserve overall neutrality of the conductor (it was initially uncharged), a compensating +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor. \n\n• Inside the metal (between the cavity and the outer surface): E = 0 by electrostatic shielding and boundary conditions.\n• Within the cavity: E is determined by superposition of the point‐charge +q and the induced charges on the cavity wall (not uniform, but arranged to cancel the field in the conductor). The field in the cavity is nonzero and given by the usual Coulomb contributions of +q plus the induced inner surface charge.\n• Outside the conductor: all the net induced +q on the outer surface acts like a point charge +q concentrated at the center of the conductor (by spherical symmetry of the outer surface). Thus for r>L>R, E = (1/4πε0)·q/L2, directed radially outward from the conductor’s center.; answer: Inside the conductor: E = 0. In the cavity: nonzero field from +q and its induced charges. Outside the conductor (r>L): E = (1/4πε0)·q/L2, as if a point charge +q sits at the conductor’s center.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ySIV, determining electrostatic conditions, thinking: Inside the conducting material the electric field must be zero, so induced charges appear: –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. These induced charges distribute so that outside the conductor the net field is that of a point charge +q located at the conductor’s centre. Therefore at distance L>R from the conductor’s centre, E=(1/4πε0) q/L², corresponding to choice D).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ymfO, deducing electric field outside conductor, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we have an uncharged conductor of radius R with an off-center cavity of radius r containing +q. Sub-task 2 established that induced charges –q appear on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface so that inside the conductor E=0. By Gauss’s law and the uniqueness theorem, the external field depends only on the net charge enclosed. The conductor plus its cavity is overall +q, so at any point P outside (distance L>R) the field is that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s center: E=(1/4πε0) q/L^2. This matches choice D).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent qXqW, providing feedback, thinking: The deduction correctly uses Gauss’s law and the uniqueness theorem to show that, for a spherical uncharged conductor with net charge +q, the external field must be identical to that of a point charge +q at the centre. This conclusion hinges on electrostatic equilibrium, spherical symmetry of the conductor, absence of external fields or time‐varying effects, and that L>R so that the Gaussian surface encloses all induced surface charge. It does not apply to points inside the conductor or cavity, to non‐spherical conductors, or to dynamic charge distributions.; answer: E outside = (1/4πε₀)·q/L²; valid only for L>R in static equilibrium for a spherical conductor carrying net charge +q.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ymfO, refining deduction, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we have an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R containing an off-center cavity with a point charge +q inside. Electrostatic equilibrium in the conductor forces the field within the metal to zero, so induced charge –q resides on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law, any closed surface outside the conductor (L>R) encloses net charge +q. Further, the conductor’s spherical shape ensures the external field is spherically symmetric.

By Gauss’s law any surface outside (L>R) encloses total charge +q. The spherical conductor ensures spherical symmetry of the external field, so at distance L the field is that of a point charge +q at the center: E=(1/4πε₀)·q/L².

By Gauss’s law any spherical surface of radius L>R around the conductor encloses net charge +q and the field must be radially symmetric. Hence the magnitude of the electric field at distance L is the same as that of a point charge +q at the origin. It is independent of the cavity offset s, the internal distance l, and the angle θ.

By Gauss’s law, any surface outside the conductor (radius L>R) encloses net charge +q. The symmetry of the spherical conductor guarantees the field outside depends only on L, not on the off‐center positions of the cavity or charge.
