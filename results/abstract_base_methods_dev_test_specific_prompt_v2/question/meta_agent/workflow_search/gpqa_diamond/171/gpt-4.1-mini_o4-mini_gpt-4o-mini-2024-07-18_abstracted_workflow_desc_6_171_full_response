Algebraically 1/T1−1/T2=(T2−T1)/(T1T2), so ln(2)= (ΔE/kB)(T1−T2)/(T1T2).  This matches exactly the form of choice D, ln(2) = (T1−T2)/(T1T2), whereas the other options have the wrong numerator or exponent.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1CvW:\nStarting from the Boltzmann distribution n₁/n₂=2=exp[−ΔE/k₈(1/T₁−1/T₂)], we take ln to get ln2=−ΔE/k₈(1/T₁−1/T₂). Noting (1/T₁−1/T₂)=(T₂−T₁)/(T₁T₂), we have −(1/T₁−1/T₂)=(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂). Hence ln2=(ΔE/k₈)·(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂). Among the choices, only option D has the form ln(2)=(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂), matching the derived relationship.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent zB3I:\nStarting from the Boltzmann distribution in LTE, we have n₁/n₂ = 2 = exp[−ΔE/(k_B) (1/T₁ − 1/T₂)]. Taking natural logs gives ln(2) = −ΔE/(k_B) (1/T₁ − 1/T₂). Noting that 1/T₁ − 1/T₂ = (T₂ − T₁)/(T₁T₂), we get −(1/T₁ − 1/T₂) = (T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂). Hence ln(2) = (ΔE/k_B)·(T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂). Among the choices, only option D matches this form of ln(2) = (T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 7Wno:\nUnder LTE the Boltzmann ratio gives n1/n2=2=exp[−ΔE/k(1/T1−1/T2)]. Taking ln yields ln2=−ΔE/k(1/T1−1/T2). But 1/T1−1/T2=(T2−T1)/(T1T2), so −(1/T1−1/T2)=(T1−T2)/(T1T2). Thus ln2=(ΔE/k)(T1−T2)/(T1T2).

To compare two stars, we take the ratio of these ratios: (n_j/n_i)_1 / (n_j/n_i)_2 = [exp(−ΔE/(k_B T1))] / [exp(−ΔE/(k_B T2))] = exp[−ΔE/k_B (1/T1 − 1/T2)].

This yields the compact form ln2=(ΔE/k_B)·(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂), matching choice D. Limitations: it assumes strict LTE with identical partition functions and level degeneracies in both stars, neglects non-LTE, line-blanketing or radiative transfer effects, presumes ΔE is large compared to kT so the Boltzmann law is sensitive to small ΔT, and ignores uncertainties in atomic data and observational noise.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Nzij, refining algebraic manipulation, thinking: Starting from the Boltzmann relation under LTE: n₁/n₂=2=exp[−ΔE/(k_B)(1/T₁−1/T₂)], taking natural logs gives ln(2)=−ΔE/k_B(1/T₁−1/T₂).
