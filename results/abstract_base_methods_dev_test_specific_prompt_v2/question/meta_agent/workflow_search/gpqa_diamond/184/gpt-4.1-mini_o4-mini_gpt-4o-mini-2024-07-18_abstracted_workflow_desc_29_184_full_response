This result hinges on treating σ as dimensionless Pauli matrices and n as a unit vector, so that no extra factors (e.g. ℏ/2) enter. If instead the Hamiltonian were written in terms of the spin operator S=(ℏ/2)σ, or if n were not normalized, or if additional terms were present in H, the spectrum would differ.
