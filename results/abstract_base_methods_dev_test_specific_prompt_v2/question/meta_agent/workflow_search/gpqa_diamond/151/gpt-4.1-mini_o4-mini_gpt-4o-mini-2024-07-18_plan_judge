Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_39_151
proposed answer: Active chromatin in the shmoo is defined by ongoing transcription, recruiting RNA polymerase II pre‐initiation complexes, enhancer‐associated factors, and nucleosomal histones. In contrast, the pre‐replication complex (pre‐RC) primarily assembles at replication origins during G1 to license DNA synthesis and is not stably maintained on transcriptionally active regions. Even though formaldehyde crosslinking can capture transient or indirect interactions and certain pre‐RC components may have non‐canonical roles or cell‐cycle–dependent presence, their overall abundance on active chromatin is minimal. Technical factors like antibody specificity and MS sensitivity may further reduce pre‐RC detection. Therefore, the pre‐replication complex will be the least observed protein complex in a ChIP–MS assay of active chromatin in the shmoo.
