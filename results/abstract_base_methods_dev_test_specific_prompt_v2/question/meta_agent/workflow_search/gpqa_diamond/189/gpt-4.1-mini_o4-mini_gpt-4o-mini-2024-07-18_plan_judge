Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_189
proposed answer: In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity decreases with increased solvation and resonance stabilization. Among the given nucleophiles: ethanethiolate (5) is the strongest because S– is larger and less solvated than O–; hydroxide (2) comes next; 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a localized alkoxide, more nucleophilic than the resonance-stabilized propionate (3); and neutral methanol (4) is the weakest. Thus the order is 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4, which exactly matches choice1.
