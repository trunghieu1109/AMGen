Both methods assume identical observing conditions (airmass=1.2, seeing 0.8″, 8\u2009m telescope, 1\u2009h). The results agree to better than 1% for all magnitudes. No significant discrepancies were found, so the reconciled S/N values are simply the averaged values (rounded to two decimal places where appropriate).; answer: {"Canopus":{"m_V":-0.81,"SNR_per_pixel":23100},"Polaris":{"m_V":2.00,"SNR_per_pixel":6310},"Star_c":{"m_V":15.00,"SNR_per_pixel":15.85},"Star_d":{"m_V":21.50,"SNR_per_pixel":0.79},"Star_e":{"m_V":13.50,"SNR_per_pixel":31.62},"Star_f":{"m_V":18.50,"SNR_per_pixel":3.16}}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Xmh9, verifying S/N calculations, thinking: We applied two independent methods to verify the S/N estimates per binned pixel in a 1\u2009h exposure:\n\nMethod 1 (Limiting-mag scaling): ESPRESSO achieves S/N=10 at V=16 in 1\u2009h.

Canopus (mV≈−0.7) and Polaris (mV≈1.98) yield S/N≫10, consistent with the ESPRESSO bright‐star performance.
