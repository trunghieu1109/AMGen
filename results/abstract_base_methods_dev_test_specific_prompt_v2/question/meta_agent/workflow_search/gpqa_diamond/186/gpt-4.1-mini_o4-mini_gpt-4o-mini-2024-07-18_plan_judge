Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_186
proposed answer: We found that Canopus, Polaris, the 15 mag star at 10 pc, and the 15 mag star at 5 pc each reach S/N≥10 in a 1 h ESPRESSO exposure on an 8 m VLT, for a total of 4 detectable stars. The option matching 4 is A).

proposed answer: We determined which stars achieve S/N≥10 in a 1 hr exposure with ESPRESSO on an 8 m VLT. Canopus (mV≈–0.7) and Polaris (mV≈1.98) clearly exceed the threshold. For the M_V=15 stars: at 5 pc mV=13.5 and at 10 pc mV=15 both reach S/N≥10, while at 50 pc (mV≈18.5) and 200 pc (mV≈21.5) they fall below. That yields a total of four detectable stars, matching choice A).
