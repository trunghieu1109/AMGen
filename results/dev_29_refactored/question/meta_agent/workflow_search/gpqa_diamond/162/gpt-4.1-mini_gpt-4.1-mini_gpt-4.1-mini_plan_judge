Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_162
proposed answer: Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: mass = 0.1 g, molar mass ≈ 106.87 g/mol, moles = 0.1 / 106.87 ≈ 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. Step 2: Calculate moles of OH- released: 3 moles OH- per mole Fe(OH)3, so moles OH- = 3 * 9.36 x 10^-4 = 2.808 x 10^-3 mol. Step 3: Calculate moles of H+ needed to neutralize OH-: equal to moles OH- = 2.808 x 10^-3 mol. Step 4: Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid needed: volume = moles / concentration = 2.808 x 10^-3 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. Step 5: Compare with given choices: Choice A has 28.05 cm3 acid volume and pH 2.04, which closely matches calculated acid volume and expected pH. Step 6: Other choices have acid volumes and pH values less consistent with stoichiometric neutralization and expected pH. Step 7: Therefore, choice A is the best match for minimum acid volume and resulting pH.
