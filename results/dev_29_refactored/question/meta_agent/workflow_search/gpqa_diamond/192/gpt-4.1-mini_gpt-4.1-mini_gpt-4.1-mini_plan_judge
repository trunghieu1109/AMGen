Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_192
proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as N(plx) ~ 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance r, i.e., plx ∝ 1/r. Therefore, we can write plx = k/r for some constant k. Substituting this into the given relation, we get N(plx) ~ 1/(k/r)^5 = (r/k)^5 ∝ r^5. This N(plx) represents the cumulative number of stars up to distance r because parallax decreases as distance increases, so counting stars with parallax greater than a certain value corresponds to counting stars within a certain distance. The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance r, which is the differential distribution dN/dr. Differentiating N(r) ∝ r^5 with respect to r gives dN/dr ∝ 5r^4, which simplifies to a power law of r^4. This means the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as r^4. Among the given options, this corresponds to choice B). This reasoning is consistent with astrophysical principles and the problem constraints, correctly interpreting the inverse relationship between parallax and distance, and converting the cumulative distribution into a differential distribution per unit distance. Therefore, the correct answer is B).
