Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity inside it, containing a charge +q. The conductor is initially uncharged and electrostatic equilibrium requires the electric field inside the conductor's material to be zero. The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the cavity surface and on the outer surface of the conductor. The conductor as a whole remains neutral, but the induced charges rearrange to shield the interior conductor material from any electric field. From the outside perspective, the conductor with the cavity and the charge inside behaves like a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is because the conductor shields any asymmetry caused by the offset cavity and the position of the charge inside it. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor (distance L from the conductor's center) depends only on the total charge +q and the distance L, and is given by E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). The distances l and s and the angle θ do not affect the external field. Hence, the correct choice is D. This conclusion is consistent with the uniqueness theorem in electrostatics and the shielding property of conductors, which ensures that the external field depends only on the total charge and its effective position (here, the conductor's center).
