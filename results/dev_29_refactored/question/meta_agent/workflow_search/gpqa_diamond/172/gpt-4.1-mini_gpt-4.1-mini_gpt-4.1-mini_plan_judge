Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_172
proposed answer: The problem involves estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron moving at a high speed with a given uncertainty in position Δx. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, we first estimate the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^(-10) m, and ħ ≈ 1.05 × 10^(-34) Js, Δp ≈ ħ/(2 Δx) ≈ 5.3 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The kinetic energy E of the electron is related to momentum p by E = p^2/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated by ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp = v Δp, where v = 2 × 10^8 m/s and m = 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg. Substituting values, ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8) × (5.3 × 10^(-25)) = 1.06 × 10^(-16) J, which is approximately 10^(-16) J. This estimate is consistent across multiple independent calculations and is significantly larger than the other options (~10^(-19) J, ~10^(-18) J, ~10^(-17) J). Although the electron's speed is relativistic, the order of magnitude estimate remains valid for this uncertainty calculation. Therefore, the best matching candidate for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is choice C) ~10^(-16) J.
