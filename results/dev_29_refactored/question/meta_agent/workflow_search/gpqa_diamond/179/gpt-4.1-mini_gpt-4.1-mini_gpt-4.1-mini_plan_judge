Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_179
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the minimum electrostatic potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge 2e. One charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are constrained to lie on a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P. The total potential energy includes the interaction between the central charge and each of the 12 charges on the sphere, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves. The minimum energy configuration of the 12 charges on the sphere is a classic problem related to distributing charges evenly on a sphere to minimize repulsion. Given the options, the energy values are very small except for option D, which is very large and unrealistic for this scale. The calculated minimum energy from previous detailed calculations and physical reasoning aligns best with option A) 2.822 x 10^-26 J, which is a plausible magnitude for electrostatic energy at this scale with charges of 2e and distances of meters. Therefore, the best matching candidate for the minimum energy is option A. This choice is consistent with physical principles, the scale of charges and distances involved, and the expected order of magnitude for electrostatic potential energy in such a system. The rounding to three decimals is also consistent with the given option format.
