Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. Kepler's third law states that the total mass M of a binary system is proportional to a^3 / P^2, where a is the semi-major axis and P is the orbital period. The semi-major axis a can be estimated from the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2) and the period P, assuming circular orbits and edge-on inclination (valid due to eclipses). The relation is a ∝ (K1 + K2) * P. For system_1: P1 = 2 years, K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, so a1 ∝ 15 * 2 = 30. For system_2: P2 = 1 year, K1 + K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s, so a2 ∝ 25 * 1 = 25. Now, the mass ratio M1/M2 = (a1^3 / P1^2) / (a2^3 / P2^2) = (30^3 / 2^2) / (25^3 / 1^2) = (27000 / 4) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, or roughly 0.4 times. This matches choice A. This calculation assumes circular orbits, edge-on inclination, and that the periods correspond exactly to orbital periods, which are reasonable given the problem context. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.4.
