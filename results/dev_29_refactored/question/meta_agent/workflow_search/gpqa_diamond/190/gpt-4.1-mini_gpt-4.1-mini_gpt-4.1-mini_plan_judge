Iteration: Test New Architecture_190
proposed answer: Step 1: The starting material 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and an isopropenyl group at position 5 on a cyclohexanone ring. Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl substituent, making it a strong nucleophile. Subsequent reaction with benzyl bromide (BnBr) alkylates this oxygen, forming a benzyl ether at position 3. This protects the hydroxyl group as a benzyl ether, yielding product 1.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl. This converts the ketone at position 1 into a tosylhydrazone derivative (product 2). This is a common method to transform ketones into hydrazones, which can be further manipulated.

Step 3: Treatment of product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature followed by aqueous ammonium chloride induces a Shapiro reaction. The Shapiro reaction converts the tosylhydrazone into an alkene by elimination of nitrogen gas. Here, the ketone at position 1 is converted into an alkene, specifically a vinyl group at position 1, forming product 3.

Step 4: Product 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere. This step reduces the alkene formed at position 1 to an alkane, saturating the double bond. Additionally, the isopropenyl group at position 5 is hydrogenated to an isopropyl group. Importantly, benzyl ethers are known to be cleaved under these hydrogenation conditions, regenerating the free hydroxyl group at position 3.

Final product 4 is thus a cyclohexane ring with a free hydroxymethyl group at position 3, an isopropyl group at position 5, and a saturated carbon at position 1 (originally the ketone carbon). This corresponds to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.

Other options are inconsistent with the reaction sequence: option B retains the tosylhydrazone, which is consumed; option C retains the benzyl ether, which is cleaved; option D shows a butyl substituent at position 1, which is not introduced in the sequence.

Therefore, the correct final product is option A.
