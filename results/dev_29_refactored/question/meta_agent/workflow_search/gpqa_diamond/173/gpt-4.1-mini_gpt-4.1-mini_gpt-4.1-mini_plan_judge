Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest-mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses in a 2:1 ratio, and the total rest mass after fission is 99% of the initial mass, indicating a 1% mass defect converted into kinetic energy (3 GeV). Assigning the lighter fragment mass m and the heavier fragment mass 2m, we get m = 99 GeV/c^2 and 2m = 198 GeV/c^2. Conservation of momentum requires equal and opposite momenta for the fragments. The kinetic energy of the heavier fragment T1 is calculated relativistically as T1 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + (2m)^2 c^4) - 2m c^2, and classically as T1_classical = p^2/(2 * 2m). Because the kinetic energies are significant, relativistic effects cause the relativistic kinetic energy to be slightly higher than the classical approximation. Detailed calculations show this difference to be on the order of a few MeV. Among the given options (2, 5, 10, 20 MeV), 10 MeV is the most reasonable estimate for the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the heavier fragment. Smaller values underestimate relativistic corrections, and larger values exceed the total kinetic energy margin. Therefore, the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and classical T1 is approximately 10 MeV, making option A) the correct choice.
