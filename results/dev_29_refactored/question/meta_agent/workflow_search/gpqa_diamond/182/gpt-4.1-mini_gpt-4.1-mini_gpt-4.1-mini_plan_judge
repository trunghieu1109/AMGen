Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_182
proposed answer: The starting compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has several elements contributing to its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD): one ring (cyclohexane ring) contributes 1 IHD, one double bond in the ring (cyclohex-3-ene) contributes 1 IHD, the vinyl substituent (CH=CH2) contributes 1 IHD, the formyl group (aldehyde carbonyl) contributes 1 IHD, and the carboxylic acid group (carbonyl) contributes 1 IHD. Summing these gives a total IHD of 5. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a strong reducing environment that typically reduces carbonyl groups (aldehydes and carboxylic acids) to saturated hydrocarbons and reduces double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid carbonyl groups lose their double bonds, removing 2 IHD. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl double bond are also reduced, removing 2 more IHD. The ring itself remains intact, contributing 1 IHD. Hence, the product retains only the ring's IHD, which is 1. This is consistent with chemical principles and the known effects of red phosphorus and HI on such functional groups. Therefore, the correct IHD of the product is 1, corresponding to choice A).
