Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves three Michael addition reactions producing products A, B, and C. The key mechanistic insight is that nucleophiles attack the β-carbon of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, forming resonance-stabilized intermediates. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate forms an enolate nucleophile that attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate at the β-position, yielding a tricarboxylate ester with the p-tolyl substituent at the 3-position relative to the malonate core. This matches trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and after acidic workup, the product is a hydroxy-substituted cyclohexene derivative, specifically 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, consistent with Michael addition followed by protonation and tautomerization. For reaction (C), compound C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which undergoes Michael addition with but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions. The hydroxy form is favored as it represents the enol tautomer facilitating enolate formation and conjugate addition, yielding 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Among the options, only choice 3 correctly assigns all three products with the correct substitution pattern, tautomeric form, and functional groups. Other options misplace substituents, confuse hydroxy and oxo forms, or incorrectly identify the tautomeric state of compound C. Multiple mechanistic analyses and expert reasoning support this conclusion. Therefore, choice C is the most chemically consistent and correct answer.
