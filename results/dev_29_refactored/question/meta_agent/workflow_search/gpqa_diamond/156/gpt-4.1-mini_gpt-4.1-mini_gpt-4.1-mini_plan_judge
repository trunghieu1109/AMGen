Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_156
proposed answer: The diagnostic kit design based on Choice D, which involves identifying the virus by performing cDNA sequencing followed by developing a real-time PCR kit, is well-suited for detecting a retrovirus. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so direct DNA sequencing (Choice A) is not appropriate without reverse transcription. ELISA targeting IgG antibodies (Choice B) detects the host immune response, which may not be present early in infection, thus delaying diagnosis. Symptom-based identification (Choice C) is indirect and less specific, and nested PCR, while sensitive, is more complex and time-consuming. Real-time PCR after cDNA synthesis allows for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of viral RNA, enabling early diagnosis. The design should include RNA extraction, reverse transcription to cDNA, primer and probe design targeting conserved viral sequences, and real-time PCR amplification with fluorescence detection. Potential improvements include ensuring primer specificity to avoid cross-reactivity, validating the assay with clinical samples, and optimizing reaction conditions for speed and sensitivity. Overall, the design is ready but should include thorough validation and quality control steps to ensure reliability in diverse clinical settings.
