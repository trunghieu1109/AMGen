Iteration: Test New Architecture_169
proposed answer: The spin state is given as |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). First, normalize the state: the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator along y is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Calculate S_y|ψ⟩: 
σ_y|ψ⟩ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i/5, 4/5]^T = [-(i)(4/5), (i)(3i/5)]^T = [-4i/5, 3i^2/5]^T = [-4i/5, -3/5]^T.
Then, S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i/5, -3/5]^T.
Now, calculate ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (3i/5)*^* * (-4iħ/10) + (4/5)*^* * (-3ħ/10) = (-4iħ/10)*( -3i/5) + (-3ħ/10)*(4/5) = ( -4iħ/10)*( -3i/5) + (-3ħ/10)*(4/5).
Calculate each term:
First term: (-4iħ/10)*(-3i/5) = ( -4i * -3i ) * (ħ/10*5) = (12 i^2) * (ħ/50) = 12*(-1)*(ħ/50) = -12ħ/50 = -6ħ/25.
Second term: (-3ħ/10)*(4/5) = -12ħ/50 = -6ħ/25.
Sum: -6ħ/25 + (-6ħ/25) = -12ħ/25.
Therefore, the expectation value is -12ħ/25.
Comparing with the choices, choice B) is '-12*hbar/25', which matches exactly.
Hence, the correct answer is B).
