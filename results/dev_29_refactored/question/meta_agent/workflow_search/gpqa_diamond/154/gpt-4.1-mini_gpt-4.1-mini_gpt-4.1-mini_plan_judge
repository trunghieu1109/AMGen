Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz in the given state, we use the standard quantum mechanical definition of uncertainty: ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). The state vector |ψ⟩ is given in the eigenbasis of Pz, where the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors. The state vector is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). First, we verify normalization: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, so the state is normalized. Next, calculate the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ = Σ |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Then, calculate ⟨Pz²⟩ = Σ |c_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2 = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/2)ħ². The variance is ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ². Taking the square root gives ΔPz = ħ/√2. This matches choice C). This step-by-step calculation confirms that the uncertainty in Pz for the given state is ħ/√2.
