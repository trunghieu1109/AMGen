proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 total configurations. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). We need to find the partition function Z = sum over all configurations of e^{-βE}. To do this, we enumerate the energies for all configurations: 1) When all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product S_i S_j = +1, so the sum of pairs is 3, and energy E = -3J. There are 2 such configurations. 2) When two spins are +1 and one is -1, or two spins are -1 and one is +1, the pair products sum to -1, so energy E = +J. There are 6 such configurations. Therefore, the partition function is Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Comparing with the given choices, only choice A matches this expression exactly. Choices B, C, and D have incorrect exponents or coefficients inconsistent with the energy levels and multiplicities. Hence, the correct partition function is choice A.
