Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_159
proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon approaches a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is well-known: the first minimum occurs at an angle \( \theta_1 \) where \( ka \sin \theta_1 = 3.8317 \), where k = 2\pi/\lambda. For small angles, \( \sin \theta \approx \theta \), so \( \theta_1 = 3.8317 \lambda / (2 \pi a) = 0.61 \lambda / a \). The first minimum is at 0.61 \lambda / a. The second minimum occurs at the second zero of the Bessel function, which is approximately 7.0156, so \( \theta_2 = 7.0156 \lambda / (2 \pi a) = 1.116 \lambda / a \). The angular distance between the first two minima is \( \theta_2 - \theta_1 = (1.116 - 0.61) \lambda / a = 0.506 \lambda / a \). Among the given options, 0.506 \lambda / a corresponds to choice 4. Therefore, the correct answer is D).
