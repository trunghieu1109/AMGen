proposed answer: The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 arises from radiative corrections involving loop contributions from various particles in the extended Standard Model. These contributions are proportional to the fourth power of the masses of particles running in the loops, weighted by coefficients alpha_i. Bosonic loops contribute positively, while fermionic loops contribute negatively due to their statistics. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the scalar fields are given as <phi> = x and <h> = v, and the total VEV squared (x^2 + v^2) appears in the denominator as a normalization factor consistent with the loop suppression factor 1/(8 pi^2 (x^2 + v^2)). Among the given choices, choice 1 lacks the top quark mass term, which is a significant fermionic contribution and should appear with a negative sign. Choice 4 incorrectly places the factor (x^2 + v^2) in the numerator, which contradicts the expected suppression from loop corrections. Choices 2 and 3 both include the top quark term with a negative sign, which is physically expected. Choice 3 is more complete as it includes the pseudoscalar mass M_{A^0}^4 with a positive sign and distinguishes the coefficients for the singlet fermion contributions (alpha_7 and alpha_8), reflecting a more detailed and accurate treatment of the scalar sector and fermionic contributions. Therefore, the correct and consistent formula for the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 through radiative corrections is given by choice 3.
