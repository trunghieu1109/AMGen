Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope depends on the apparent magnitude, which is calculated from the absolute magnitude and distance using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5. For stars c-f with absolute magnitude 15: at 5 pc, apparent magnitude m ≈ 13.5; at 10 pc, m = 15; at 50 pc, m ≈ 18.5; at 200 pc, m ≈ 21.5. ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent magnitude up to about 15 with S/N ≥ 10 in 1 hour exposure. Canopus and Polaris are bright stars with apparent magnitudes well within detection limits. Therefore, detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, star at 5 pc, and star at 10 pc, totaling 4 stars. Stars at 50 pc and 200 pc are too faint to be detected under these conditions.
