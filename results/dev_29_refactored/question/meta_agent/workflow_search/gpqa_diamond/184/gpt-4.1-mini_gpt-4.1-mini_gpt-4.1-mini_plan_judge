proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n is Hermitian and satisfies (σ · n)^2 = I, which implies its eigenvalues are ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of σ · n remain ±1. Multiplying by ε scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The options involving ħ/2 correspond to the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ, but the Hamiltonian is expressed directly in terms of σ, not S. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. This matches choice A). Considering all possible interpretations and the standard quantum mechanics conventions, the correct eigenvalues are ±ε, consistent with the properties of Pauli matrices and the given Hamiltonian. Hence, the correct answer is A).
