Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_157
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation located in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor subunit. Dominant-negative mutations typically produce mutant proteins that can still interact with the wild-type protein, often by dimerization, but form nonfunctional or deleterious complexes that inhibit the function of the wild-type protein. Since mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein likely still dimerizes with the wild-type protein but disrupts the normal function of the dimer. This disruption can lead to protein aggregation or formation of defective dimers that sequester the wild-type protein, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype despite the presence of one wild-type allele. Option A (loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype) is inconsistent because dominant-negative mutations usually require interaction with the wild-type protein to exert their effect. Option C (protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele) is less typical because dominant-negative mutations generally act by forming defective complexes rather than promoting degradation of the wild-type protein. Option D (change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype) contradicts the dominant-negative nature of the mutation, which implies interference with normal function rather than enhancement. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, consistent with option B.
