Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_151
proposed answer: The assay targets active chromatin in the shmoo formed by yeast treated with a quorum-sensing peptide. Active chromatin is associated with transcriptionally active regions, where the pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complexes, and nucleosome histone complexes are expected to be present. The pre-initiation complex is essential for transcription initiation, enhancer complexes regulate transcription, and nucleosomes are fundamental chromatin units present in all chromatin states. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication origin licensing and is primarily active during the G1 phase to prepare for DNA replication. Although shmoo formation involves G1 arrest, the focus on active chromatin related to transcription means the pre-replication complex proteins are less likely to be abundant or present in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Therefore, the pre-replication complex will be the least observed protein complex in this assay.
