proposed answer: The question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. The substituents on the benzene ring influence the regioselectivity of the substitution reaction. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as CH3 (methyl) and C2H5 (ethyl) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions. Among these, the ethyl group is bulkier than methyl, causing more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which increases the para-isomer fraction. Halogens like Cl are deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance effects, so chlorobenzene has moderate para selectivity. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as NO2 (nitro), COOH (carboxyl), and COOC2H5 (ester) deactivate the ring and are meta directing, resulting in low para-isomer yields. Among these, NO2 is the strongest EWG and thus has the lowest para-isomer yield, followed by the ester group and then the carboxyl group. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield is NO2 < COOC2H5 < COOH < Cl < CH3 < C2H5, which corresponds to choice B. This order is consistent with the known directing effects and steric considerations in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.
