Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The observed peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared/optical spectrum suggests a redshifted emission feature. Assuming the intrinsic emission peak is around the ultraviolet/optical range (e.g., Lyman-alpha at 121.6 nm or typical quasar emission lines around 100-200 nm), the redshift z can be estimated roughly by (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. For example, if the intrinsic emission is Lyman-alpha at 121.6 nm, then z = (790/121.6) - 1 â‰ˆ 5.5. Using the Lambda-CDM cosmology with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, and flat universe, the comoving distance for z ~ 5.5 is approximately 8-9 Gpc. Among the choices 6, 7, 8, and 9 Gpc, 8 Gpc is the best estimate for the comoving distance to the quasar. This matches typical cosmological calculators and literature values for such redshifts. Therefore, the best matching candidate is 8 Gpc.
