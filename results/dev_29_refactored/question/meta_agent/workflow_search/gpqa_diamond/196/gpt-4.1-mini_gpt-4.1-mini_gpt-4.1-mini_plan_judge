proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows a broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, characteristic of the O–H stretch of a carboxylic acid, and a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) typical of carboxylic acids. The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of a benzene ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (each 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) correspond to a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically reduces nitro groups to amines or replaces halogens with hydrogens but does not reduce carboxylic acids, so the carboxylic acid group remains intact. Among the options, only 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid matches all spectral data and the expected reaction outcome. Other options either lack the carboxylic acid proton and IR features or have different alkyl substituents inconsistent with the NMR data. Therefore, the final product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.
