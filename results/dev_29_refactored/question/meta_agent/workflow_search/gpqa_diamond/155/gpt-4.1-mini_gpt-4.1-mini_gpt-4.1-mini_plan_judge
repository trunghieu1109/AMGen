proposed answer: The chemist performs epoxidation on (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. The epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA is stereospecific, producing epoxides that retain the stereochemistry of the double bond. The (E)- and (Z)- isomers will give different diastereomeric epoxides. After aqueous acid treatment, the epoxides may be opened, but the stereochemical differences remain, resulting in stereoisomers. Since the starting alkenes are geometric isomers, their epoxidation products are diastereomers, not enantiomers. Each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers (due to the two faces of the alkene), so each reaction yields two stereoisomers. Combining both reactions yields four stereoisomers total: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. On an achiral HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute, so each pair of enantiomers appears as one peak. Diastereomers separate, so the (E)- and (Z)- derived epoxides appear as two peaks. Therefore, the standard HPLC shows 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so each pair of enantiomers appears as two peaks. Since there are two pairs of enantiomers (from (E) and (Z)), the chiral HPLC shows 4 peaks. Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC. This corresponds to choice B).
