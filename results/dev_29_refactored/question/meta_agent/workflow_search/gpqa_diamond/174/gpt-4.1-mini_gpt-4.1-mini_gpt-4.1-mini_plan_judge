Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the far field depends on the angle θ from the z-axis and the wavelength λ. The maximum power A occurs at the angle where the radiation intensity is highest. For a dipole-like radiation pattern, typical for such oscillating charge distributions, the angular dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ. This means the maximum power A is at θ = 90°, where sin²90° = 1. At θ = 30°, sin²30° = (1/2)² = 1/4, so the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, dipole radiation power scales as ω⁴, where ω = 2πc/λ, which translates to a λ⁻⁴ dependence. Higher multipole moments (like quadrupole) would have steeper wavelength dependencies (e.g., λ⁻⁶), but these are less likely dominant here given the problem context. The spheroidal shape and oscillation frequency suggest dipole radiation dominates, so the function f(λ, θ) can be expressed as proportional to λ⁻⁴ sin²θ. Among the given choices, only choice 3 ('1/4, λ^(-4)') matches both the angular fraction and the wavelength scaling consistent with dipole radiation theory. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or wavelength dependencies inconsistent with the dominant dipole radiation pattern. Therefore, the best and physically consistent answer is choice 3.
