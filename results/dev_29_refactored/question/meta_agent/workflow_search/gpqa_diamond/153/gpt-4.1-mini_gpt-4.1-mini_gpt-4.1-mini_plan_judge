Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a corresponding isotopic peak at m/z = 158 (about one-third intensity) clearly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom due to the natural isotopic distribution of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H, which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H, which is consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring where the two sets of equivalent protons couple to each other. Among the given options, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only compound that fits all these criteria: it contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para substitution pattern on the benzene ring that explains the NMR splitting pattern. The other options either have different substitution patterns (ortho or meta) or different functional groups (aldehyde or ester), which would produce different spectral features. Therefore, the spectral evidence strongly supports 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.
