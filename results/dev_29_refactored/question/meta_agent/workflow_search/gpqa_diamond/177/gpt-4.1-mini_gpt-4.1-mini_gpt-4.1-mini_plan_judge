proposed answer: The interaction Lagrangian is given by \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). In four-dimensional spacetime with natural units (\( \hbar = c = 1 \)), the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is always 4. The Dirac spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2, so \( \bar{\psi} \) also has dimension 3/2. The operator \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) constructed from gamma matrices is dimensionless. The electromagnetic field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. Therefore, the combined operator \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5 \). To ensure the interaction Lagrangian has the correct mass dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction in the usual power-counting sense because it leads to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Among the given choices, the one that states \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable matches this conclusion. This answer is consistent with standard QFT principles and the problem requirements. Therefore, the most reliable and correct choice is C).
