Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in two stars under LTE conditions. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in a given energy state between two stars at temperatures T1 and T2 is given by:

n1/n2 = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Given that n1/n2 = 2, taking the natural logarithm yields:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

Rearranging the difference of reciprocals:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)

Substituting back:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)

The problem's candidate equations omit the constant factor ΔE/k, focusing on the algebraic form relating T1 and T2. Ignoring ΔE/k, the correct form is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)

This matches choice D exactly.

Checking other choices:
- Choice A (ln(2) = T2 / T1) does not represent the difference of reciprocals and is inconsistent with the Boltzmann relation.
- Choice B (ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)^2) incorrectly squares the denominator, which is not supported by the derivation.
- Choice C (ln(2) = (T1 + T2) / (T1 * T2)) uses the sum instead of the difference, which contradicts the difference of inverse temperatures in the Boltzmann factor.

Therefore, choice D is the only physically plausible and mathematically consistent equation under LTE assumptions. It correctly relates the excitation ratio to the difference in inverse temperatures, consistent with the Boltzmann distribution. This holds for all positive temperatures T1 and T2, as expected physically.

Hence, the final validated and corrected equation is choice D.
