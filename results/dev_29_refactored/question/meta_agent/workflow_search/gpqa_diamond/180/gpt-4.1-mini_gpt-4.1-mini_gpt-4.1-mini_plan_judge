proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain produces neutrinos predominantly in the higher energy range, specifically contributing significantly to the 800-900 keV band (band 2). The 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos mainly come from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which continue unaffected in this hypothetical scenario. When the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the neutrino flux in band 2 will drop substantially because its dominant source is removed. Meanwhile, the flux in band 1 remains roughly the same since the other branches continue as normal. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) will increase significantly because the denominator (flux in band 2) decreases sharply while the numerator remains nearly constant. Given typical solar neutrino spectra and flux contributions, this increase is about one order of magnitude, making the ratio approximately 10. Ratios like 0.1 or 0.01 would imply a decrease or negligible change in the ratio, which contradicts the physical understanding. A ratio of 1 would mean no change, which is also unlikely given the loss of the pp-III contribution to band 2. Hence, the best approximate ratio among the given choices is 10.
