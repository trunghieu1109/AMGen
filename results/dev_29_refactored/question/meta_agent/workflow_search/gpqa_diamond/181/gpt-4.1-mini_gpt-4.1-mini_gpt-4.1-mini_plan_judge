proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device with no injection barrier, meaning the contact must be Ohmic to allow free carrier injection. The equation also assumes negligible diffusion current, as the current is dominated by drift under space-charge-limited conditions. The presence of traps or two-carrier conduction would complicate the current-voltage relationship and invalidate the simple Mott-Gurney form. Similarly, a Schottky contact introduces a barrier that limits carrier injection, violating the assumptions. Negligible drift current is inconsistent with the SCLC regime, which is dominated by drift current. Therefore, the statement that best satisfies the validity conditions is the one describing a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This corresponds to choice A).
