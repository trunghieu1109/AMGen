proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), defined on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. The conformal factor is Ω^2 = 32 / (4 - r^2), where r^2 = x^2 + y^2. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we integrate the area element dA = Ω^2 dx dy over the disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (r, θ), the Euclidean area element is r dr dθ, so the metric area element is (32 / (4 - r^2)) * r dr dθ. The total area A is ∫_{θ=0}^{2π} ∫_{r=0}^{2} (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr dθ = 2π ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr = 64π ∫_0^2 (r / (4 - r^2)) dr. Substituting u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2. The integral becomes ∫ (r / (4 - r^2)) dr = -1/2 ∫ (1/u) du = -1/2 ln|u| + C = -1/2 ln|4 - r^2| + C. Evaluating from 0 to 2, we get -1/2 [ln(4 - 4) - ln(4 - 0)] = -1/2 [ln(0) - ln(4)] = +∞ because ln(0) tends to -∞ and the negative sign makes the integral diverge positively. This shows the area integral diverges to infinity due to the singularity at r=2. The other options involve expressions dependent on x and y, which cannot represent a total scalar area. Therefore, the only mathematically consistent and correct answer is A) +∞.
