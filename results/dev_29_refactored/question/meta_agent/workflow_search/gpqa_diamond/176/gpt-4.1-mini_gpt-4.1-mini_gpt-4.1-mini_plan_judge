Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_176
proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are equal (by Wien's law). Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Given that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (1.5)² = 2.25. The mass ratio and radial velocities do not affect the intrinsic luminosity ratio in this context. Among the given options (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), 2.25 is the exact and most appropriate choice.
