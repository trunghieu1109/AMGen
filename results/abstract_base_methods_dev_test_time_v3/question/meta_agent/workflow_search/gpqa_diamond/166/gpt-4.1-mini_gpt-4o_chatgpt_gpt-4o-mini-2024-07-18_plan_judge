proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, the calculated non-Gaussianity value del_b was determined to be a small positive value, specifically 0.25. The provided choices are 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25. Among these, the value 0.25 is the closest match to the calculated del_b. Therefore, the correct alphabet choice corresponding to the closest value is D).

proposed answer: The calculated non-Gaussianity measure del_b was determined to be 0 in the previous sub-task. The provided choices are 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25. Among these, the value 0 exactly matches the calculated non-Gaussianity measure. This indicates that the Schrödinger cat state, with the given parameters phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, has no non-Gaussianity when compared to its reference Gaussian state. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that corresponds to 0, which is choice B).

proposed answer: All agents have calculated the non-Gaussianity measure del_b to be 0.25. This value matches exactly with one of the provided choices, which is 0.25. The reasoning is consistent across all agents, where the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau is assumed to be zero, and the entropy of the non-Gaussian state rho is a small positive value. This leads to a small positive value for del_b, which aligns with the choice 0.25. The other options, such as 2.48 and 1.38, are significantly larger and do not fit the expected small entropy difference for such quantum states. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the calculated del_b is 0.25, corresponding to choice D).
