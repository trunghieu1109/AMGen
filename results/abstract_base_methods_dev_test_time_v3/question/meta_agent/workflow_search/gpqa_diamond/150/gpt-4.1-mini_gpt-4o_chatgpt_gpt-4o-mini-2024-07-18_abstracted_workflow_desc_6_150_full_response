The magnitude of the vector is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components: sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized vector is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).; answer - The normalized state vector is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the eigenvalues of the matrix operator P, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ are the eigenvalues. The matrix P is given by:\n\nP = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].\n\nFirst, we set up the matrix P - λI:\n\nP - λI = [[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]].\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is calculated as follows:\n\ndet(P - λI) = -λ(-λ * -λ - (1/sqrt(2))^2) - 1/sqrt(2)(1/sqrt(2) * -λ - 0) + 0\n= -λ(λ^2 - 1/2) + λ/2\n= -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2\n= -λ^3 + λ.\n\nSetting this equal to zero gives the characteristic equation:\n\n-λ^3 + λ = 0\nλ(-λ^2 + 1) = 0.\n\nThis gives us the eigenvalues λ = 0 and λ = ±1.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. For λ = 0, we solve (P - 0I)x = 0:\n\n[[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]] * [x1, x2, x3] = [0, 0, 0].\n\nThis gives us the system of equations:\n\n1/sqrt(2) * x2 = 0,\nx1/sqrt(2) + x3/sqrt(2) = 0,\n1/sqrt(2) * x2 = 0.\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we have x2 = 0. From the second equation, we have x1 + x3 = 0, so x3 = -x1.\n\nThus, the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0 is [x1, 0, -x1]. To normalize this eigenvector, we set x1 = 1, giving [1, 0, -1]. The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], which is already normalized.; answer - [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To project the normalized state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, we use the formula for the projection of a vector v onto a vector u: proj_u(v) = (v . u) / (u . u) * u. The normalized state vector from Sub-task 1 is v = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)). The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 from Sub-task 2 is u = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). First, we calculate the dot product v . u: v . u = (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) = -1/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) + 0 - 1/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) = -2/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)). Next, we calculate u . u: u . u = (1/sqrt(2))^2 + 0^2 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1. The projection is then: proj_u(v) = (-2/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2))) / 1 * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) = (-2/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2))) * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) = (-2/(sqrt(12))) * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) = (-2/sqrt(12)) * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). Simplifying, we have: proj_u(v) = (-2/sqrt(12)) * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) = (-sqrt(2/3)) * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So, ||v|| = sqrt((-1/sqrt(3))^2 + 0^2 + (1/sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(1/3 + 0 + 1/3) = sqrt(2/3).

Since the problem only asks for the probability of the observable yielding 0, and we have not computed probabilities for other eigenvalues, we cannot directly verify that the sum of probabilities for all eigenvalues is 1.
