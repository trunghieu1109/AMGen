Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the two neutrino-like particles V can carry away varying amounts of energy, allowing for a range of possible energies for the E particles. In the variant decay, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. The presence of a single massless particle M changes the kinematics because now there is only one additional particle to share the energy and momentum with the E particles. However, the energy spectrum of the E particles can still be continuous because the massless particle M can carry away varying amounts of energy, similar to how the neutrinos did in the original decay. The endpoint of the spectrum is determined by the maximum energy the E particles can have, which occurs when the massless particle M carries away the least energy. Since M is massless, it can carry away very little energy, potentially increasing the endpoint compared to the original decay. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. This aligns with choice C) 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.'
