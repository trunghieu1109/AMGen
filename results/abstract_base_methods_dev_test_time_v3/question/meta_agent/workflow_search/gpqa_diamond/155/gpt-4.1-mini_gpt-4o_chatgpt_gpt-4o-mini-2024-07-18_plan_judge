Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The combined product mixture from the reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers: one meso diol and a pair of enantiomeric diols. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, the enantiomers will not be resolved and will co-elute, resulting in two peaks: one for the meso diol and one for the enantiomeric pair. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomers will be separated due to their different interactions with the chiral stationary phase, leading to three distinct peaks: one peak for the meso diol and one peak for each of the enantiomers. Therefore, the correct answer choice that matches the observed number of peaks is '2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC'.
