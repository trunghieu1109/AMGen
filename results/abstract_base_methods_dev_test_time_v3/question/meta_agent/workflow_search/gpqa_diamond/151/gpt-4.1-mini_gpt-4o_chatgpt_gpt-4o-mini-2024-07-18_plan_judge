Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: In the context of active chromatin during the mating response in yeast, particularly in the formation of the shmoo, we expect to find protein complexes involved in transcriptional activation. The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is essential for transcription initiation and would be present in active chromatin. Enhancer protein complexes also play a role in transcriptional regulation and are likely to be found. The nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin and present in all chromatin, although histones may be modified or displaced during activation. The pre-replication complex, however, is specifically associated with DNA replication initiation, not transcription, and would not typically be found in active transcriptional regions. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex are least likely to be recovered by ChIP-MS from active chromatin in the shmoo.
