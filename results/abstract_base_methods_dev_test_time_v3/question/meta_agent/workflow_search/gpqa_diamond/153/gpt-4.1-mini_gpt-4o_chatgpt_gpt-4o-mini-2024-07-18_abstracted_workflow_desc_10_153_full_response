This suggests the presence of a chlorine atom in the compound, as chlorine has two common isotopes: 35Cl and 37Cl. The natural abundance of 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%, which matches the observed isotopic pattern.

The signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, which is consistent with the IR data suggesting a carboxylic acid group. The singlet indicates that this proton is not coupled to any other protons, which is typical for the acidic proton in a carboxylic acid. The signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet. This pattern is consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring, where the protons are split by adjacent protons. The presence of chlorine, as indicated by the mass spectrometry data, suggests a chlorinated aromatic carboxylic acid. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this description, as it has a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. However, the limitation is that the analysis assumes the para-substitution pattern without considering other possible substitution patterns that could also fit the data.

However, one limitation is the assumption of para-substitution based solely on the NMR data, which could potentially match other substitution patterns if not carefully analyzed. Additionally, the presence of a chlorine atom is inferred from the isotopic pattern, but other halogens or elements could potentially give similar patterns, though less likely. The IR data strongly suggests a carboxylic acid, but without additional data, other functional groups with similar IR peaks might be considered.
