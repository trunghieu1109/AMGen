proposed answer: The design of a real-time PCR assay for rapid and accurate detection of a retrovirus should be based on the precise genetic information of the virus. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, which are reverse transcribed into cDNA. By performing cDNA sequencing, we can obtain the exact nucleotide sequence of the viral genome. This information is crucial for designing specific primers and probes that target unique regions of the viral genome. Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a powerful technique for detecting specific DNA sequences, and it requires precise primer and probe design to ensure specificity and sensitivity. The use of a probe in real-time PCR increases the assay's specificity and sensitivity by allowing direct detection of the amplified product as it accumulates. This approach ensures that the assay is both rapid and accurate, leveraging the specific sequence information obtained from cDNA sequencing. Therefore, the most logical choice is to first perform cDNA sequencing and then develop a real-time PCR kit, as outlined in choice D.
