In the far field region, this setup produces a diffraction pattern of intensity maxima and minima. Since the aperture is approximated as a circle with radius a, we can apply the theory of circular aperture diffraction. The angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by the formula for a circular aperture: sin(theta) = m * \\lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture and m is the order of the minimum. For the first minimum (m=1), sin(theta) = \\lambda / D. Since D = 2a (diameter of the circle), and using the small angle approximation sin(theta) ≈ theta, the angular position of the first minimum is theta = \\lambda / (2a). The angular distance between the first two minima is then twice this value, which is 2 * \\lambda / (2a) = \\lambda / a.

This setup leads to a diffraction pattern in the far field, characterized by intensity maxima and minima. The small angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ) is applicable since the angles involved are small.

The formula θ_n = j_1,n·λ/(2πa) is derived from the far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, where j_1,n are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁. The limitation of this derivation is that it assumes the aperture is perfectly circular and the angles are small, allowing the use of the small angle approximation tan θ ≈ θ.
