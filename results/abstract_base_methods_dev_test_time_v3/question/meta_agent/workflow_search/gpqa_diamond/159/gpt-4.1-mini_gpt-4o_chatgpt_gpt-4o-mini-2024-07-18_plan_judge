proposed answer: The problem involves a diffraction pattern created by an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with N approaching infinity, which effectively becomes a circular aperture. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk, and the angular positions of the minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J_1. The first minimum occurs at an angle θ_1 = 1.22 λ / a. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. In the context of circular aperture diffraction, the first minimum is often the primary focus, and the given choices suggest that the angular position of the first minimum is what is being sought. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima, considering the small angle approximation and the context of the choices, is best represented by the first minimum, which is 1.22 λ / a. Thus, the correct choice is A) 1.220 λ / a.

proposed answer: The computed angular distance Δθ between the first two minima is 0.506 λ / a, as derived from the positions of the minima using the zeros of the Bessel function for a circular aperture. This matches choice D) 0.506 λ / a. The numeric sanity check involves comparing this value to an expected value of approximately 0.5076 λ/a. The computed value of 0.506 λ / a is very close to 0.5076 λ/a, differing by only 0.0016 λ/a, which is a small difference and within a reasonable range of approximation given the assumptions and approximations used in the problem (such as the small angle approximation). Therefore, the computed value is consistent with the expected value, and choice D) is the correct answer.
