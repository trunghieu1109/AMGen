This can cause issues if the formats are not properly converted or interpreted. 2) The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion arises when some datasets or tools include the 'chr' prefix in chromosome names (e.g., 'chr1') while others do not (e.g., '1'). This can lead to mismatches and errors in data processing. 3) Reference assembly mismatch occurs when different datasets or tools use different versions of the reference genome assembly, leading to discrepancies in genomic coordinates and annotations. This can cause significant errors if not properly accounted for. 4) Incorrect ID conversion involves errors in converting between different types of identifiers (e.g., gene symbols, Ensembl IDs, etc.), which can lead to incorrect data mapping and analysis.

These errors are often subtle and difficult to detect, especially in large-scale analyses. 1) Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors when data is not properly converted or interpreted, which is a common issue in bioinformatics as tools and datasets often use different formats. 2) The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion is a frequent source of errors, particularly when integrating data from different sources, as some datasets include the 'chr' prefix in chromosome names while others do not. 3) Reference assembly mismatch is a significant issue because different datasets may use different versions of the reference genome, leading to discrepancies in genomic coordinates and annotations. This is particularly problematic in comparative studies or when integrating data from different sources. 4) Incorrect ID conversion can lead to errors in data mapping and analysis, as converting between different types of identifiers (e.g., gene symbols, Ensembl IDs) is prone to mistakes if not carefully managed. Literature and expert knowledge confirm that these issues are common and impactful, as they can lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly addressed. Case studies and surveys often highlight these as key challenges in genomics data analysis, emphasizing their frequency and the difficulty in detecting the resulting errors.

These errors can propagate through analyses, leading to incorrect results. 3) Reference assembly mismatch is a significant source of errors because using the wrong reference can lead to incorrect genomic coordinates, which affects downstream analyses and is not easy to detect without careful validation. 4) Incorrect ID conversion is a common issue in genomics, as incorrect mappings between different identifier systems can lead to misinterpretation of results, and these errors are often silent unless cross-checked with known datasets.

This issue requires careful validation against the correct reference version. 4) Incorrect ID conversion is also a subtle issue, as incorrect mappings can go unnoticed if the conversion process is not meticulously validated. Overall, while all issues can lead to hard-to-detect errors, the combination of 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are most commonly associated with silent errors.
