The original vector was (3i/5, 4/5), and its conjugate transpose is (-3i/5, 4/5). In Sub-task 5b, the inner product was calculated by multiplying the conjugate transpose vector (-3i/5, 4/5) with the intermediate vector (-4i/5, -3/5). The calculations were: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = 12i^2/25 = -12/25, and (4/5) * (-3/5) = -12/25. Adding these gives -24/25. In Sub-task 5c, the inner product result -24/25 was multiplied by hbar/2 to get the expectation value: (-24/25) * (hbar/2) = -12hbar/25. All calculations were correctly handled, including the complex number multiplications and the use of i^2 = -1.
