Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: All agents agree that the total mass of system_1 is proportional to 3, and the total mass of system_2 is proportional to 5. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is the ratio of their total masses, which is 3/5 = 0.6. This corresponds to choice C). Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.6 times as massive as system_2.

proposed answer: The mass ratio calculation uses the formula M_total ∝ P × (K1 + K2)^3, which is derived from Kepler's third law. For system_1, P1 = 2 years and (K11 + K12) = 15 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year and (K21 + K22) = 25 km/s. The mass ratio is [P1 × (K11 + K12)^3] / [P2 × (K21 + K22)^3] = [2 × 15^3] / [1 × 25^3] = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. This indicates system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.4. The calculation assumes circular orbits and equal inclinations, which may not be true, but it provides a reasonable estimate given the data. Therefore, the correct choice is A) ~ 0.4.
