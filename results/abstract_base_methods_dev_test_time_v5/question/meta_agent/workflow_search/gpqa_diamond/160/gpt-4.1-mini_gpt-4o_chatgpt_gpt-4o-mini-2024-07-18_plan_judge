Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy.

Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature.

proposed answer: In the scenario described, λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum without the influence of an electron beam. When the electron beam is introduced, the mean free path λ2 is determined by the scattering of electrons with the gas molecules. Electrons, due to their smaller size and higher energy, typically have a longer mean free path compared to gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 is expected to be greater than λ1. The choice D) 'λ2 >= 1.22*λ1' aligns with this understanding, as it suggests that the mean free path of electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than that of the gas molecules (λ1). This conclusion is consistent with the principles of electron scattering and the effects of high-energy electron beams in ultra-high vacuum environments.

proposed answer: Based on the analysis in Sub-task 4, the mean free path λ2 is determined by electron-gas scattering, which typically results in a shorter mean free path compared to the molecular collision mean free path λ1. This is because the scattering cross-section for electrons is generally larger, leading to more frequent interactions. Therefore, λ2 is less than λ1. The choice C) 'λ2 < λ1' aligns with this understanding, as it indicates that the mean free path for electron scattering is shorter than that for molecular collisions.
