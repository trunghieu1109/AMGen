The mean free path of gas molecules is influenced by pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. However, when electrons are involved, the mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is determined by their scattering cross-section with gas molecules, which is generally different from the molecular collision cross-section. Since electrons typically have a larger scattering cross-section, λ2 is expected to be less than λ1. This aligns with the explanation provided in the sub-task, where λ2 is stated to be less than λ1. Therefore, the correct choice is C) λ2 < λ1.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ZnkP, calculating mean free path λ1 numerically, thinking: The mean free path λ1 is calculated using the formula λ = k_B·T / (√2·π·d_gas²·p). For ultra-high vacuum conditions, the pressure is extremely low, which results in a large mean free path. When the electron beam is initiated, the mean free path λ2, which is based on electron scattering, is different from λ1. The mean free path for electrons (λ2) is affected by the scattering cross-section of electrons with gas molecules. Typically, this scattering cross-section is larger than the molecular collision cross-section, meaning electrons are more likely to scatter than gas molecules are to collide. Therefore, λ2 is likely to be less than λ1, as electrons have a shorter mean free path due to frequent scattering events.

Typically, the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the molecular collision cross-section, leading to more frequent scattering events for electrons. This results in a shorter mean free path for electrons compared to gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 is likely to be less than λ1. The factor 1.22 does not directly apply here because it typically relates to changes in conditions like pressure or temperature, not the intrinsic difference between electron and gas molecule interactions.

The electron-gas scattering cross-section is typically larger, leading to a shorter mean free path for electrons compared to gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 should be less than λ1. The factor 1.22 could be related to a correction or scaling factor in the context of electron scattering, but it is unlikely that λ2 would exceed λ1 by this factor given the nature of electron scattering.
