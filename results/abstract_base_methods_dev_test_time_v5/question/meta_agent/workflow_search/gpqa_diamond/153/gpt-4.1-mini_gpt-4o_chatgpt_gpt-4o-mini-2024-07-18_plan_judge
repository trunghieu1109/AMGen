Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data indicates the presence of a chlorine atom due to the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the isotope pattern with a peak at m/z = 158. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is characteristic of O-H stretching, and a sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of C=O stretching, both consistent with a carboxylic acid group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, typical for a carboxylic acid proton, and doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring. Among the given choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the spectral data: it has a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring, which explains the NMR data. The other options either lack the correct substitution pattern or functional groups. For example, 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have different NMR splitting patterns due to ortho substitution, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and phenyl chloroformate do not have the necessary carboxylic acid group or the correct NMR pattern. Therefore, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most consistent with the spectral data provided.
