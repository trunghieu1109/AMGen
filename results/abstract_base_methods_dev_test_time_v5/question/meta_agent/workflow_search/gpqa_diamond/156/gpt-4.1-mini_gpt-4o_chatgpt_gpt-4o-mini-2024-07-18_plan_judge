Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_156
proposed answer: The development and validation of the real-time PCR molecular diagnostic kit should focus on ensuring both sensitivity and specificity. The steps outlined by the debate agents involve designing specific primers and probes based on the viral cDNA sequence, optimizing PCR conditions, and conducting thorough validation with clinical samples. These steps ensure that the kit can accurately detect the virus in real-world settings. The consensus among the agents is that choice D) is the best approach, as it involves using cDNA sequencing followed by real-time PCR, which is a well-established method for rapid and accurate viral detection. This approach aligns with the need for a specific and sensitive diagnostic tool, making it the most suitable choice for the task.
