The stereochemistry of the epoxide will be such that the oxygen is added syn to the double bond, resulting in a single epoxide product. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides typically occurs with inversion of configuration at the more substituted carbon, leading to a trans-diol.

Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol, which is achiral. Reaction 2 produces a trans-1,2-diol, which has two chiral centers and is not meso, resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the combined product mixture will contain one achiral meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. In total, there are 3 unique stereoisomers: the meso diol and the two enantiomers of the trans-1,2-diol. On a standard achiral HPLC column, the meso diol and the pair of enantiomers will result in 2 peaks, since enantiomers are not resolved.

Thus, the combined product mixture consists of three unique stereoisomers: one meso diol and a pair of enantiomers from the trans-1,2-diol. On a standard HPLC column, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound will appear as one peak, and the racemic mixture will appear as a second peak, resulting in 2 peaks.

The combined product mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso diol (achiral) and two enantiomers of the trans-1,2-diol (chiral). In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical interactions and thus co-elute as a single peak. Therefore, the meso diol will show up as one peak and the pair of enantiomers will show up as another peak. Thus, we will observe 2 distinct peaks in the standard HPLC.; answer: 2 peaks\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent BjNk, predicting standard HPLC peaks, thinking: In a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, compounds are separated based on their polarity and not their chirality. In the combined product mixture, we have three stereoisomers: one meso diol and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and distinct from the chiral trans-1,2-diol enantiomers. However, the enantiomers are not distinguishable on an achiral column since they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the standard HPLC will show two distinct peaks: one for the meso diol and one for the pair of enantiomers, which co-elute.

On a chiral HPLC column, chiral compounds can be separated based on their interactions with the chiral stationary phase. The meso compound, being achiral, will not interact with the chiral stationary phase in a way that separates it into multiple peaks, so it will appear as a single peak. The pair of enantiomers, however, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in their separation into two distinct peaks.
