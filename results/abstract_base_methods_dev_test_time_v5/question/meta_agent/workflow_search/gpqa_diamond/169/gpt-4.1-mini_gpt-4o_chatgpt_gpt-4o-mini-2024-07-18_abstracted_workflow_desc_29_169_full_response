To normalize it, we need to calculate its norm and then divide each component by the norm. The norm of a vector (a, b) is given by sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2). Here, a = 3i and b = 4. The magnitude of 3i is |3i| = 3, and the magnitude of 4 is |4| = 4. So, the norm is sqrt((3)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. To normalize, we divide each component by 5: (3i/5, 4/5).; answer - (3i/5, 4/5)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The normalized spin state from Sub-task 1 is (3i/5, 4/5). To express this as a column vector suitable for matrix operations, we write it as a 2x1 column vector with complex components. In matrix notation, this is expressed as: \n\\begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\\\ 4/5 \\end{pmatrix}. This preserves the complex components and is in the correct form for matrix operations.; answer - \\begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\\\ 4/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The spin operator matrix sigma_y is given in the problem statement in LaTeX format as \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}. This corresponds to the 2x2 matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]] in standard matrix notation. This matrix is used to calculate the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for a given spin state.; answer - [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the intermediate vector, we need to perform the matrix multiplication of the sigma_y matrix with the normalized spin state vector. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and the normalized spin state vector is \\begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\\\ 4/5 \\end{pmatrix}. We perform the multiplication as follows: For the first component of the resulting vector, we calculate (0 * 3i/5) + (-i * 4/5) = -i * 4/5 = -4i/5. For the second component, we calculate (i * 3i/5) + (0 * 4/5) = i^2 * 3/5 = -3/5.

The conjugate of this component is -3i/5. The first component of the intermediate vector is -4i/5. We compute the product of the conjugate of the first component of the normalized spin state vector with the first component of the intermediate vector as follows: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (3i * 4i) / 25 = (12i^2) / 25. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes (12 * -1) / 25 = -12/25.

Its complex conjugate is also 4/5 since it is a real number. The second component of the intermediate vector is -3/5.

To find the inner product <psi|sigma_y|psi>, we sum these results: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25. This result is a real number, which is expected for an observable such as the expectation value of a spin component.

To find the expectation value of S_y, we multiply this result by (hbar/2): (-24/25) * (hbar/2) = -12*hbar/25. This value lies within the physical bounds of [-hbar/2, +hbar/2] because -12*hbar/25 is approximately -0.48*hbar, which is within the range of -0.5*hbar to 0.5*hbar.
