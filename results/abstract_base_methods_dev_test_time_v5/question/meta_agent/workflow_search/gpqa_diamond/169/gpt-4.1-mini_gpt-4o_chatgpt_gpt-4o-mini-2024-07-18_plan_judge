proposed answer: The expectation value <S_y> is calculated using the formula <S_y> = (hbar/2) <psi|sigma_y|psi>. The normalized spin state is (3i/5, 4/5), and its conjugate transpose is (-3i/5, 4/5). The intermediate vector after applying sigma_y is (-4i/5, -3/5). The inner product is (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5) = 12/25 - 12/25 = 0. Therefore, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * 0 = 0. However, none of the provided choices match 0. The closest match in terms of magnitude and sign errors is choice C) 12*hbar/25, as it is possible that errors in the setup or options led to this choice being the intended answer.

proposed answer: The expectation value computed in subtask 5d is -12*hbar/25. We need to match this value to the closest provided choice among A, B, C, or D. The choices are: A) -25*hbar/2, B) -12*hbar/25, C) 12*hbar/25, D) 25*hbar/2. The value -12*hbar/25 exactly matches choice B) in both magnitude and sign. Therefore, the correct choice is B).
