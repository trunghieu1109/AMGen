The cube roots of -1 are λ = -1, and λ = e^(i2π/3), e^(-i2π/3), which are complex. However, to find the eigenvalue 0, we can check if 0 is an eigenvalue by substituting it into the characteristic equation directly. If λ = 0 is an eigenvalue, then det(P) = 0.

Therefore, there is no eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to imply that there should be a way to express the probability of measuring the observable yielding 0, which suggests that we need to consider the projection onto the subspace associated with the eigenvalue 0. Since we found no eigenvalue 0, this might be a trick question or an error in the problem setup.\n\nTherefore, based on the given choices and the fact that we cannot find an eigenvalue 0, the probability might be related to the fact that the state vector itself is orthogonal to the subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, hence the probability would be 0.
