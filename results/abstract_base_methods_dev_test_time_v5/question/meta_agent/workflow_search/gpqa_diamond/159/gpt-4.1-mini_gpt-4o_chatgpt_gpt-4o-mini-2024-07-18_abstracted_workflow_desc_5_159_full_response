The intensity I(θ) is proportional to [2J_1(k a θ)/(k a θ)]^2, where J_1 is the first-order Bessel function, k = 2π/λ is the wave number, and θ is the diffraction angle. The first minimum in the Airy pattern occurs where the argument of J_1 is approximately 3.8317, which corresponds to the first zero of the Bessel function J_1. In terms of k, a, and θ, this condition is k a θ = 3.8317. Therefore, θ = 3.8317 / (k a) = 3.8317 λ / (2π a). The second minimum occurs at the next zero of J_1, which is approximately 7.0156. Thus, the second minimum is at θ = 7.0156 / (k a) = 7.0156 λ / (2π a). The angular distance between the first two minima is then Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ / (2π a) = 3.1839 λ / (2π a).
