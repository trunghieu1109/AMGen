Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_151
proposed answer: In the context of shmoo formation in yeast, active chromatin regions are primarily involved in transcriptional regulation. The pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complexes are directly involved in transcriptional activation and are expected to be enriched in active chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin and would be present in all chromatin, regardless of its activity state. The pre-replication complex, on the other hand, is involved in DNA replication and not directly in transcriptional regulation, which is the primary activity during shmoo formation. Consequently, proteins from the pre-replication complex are the least likely to be observed in the active chromatin proteome of the shmoo isolated by ChIP-MS.
