Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_157
proposed answer: The dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain suggests that the mutant protein forms non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. This is characteristic of dominant-negative mutations, where the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. The mutant protein's interference results in non-functional dimers, thus causing a loss of function. Among the provided choices, 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' best describes the expected outcome of such a mutation, as the mutant protein aggregates with the wild-type protein, leading to a non-functional complex. All debate agents agree that this choice aligns with the predicted molecular phenotype from Sub-task 4.
