Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The calculated non-Gaussianity value del_b was determined to be 1.38 by the Final Decision Agent cMqF. The provided choices are 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25. The choice that matches the calculated value of 1.38 is C) 1.38. Therefore, the correct alphabet choice corresponding to the closest value is C).
