To express this in polar coordinates, we use the substitutions x = r cos(theta) and y = r sin(theta). In polar coordinates, dx = dr cos(theta) - r sin(theta) dtheta and dy = dr sin(theta) + r cos(theta) dtheta. The expression dx^2 + dy^2 becomes (dr^2 + r^2 dtheta^2) in polar coordinates, which is a standard result. The denominator 4 - x^2 - y^2 becomes 4 - r^2. Therefore, the metric in polar coordinates becomes ds^2 = (32 / (4 - r^2))(dr^2 + r^2 dtheta^2). The area element in polar coordinates is given by the integrand sqrt(g) dr dtheta, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a metric of the form ds^2 = A dr^2 + B dtheta^2, the determinant is AB. Here, A = 32/(4-r^2) and B = 32r^2/(4-r^2), so the determinant g = 32^2 r^2 / (4-r^2)^2. The area element is thus sqrt(32^2 r^2 / (4-r^2)^2) dr dtheta = (32r / (4-r^2)) dr dtheta. To find the area, we integrate this area element over the domain 0 <= r < 2, 0 <= theta < 2pi.

This metric is now expressed in polar coordinates, which simplifies the calculation of the area. The area element in polar coordinates is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, which in this case is sqrt(32 / (4 - r^2)) * r dr dtheta. To find the area of the pseudosphere, we integrate this area element over the domain 0 <= r < 2 and 0 <= theta < 2pi.

To express this in polar coordinates, we use the substitutions x = r cos(theta) and y = r sin(theta). In polar coordinates, dx = dr cos(theta) - r sin(theta) dtheta and dy = dr sin(theta) + r cos(theta) dtheta. The expression dx^2 + dy^2 becomes (dr^2 + r^2 dtheta^2) in polar coordinates, which is a standard result. The denominator 4 - x^2 - y^2 becomes 4 - r^2.
