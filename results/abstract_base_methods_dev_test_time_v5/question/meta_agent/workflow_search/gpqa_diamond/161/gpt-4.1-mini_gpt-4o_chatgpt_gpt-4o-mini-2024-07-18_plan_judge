Question: Example(question='Consider the following metric:\n\nds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)\n\nWhat is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?\n\nPS: for the maths use a LaTeX editor.', choice1='+\\infty', choice2='4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)', choice3='0', choice4='4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_29_161
proposed answer: The integration result from Sub-task 4 indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite due to the singularity at r = 2, which causes the integral to diverge. This aligns with choice A) +∞, which correctly reflects the infinite nature of the pseudosphere's area. The other choices involve finite expressions or zero, which do not match the result of the integration. Therefore, the correct answer is A) +∞.
