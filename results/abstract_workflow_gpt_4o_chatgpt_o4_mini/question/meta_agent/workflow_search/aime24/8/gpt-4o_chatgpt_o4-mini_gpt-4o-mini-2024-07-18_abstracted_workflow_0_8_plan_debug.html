    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alices play..

### Sub-task 5: Verify the correctness of the identified positions. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 6ZUz:
We verify the P‐position pattern by induction on n. We check small n and then show the inductive step: if n≡0 or 2 mod 5 both moves lead to N‐positions, and if n≡1,3,4 mod 5 there is a move to a P‐position.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent vc7b:
To verify that the P-positions (losing for the player to move) are exactly those n with n≡0 or 2 mod 5, we use induction on n. Base cases for n=0,1,2,3,4 match: 0 and 2 are P; 1,3,4 are N. Assume the claim holds for all m&lt;n. If n≡0 or 2 mod 5, then n−1≡4 or 1 and n−4≡1 or 3 mod 5, both of which are N by hypothesis, so n has no move to a P-position and is itself P. If n≡1,3,4 mod 5, then one of n−1 or n−4 is ≡0 or 2 mod 5 (a P-position), so n is N. This completes the induction.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 6ZUz:
We prove by induction that the losing positions (P‐positions) are exactly those n with n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).

Base cases (n=0,…,4):
• n=0: no tokens left ⇒ P.
• n=1: can remove 1 ⇒ moves to n=0 (P) ⇒ N.
• n=2: can remove 1⇒n=1(N) or 2⇒n=0(P), but removing 2 is not allowed; only 1 or 4, so both moves (only 1) go to N ⇒ P.
• n=3: remove 1⇒2(P) ⇒ N.
• n=4: remove 4⇒0(P) ⇒ N.
Thus among 0–4 exactly n≡0 or 2 mod 5 are P.

Inductive step: Assume all m&lt;n satisfy “m is P iff m≡0 or 2 mod 5.”
– If n≡0 or 2 mod 5 then n−1≡4 or 1 and n−4≡1 or 3 mod 5; by IH both are N, so no move from n lands on a P ⇒ n is P.
– If n≡1,3,4 mod 5 then either n−1 or n−4 is ≡0 or 2 mod 5, hence a P-position is reachable ⇒ n is N.

Therefore by induction the P-positions are exactly those with n≡0 or 2 (mod 5), confirming the classification.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent vc7b:
By induction on n: Base (n=0…4) matches. Inductive step shows n≡0 or 2 mod 5 ⇒ both n−1 and n−4 are N ⇒ n is P; and n≡1,3,4 mod 5 ⇒ one of n−1,n−4 is P ⇒ n is N. Hence the P-positions are exactly those with n≡0 or 2 mod 5.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on correctness.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The induction argument correctly establishes that positions with n≡0 or 2 mod 5 are P-positions: base cases n=0…4 match, and the inductive step shows that if n≡0 or2 mod 5 both moves lead to N-positions, and if n≡1,3,4 mod 5 there is a move to a P-position. Thus the classification is sound.

Answer:The identified positions (P-positions are exactly those with n≡0 or 2 mod 5) are correct.</pre>
