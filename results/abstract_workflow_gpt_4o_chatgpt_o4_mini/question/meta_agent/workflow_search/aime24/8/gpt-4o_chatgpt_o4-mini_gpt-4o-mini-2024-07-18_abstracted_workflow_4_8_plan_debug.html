    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alices play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Count the number of positions n less than or equal to 2024 that are losing positions for Alice, which are winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent nPdR:
A position is a P-position (Bob wins) iff n≡0 or 2 mod 5. For n≤2024 there are ⌊2024/5⌋=404 multiples of 5 and ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405 values ≡2 mod 5, totalling 404+405=809.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 2PnY:
Positions where Bob wins are exactly those with n mod 5 = 0 or 2. There are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5, and floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, giving 404+405 = 809.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent nPdR:
809

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 2PnY:
809

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the count of winning positions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
