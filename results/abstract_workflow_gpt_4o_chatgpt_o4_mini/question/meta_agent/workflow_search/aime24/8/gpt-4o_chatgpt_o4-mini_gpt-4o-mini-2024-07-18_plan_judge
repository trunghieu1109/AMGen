Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The induction argument correctly establishes that positions with n≡0 or 2 mod 5 are P-positions: base cases n=0…4 match, and the inductive step shows that if n≡0 or2 mod 5 both moves lead to N-positions, and if n≡1,3,4 mod 5 there is a move to a P-position. Thus the classification is sound.

Answer:The identified positions (P-positions are exactly those with n≡0 or 2 mod 5) are correct.
Extracted answer: The identified positions (P-positions are exactly those with n≡0 or 2 mod 5) are correct.
Correct answer: 809

proposed answer: The losing positions (P-positions) are those with n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For n ≤ 2024, there are floor(2024/5) = 404 multiples of 5 and floor((2024−2)/5) + 1 = 405 numbers ≡ 2 mod 5, totaling 404 + 405 = 809.
