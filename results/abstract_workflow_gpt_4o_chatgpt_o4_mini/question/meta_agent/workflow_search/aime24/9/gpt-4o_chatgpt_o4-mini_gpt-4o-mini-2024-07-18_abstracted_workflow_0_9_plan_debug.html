    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize by having at least 2 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SDo9:
For a fixed set of 4 numbers Jen picked, the lottery draws 4 from the remaining 10. She wins if exactly k of her numbers (k=2,3,4) appear. The count for each k is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). Summing: k=2 ➔ 6*15=90; k=3 ➔ 4*6=24; k=4 ➔ 1*1=1. Total = 90+24+1 = 115.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent SDo9:
115

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize by having all 4 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent VvR1:
For the grand prize, the randomly chosen set of 4 numbers must exactly match Jen’s fixed set of 4 numbers. Out of C(10,4)=210 possible draws, only one draw matches her set exactly, so there is exactly 1 way.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent VvR1:
1

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, and express it in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FOnX (yourself):
There is exactly 1 way to match all 4 numbers and 115 ways to match at least 2. Thus the conditional probability is 1/115, and 1 and 115 are relatively prime.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FOnX (yourself):
1/115

### Review probability calculation and ensure m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 3hST:
The conditional probability is correctly computed as (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115, and 1 and 115 are relatively prime.

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, and express it in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FOnX (yourself):
There is exactly 1 way to match all 4 numbers and 115 ways to match at least 2. Thus the conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115, and 1 and 115 are relatively prime.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FOnX (yourself):
1/115

### Review probability calculation and ensure m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent 3hST:
The calculation is correct: there are 1 way to win the grand prize and 115 ways to win any prize, so P(grand prize | prize) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, the fraction is in lowest terms.

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, and express it in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FOnX (yourself):
There is exactly 1 way to match all 4 of Jen’s numbers and 115 ways to match at least 2. Hence the conditional probability is 1/115, which is already in lowest terms.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FOnX (yourself):
1/115

### Review probability calculation and ensure m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent 3hST:
The calculation is correct. There are C(4,2)·C(6,2)+C(4,3)·C(6,1)+C(4,4)·C(6,0)=90+24+1=115 winning draws and 1 grand‐prize draw, so P=1/115 with 1 and 115 relatively prime.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, and express it in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
