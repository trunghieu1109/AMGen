Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

There are C(4,2)·C(6,2)+C(4,3)·C(6,1)+C(4,4)·C(6,0)=90+24+1=115 winning draws and 1 grand‐prize draw, so P=1/115 with 1 and 115 relatively prime.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, and express it in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent R1FV, calculating total combinations, thinking: We need the number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10, which is C(10,4) = 10!/(4!6!) = 210.; answer: 210\nCoT-SC agent VlEq, calculating prize-winning ways, thinking: We fix Jen’s chosen 4 numbers.
