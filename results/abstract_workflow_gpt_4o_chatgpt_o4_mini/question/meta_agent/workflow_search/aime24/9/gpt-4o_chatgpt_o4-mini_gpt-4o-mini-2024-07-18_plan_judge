Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_9
proposed answer: There is exactly 1 way to match all 4 of Jenâ€™s numbers and 115 ways to match at least 2 of her numbers. Thus the conditional probability is 1/115, and 1 and 115 are relatively prime.

Answer:1/115
Extracted answer: 1/115
Correct answer: 116
