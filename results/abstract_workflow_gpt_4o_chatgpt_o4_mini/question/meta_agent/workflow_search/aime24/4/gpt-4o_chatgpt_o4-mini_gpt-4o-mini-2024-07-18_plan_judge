Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_4
proposed answer: We have p=17. Solutions mod 17 to m^4≡−1 are m≡2,8,9,15. Each lifts uniquely to a solution mod 17^2=289 by setting m=a+17k and solving (a^4+1)+68a^3k≡0 mod 289, i.e. k≡−(a^4+1)/17·(4a^3)^{−1} mod17. This yields lifts 155, 110, 179, and 134 respectively. The smallest positive m is 110.

proposed answer: We know p=17 is the least prime such that n^4+1≡0 mod 17^2 has a solution.  The four roots of x^4≡−1 mod 17 are x≡2,8,9,15.  Each lifts uniquely to a solution mod 289 via Hensel’s lemma.  Solving (n+17k)^4+1≡0 mod 289 for each n yields the four lifts m=155,110,179,134.  The smallest positive of these is 110.
