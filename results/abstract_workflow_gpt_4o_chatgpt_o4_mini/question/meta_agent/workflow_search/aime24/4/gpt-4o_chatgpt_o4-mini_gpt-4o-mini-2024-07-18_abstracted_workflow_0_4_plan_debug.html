    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Given the prime p found in stage 1, determine the condition under which m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YI7i:
We have p=17. By Hensel’s lemma, a solution m mod 17 with m^4≡−1 (mod 17) and f′(m)=4m^3≢0 (mod 17) (automatic since m≢0) lifts uniquely to a solution mod 17^2. Thus the necessary and sufficient condition for 17^2|m^4+1 is m^4≡−1 (mod 17).

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YI7i:
m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 if and only if m^4≡−1 (mod 17); equivalently m≡2, 8, 9, or 15 (mod 17), each lifting uniquely to a solution modulo 289.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by the p^2 found in stage 1.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have p=17. Solutions mod 17 to m^4≡−1 are m≡2,8,9,15. Each lifts uniquely to a solution mod 17^2=289 by setting m=a+17k and solving (a^4+1)+68a^3k≡0 mod 289, i.e. k≡−(a^4+1)/17·(4a^3)^{−1} mod17. This yields lifts 155, 110, 179, and 134 respectively. The smallest positive m is 110.
