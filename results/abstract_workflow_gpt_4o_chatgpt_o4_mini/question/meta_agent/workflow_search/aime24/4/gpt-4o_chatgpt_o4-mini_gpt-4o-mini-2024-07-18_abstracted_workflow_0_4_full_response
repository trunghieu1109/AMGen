In particular −1 must be a biquadratic residue mod p, forcing p≡1 (mod 4).; answer: n^4+1 is divisible by p^2 precisely when n^4≡−1 (mod p^2), which in turn requires that −1 be a fourth‐power residue modulo p (hence p≡1 mod 4).\nCoT-SC agent McvG, finding least prime p, thinking: We seek the smallest prime p such that there exists n with n^4≡−1 mod p^2.  Checking p=2,5 fails.  For p=13, n^4≡12 mod13 has no solution.  For p=17, 2^4=16≡−1 mod17 and the derivative 4·2^3≡15≠0 mod17 allows a Hensel lift to mod289.  Hence p=17 is minimal.; answer: 17\nCoT-SC agent nMEL, finding least prime p, thinking: We need p^2∣n^4+1 ⇒ n^4≡−1 mod\u2009p^2, so −1 must be a fourth power mod\u2009p ⇒ p≡1 mod\u20098. The smallest such primes are 5, 13, 17. Testing p=5 and 13 shows no solution mod\u2009p, so they fail. For p=17 there are a^4≡−1 mod\u200917 solutions (a=2,8,9,15) with f′(a)=4a^3≠0 mod\u200917, so each lifts to mod\u200917^2 by Hensel. Thus p=17.; answer: 17\nCoT-SC agent RTSe, finding least prime p, thinking: We seek the smallest prime p for which ∃n with n^4≡−1 (mod p^2).  A necessary and sufficient condition is that −1 be a fourth‐power residue mod p and that f′(n)=4n^3≠0 mod p so Hensel lifting applies.  −1 is a biquadratic residue iff p≡1 mod8.  The least such prime is 17.  Indeed 2^4=16≡−1 mod17 and 4·2^3≠0 mod17, so there is a lift to mod 17^2.; answer: 17\nReflexion CoT agent YI7i, determining condition for m, thinking: We need the condition on m so that m^4+1 is divisible by p^2 with p=17.  By Hensel’s lemma one needs f(m)=m^4+1≡0 (mod17) and f'(m)=4m^3≢0 (mod17).  Solve m^4≡−1 (mod17): one finds m≡±2 or ±8 (i.e. 2,15,8,9) mod17.  Since 4m^3≢0 mod17 at these residues, each lifts uniquely to mod17^2.; answer: m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 if and only if m^4≡−1 (mod17) and 4m^3≢0 (mod17).  Equivalently m≡2,15,8 or 9 (mod17), each of which lifts to a unique solution modulo 289.\nCritic agent bhHm, providing feedback, thinking: The condition given is correct but can be streamlined. Since 4m^3≡0 (mod 17) only when m≡0 (mod 17), and our solutions to m^4≡–1 (mod 17) are all invertible mod 17, the derivative condition is automatically satisfied. Hence the necessary and sufficient condition is simply m^4≡–1 (mod 17). Equivalently, m≡2, 8, 9, or 15 (mod 17), and each of these lifts uniquely to a solution mod 17^2 by Hensel’s lemma.; answer: m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 if and only if m≡2, 8, 9, or 15 (mod 17).\nReflexion CoT agent YI7i, refining condition for m, thinking: By Hensel’s lemma, once m^4≡−1 mod\u200917 and 4m^3≢0 mod\u200917 (which holds since solutions are invertible mod\u200917), there is a unique lift mod\u200917^2. Thus the only condition needed is m^4≡−1 mod\u200917.; answer: m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 if and only if m^4≡−1 (mod\u200917); equivalently m≡2,8,9, or 15 (mod\u200917), each of which lifts uniquely to a solution modulo 289.\nCritic agent bhHm, providing feedback, thinking: The answer correctly notes that the single congruence m^4≡−1 (mod 17) is both necessary and sufficient for divisibility by 17^2, provided one checks Hensel’s lemma hypothesis 4m^3≢0 (mod 17). In fact, since the four solutions mod 17 are invertible, the derivative condition holds automatically.; answer: m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 if and only if m^4≡−1 (mod 17) (equivalently gcd(m,17)=1 and m≡2,8,9, or 15 (mod 17)); each of these four residues lifts uniquely to a solution modulo 289.\nReflexion CoT agent YI7i, refining condition for m, thinking: We have p=17 from sub-task 2.  By Hensel’s lemma, once m^4≡−1 (mod 17) and 4m^3≢0 (mod 17) (automatically true for invertible m), there is a unique lift of m to a solution modulo 17^2.  Hence the sole condition is m^4≡−1 mod 17.; answer: m^4 ≡ −1 (mod 17).  Equivalently, m ≡ 2, 8, 9, or 15 (mod 17), each of which lifts uniquely to a solution modulo 289.\nCritic agent bhHm, providing feedback, thinking: Agent YI7i is correct that one needs m^4≡−1 (mod 17), but that only guarantees a root mod 17. To force 17^2∣(m^4+1) we must lift these roots via Hensel’s lemma, using f′(m)=4m^3≢0 (mod 17). Each of the four solutions m≡2,8,9,15 (mod 17) lifts uniquely to a solution mod 289.; answer: m^4+1≡0 (mod 17^2) if and only if m≡r (mod 289) where r solves m^4≡−1 (mod 289). Equivalently the four residue classes are m≡110, 134, 155, or 179 (mod 289).\nReflexion CoT agent YI7i, refining condition for m, thinking: We have p=17. By Hensel’s lemma, a solution m mod 17 with m^4≡−1 (mod 17) and f′(m)=4m^3≢0 (mod 17) (automatic since m≢0) lifts uniquely to a solution mod 17^2. Thus the necessary and sufficient condition for 17^2|m^4+1 is m^4≡−1 (mod 17).; answer: m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 if and only if m^4≡−1 (mod 17); equivalently m≡2, 8, 9, or 15 (mod 17), each lifting uniquely to a solution modulo 289.\nCoT agent crKO, finding least positive integer m, thinking: We have p=17.
