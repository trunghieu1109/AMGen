In particular p must split in ℚ(i), so p≡1 (mod 4), and −1 must be a fourth power modulo p^2.; answer: The necessary and sufficient condition is that there exists an integer n with n^4≡−1 (mod p^2), which in turn requires p≡1 (mod 4) so that −1 is a fourth power modulo p^2.\nCoT-SC agent Z8Pk, determining least prime p, thinking: We need the smallest prime p≡1 mod4 for which n^4≡−1 mod\u2009p^2 has a solution. First p=5 (≡1 mod4) fails: no n^4≡24 mod25. Next p=13≡1 mod4 but −1 is not a fourth power mod13 (13−1=12≡4·3 so gcd(4,12)=4 gives fourth-power subgroup of order 3; 12/4=3, but ord(−1)=2∤4 so it fails lifting). For p≡1 mod8, −1=\u2009g^{(p−1)/2} is a fourth power mod\u2009p; the smallest such prime is 17. Indeed mod\u200917 one finds 2^4=16≡−1, and Hensel’s lemma lifts this to mod\u200917^2. Hence the least p is 17.; answer: 17\nCoT-SC agent NS9h, determining least prime p, thinking: We need p prime with n^4≡−1 (mod p^2). Necessarily p≡1 (mod8). The smallest such prime is 17, and by Hensel lifting a solution mod17 lifts to mod289, so p=17 works and is least.; answer: 17\nCoT-SC agent rBcW, determining least prime p, thinking: We seek the smallest prime p≡1 mod4 such that n^4≡−1 (mod p^2) has a solution. Test p=5: no n^4≡24 mod25. p=13: no n^4≡−1 mod13. p=17: mod17 there are solutions (e.g. n≡2 gives 2^4≡16), and since f′(n)=4n^3≡15≠0 mod17, Hensel’s lemma lifts this to mod289. Hence p=17.; answer: 17\nCoT agent e9Yc, identifying condition for m, thinking: We need the criterion for m^4+1≡0 mod\u2009p^2 when p=17.  One must first have a solution n mod\u2009p of n^4≡–1, and then lift it via Hensel’s lemma, which requires f′(n)=4n^3≠0 mod\u2009p.  Concretely for p=17 the roots of x^4≡16 mod17 are x≡±2,±8, each with 4x^3≠0 mod17, so each lifts uniquely to mod289.; answer: m must satisfy m≡n (mod\u200917) for some n with n^4≡−1 mod\u200917 and 4n^3≢0 mod\u200917 (so Hensel’s lemma applies).  Equivalently, m≡2,8,9, or 15 mod\u200917, each of which gives m^4+1 divisible by 17^2.\nCoT-SC agent CgBy, finding least m, thinking: We need the least m such that m^4+1≡0 mod17^2. First find roots r mod17 with r^4≡−1: r=2,8,9,15. Use Hensel lift: set m=r+17k and solve r^4+1+4r^3·17k≡0 mod289. For r=2: k≡9→m=155. For r=8: k≡6→m=110. For r=9: k≡10→m=179. For r=15: k≡7→m=134. The smallest positive m is 110.; answer: 110\nCoT-SC agent iij1, finding least m, thinking: We need the least m>0 with m^4+1≡0 mod\u200917^2.  Subtask 3 gave m≡2,8,9,15 mod17.  Use Hensel’s lemma to lift each to mod 289: for x0=2,8,9,15 compute k≡−(x0^4+1)/17·(4x0^3)^{-1} mod17 and x=x0+17k.  This yields lifts 155, 110, 179, 134.  The smallest positive is 110.; answer: 110\nCoT-SC agent gljt, finding least m, thinking: We know p=17 is the least prime such that n^4+1≡0 mod\u200917^2 has a solution.
