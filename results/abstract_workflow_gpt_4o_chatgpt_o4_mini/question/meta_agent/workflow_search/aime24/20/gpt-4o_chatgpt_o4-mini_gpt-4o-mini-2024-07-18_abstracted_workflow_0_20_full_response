Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Setting S=d₁+d₀ gives d₁=S(S−1)/(b−1) and d₀=S−d₁.  One must count all integer S∈[1,2(b−1)] for which (b−1) divides S(S−1) and yields valid digits.

Setting S = d₁ + d₀ gives n = S², and writing S² in base b yields d₁ = ⌊S²/b⌋, d₀ = S² mod b.  Equivalently one shows that (b−1) must divide S(S−1) and that d₁ = S(S−1)/(b−1) lies in [1,b−1], d₀ = S−d₁ in [0,b−1].

Equivalently, set S = d₁+d₀ and require S² = b·d₁ + d₀.  Solving for digits gives d₁ = S(S−1)/(b−1) and d₀ = S − d₁, with constraints 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1.
