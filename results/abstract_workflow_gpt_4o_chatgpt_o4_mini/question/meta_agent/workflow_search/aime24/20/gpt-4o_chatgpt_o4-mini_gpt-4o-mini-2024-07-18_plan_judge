Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: A b-beautiful number corresponds to S in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] with (b−1)∣S(S−1). One shows the total solutions in [0,b−2] is 2^{ω(b−1)}, so F(b)≈2^{ω(b−1)}. To exceed 10 we need ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 210, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211 is minimal.

proposed answer: The heuristic uses the count of nontrivial residue classes mod (b−1) to predict when there are enough digit‐sum representations S, giving b−1 with four distinct primes (210) and b=211 as the smallest candidate. However, it omits verifying the interval condition S≥⌈√b⌉ and the digit bounds 0≤A,B≤b−1. A full proof requires checking each S in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] that makes S(S−1) divisible by b−1 and yields valid digits. Without that enumeration, the result remains conjectural.

Answer:211
[TOO_HARD]
Please perform explicit enumeration of all integers S in the interval [⌈√b⌉, b−1] for b up to 211, checking which S produce valid base-b digits (A=S(S−1)/(b−1), B=S−A) to confirm there are indeed more than ten b-beautiful numbers.
