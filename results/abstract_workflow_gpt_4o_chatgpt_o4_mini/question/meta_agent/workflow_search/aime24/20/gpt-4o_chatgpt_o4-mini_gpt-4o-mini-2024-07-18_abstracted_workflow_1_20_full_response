Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Solutions correspond to S mod (b−1) in the 2^r classes given by S≡0 or1 mod each prime power dividing b−1. Excluding the trivial residue 1 (which gives A=0) there are 2^r−1 valid residues yielding exactly one S in [√b,b−1]. We need 2^r−1>10 ⇒2^r>11 ⇒r≥4.

It also skips a verification that A=S(S−1)/(b−1) and B=S−A stay within [1,b−1] and [0,b−1], respectively.

By definition it is b‐beautiful exactly when its two digits sum to √n, which must be integral.; answer: A positive integer n is b‐beautiful if and only if when written in base b as n = A·b + B (with 1≤A≤b−1, 0≤B≤b−1) one has A + B = √n. Equivalently, (A + B)² = A·b + B.\nReflexion CoT agent a7CO, calculating possible values, thinking: Deriving all b-beautiful numbers n requires solving A·b+B=S^2 with A+B=S and digit bounds.  One obtains A=(S(S-1))/(b-1), B=S−A and must check 1≤A≤b−1, 0≤B≤b−1.  Enumerating all S satisfying these for arbitrary b is cumbersome without fixing b or giving an algorithmic approach.; answer: For each base b≥2 the b-beautiful integers are exactly n=S^2 where S is an integer for which, setting\n A = S(S−1)/(b−1),  B = S−A,\n one has 1≤A≤b−1 and 0≤B≤b−1.

Integrality of A: One must insist explicitly that (b−1) divides S(S−1) so that A=S(S−1)/(b−1) is an integer.\n2. Bound on S: Since A≤b−1 and B≥0, we get S=A+B≤(b−1)+(b−1)=2(b−1), so S need only be checked up to 2(b−1).\n3. Enumeration complexity: Without these bounds, the search for S is unbounded; one should loop S=1…2(b−1) to guarantee finiteness.\n4. Edge cases: The formula requires A≥1 (leading digit nonzero) and B≤b−1, which must be restated clearly.\n\nBy omitting these, the method remains incomplete and does not provide a practical enumeration algorithm.; answer: To list all b-beautiful n:\n1. For each integer S from 1 to 2(b−1):\n   a. Check if (b−1) divides S(S−1). If not, skip this S.\n   b. Set A = S(S−1)/(b−1). If A<1 or A>b−1, skip.\n   c. Set B = S−A. If B<0 or B>b−1, skip.\n   d. Then n=S^2 is b-beautiful with base-b digits (A,B).\n2. Collect all such n; there are finitely many (at most 2(b−1)).\n\nThis fully specifies integrality and bounds, turning the criterion into a direct finite search algorithm.\nReflexion CoT agent a7CO, refining possible values, thinking: The general enumeration across all bases b≥2 is unbounded unless b is fixed or a range specified. One can characterize b-beautiful n by letting S=A+B and n=S², with A and B the base-b digits. Integrality and digit‐bounds force S to lie in 1…2(b−1) and (b−1)∣S(S−1). Without fixing b (or bounding b), one cannot list concrete n values.; answer: For a given base b≥2, the b-beautiful integers are exactly those n=S² where S runs over integers 1≤S≤2(b−1) satisfying:\n 1. (b−1) divides S(S−1),\n 2. A=S(S−1)/(b−1) lies in [1,b−1],\n 3.

However, it has several limitations: 1) It assumes you can handle an unbounded base b, so it never actually produces a finite list of n without further bounds. 2) Checking divisibility S(S−1)≡0 mod (b−1) and then verifying 1≤A≤b−1, 0≤B≤b−1 still requires O(b) work per base and doesn’t simplify counting or finding the least b with >10 solutions. 3) It gives a necessary and sufficient test but no strategy for efficiently scanning bases or bounding how large b must be to get more than ten b-beautiful numbers.; answer: To enumerate b-beautiful n in practice: fix your base b; then either\n 1. Brute–force digits: for A from 1 to b−1 and B from 0 to b−1 compute n=A·b+B and check if A+B=√n;\n 2. Or use the S-parametrization: loop S=1,…,2(b−1); if (b−1)∣S(S−1), set A=S(S−1)/(b−1), B=S−A, and if 1≤A≤b−1,0≤B≤b−1 record n=S².  \nThis yields all b-beautiful n. To find the least b with more than ten such n, one must scan increasing b and count solutions until the total exceeds ten.\nReflexion CoT agent a7CO, refining possible values, thinking: To enumerate b-beautiful numbers for each b≥2 one must loop over an infinite set of bases. We can give a finite characterization in terms of S for each fixed b, but without bounding b the problem of listing all n is unbounded and cannot be completed. Hence the sub-task as stated is too broad.; answer: For each integer base b≥2, the b-beautiful positive integers are exactly those n of the form n=S² where S is an integer with 1≤S≤2(b−1) satisfying:  (b−1) divides S(S−1), and if we set A=S(S−1)/(b−1) and B=S−A, then 1≤A≤b−1 and 0≤B≤b−1.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify a concrete base b or an upper bound on b so that these n can be explicitly listed.\nCritic agent ahf6, providing feedback, thinking: The provided parametrization correctly captures that any two-digit base-b beautiful number satisfies n = A b + B = S² with S = A + B, leading to A = (S²−S)/(b−1) and B = S−A subject to 1≤A≤b−1 and 0≤B≤b−1. However, it stops short of actually enumerating values for any specific b, does not bound b or show how to find the smallest b with more than ten solutions, and thus remains only a theoretical characterization rather than a concrete listing. It also omits the practical observation that S need only range up to 2(b−1).; answer: For a fixed base b≥2, one can enumerate b-beautiful numbers by:  \n1. Loop S from 1 to 2(b−1).\n2. Compute A = (S²−S)/(b−1).  If A∈ℤ and 1≤A≤b−1, set B=S−A and check 0≤B≤b−1.\n3. Whenever valid, record n=S².  Count these n for each b, and stop when the count exceeds ten.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify a concrete upper bound on b or agree to run the above enumeration for b up to a reasonable limit (e.g. b≤50) to identify the least base with more than ten such numbers.\nReflexion CoT agent a7CO, refining possible values, thinking: Sub‐task 3 asks for an explicit list of b‐beautiful n for each base b≥2, but b ranges over infinitely many values.
