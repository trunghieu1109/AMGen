    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textiteautiful\) because \(81  = \underline6 \ \underline3_13 \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt81\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) integers.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the range of possible two-digit numbers in base b. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent QpIq:
A two‐digit base‐b number has form A·b+B with A∈{1,…,b−1}, B∈{0,…,b−1}. The smallest is 1·b+0=b and the largest is (b−1)·b+(b−1)=b²−1.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent QpIq:
The two‐digit numbers in base b range from b (inclusive) to b²−1 (inclusive).

### Sub-task 2: Determine the condition for a number n to be b-beautiful. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HEoD:
We need to express the condition in terms of base-b digits. A two-digit base-b number has form n = A·b + B with 1 ≤ A ≤ b−1, 0 ≤ B ≤ b−1. The b-beautiful requirement is that the sum of its digits equals its integer square root.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent HEoD:
A positive integer n is b-beautiful if and only if there exist integers A,B with 1 ≤ A ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ B ≤ b−1 such that n = A·b + B and A + B = √n.

### Sub-task 3: Calculate possible values of n for each base b. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent a7CO:
Sub‐task 3 asks for an explicit list of b‐beautiful n for each base b≥2, but b ranges over infinitely many values. We can only give a parametrization in terms of b and S, not a finite enumeration over all bases. To produce concrete n‐values one must fix or bound b.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent a7CO:
For each integer base b≥2, the b‐beautiful positive integers n are exactly those of the form n=S², where S runs over integers 1≤S≤2(b−1) satisfying:
 1. (b−1) divides S(S−1),
 2. A = S(S−1)/(b−1) lies in [1,b−1],
 3. B = S – A lies in [0,b−1].

[TOO_HARD]
Please specify a fixed base b or an upper bound on b to enumerate the concrete values of n.

### Sub-task 4: Count the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base b and find the smallest base with more than ten such numbers. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent B8Tm (yourself):
We have n beautiful in base b iff n=S^2 with S integer and A=S(S−1)/(b−1), B=S−A satisfy 1≤A≤b−1,0≤B≤b−1. Solutions correspond to S mod (b−1) in the 2^r classes given by S≡0 or1 mod each prime power dividing b−1. Excluding the trivial residue 1 (which gives A=0) there are 2^r−1 valid residues yielding exactly one S in [√b,b−1]. We need 2^r−1&gt;10 ⇒2^r&gt;11 ⇒r≥4. The smallest b−1 with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=211.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent B8Tm (yourself):
211

### Review the counting process and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent pZM9:
The residue‐counting shortcut (2^r−1 valid classes mod b−1 when b−1 has r distinct prime factors) assumes each residue class automatically gives one two‐digit solution S in [√b,b−1], but it never checks the lower bound S≥√b needed for n=S^2 to be ≥b. It also skips a verification that A=S(S−1)/(b−1) and B=S−A stay within [1,b−1] and [0,b−1], respectively. In edge cases (especially for smaller b) some residue representatives could fall below √b or violate the digit constraints, so a complete count must explicitly filter by √b≤S&lt;b and then confirm valid digits rather than relying solely on the cardinality 2^r−1.

### Sub-task 4: Count the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base b and find the smallest base with more than ten such numbers. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent B8Tm (yourself):
The residue-class count 2^r−1 for b−1 having r distinct primes gives a heuristic threshold (r≥4→b−1≥210→b≥211) but omits checks that each representative S lies in [√b,b−1] and that A,S−A are valid base-b digits. A full proof requires enumerating S for b up to 211 or confirming lower bounds, so the problem is intricate and would benefit from computational verification or a refined decomposition.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent B8Tm (yourself):
211
[TOO_HARD]
Please perform an explicit enumeration of S in [√b,b−1] for b up to 211 (or provide tighter analytic bounds) to confirm which residue classes yield valid b-beautiful numbers.

### Review the counting process and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent pZM9:
The heuristic uses the count of divisors of b−1 (via 2^r−1 for r distinct primes) to predict when there are enough representations S = d1 + d2, but it never verifies that each S lies in the valid interval [√n,b−1] or that both digits are between 0 and b−1. It also omits checking that √n is integer, that the two representations yield distinct n, and that n actually has two base‐b digits. In short, it skips the digit‐range constraint and fails to enumerate or bound the actual solutions.

### Sub-task 4: Count the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base b and find the smallest base with more than ten such numbers. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent B8Tm (yourself):
A heuristic count uses that for base b, n is b-beautiful when n=S^2 with digits A,B satisfying S=A+B, and each valid residue class mod (b−1) gives a candidate S. If b−1 has r distinct primes there are 2^r−1 residue classes, so to exceed ten we need r≥4, giving the smallest b−1=2·3·5·7=210 and b=211. However, this shortcut omits the constraints S≥√b and 0≤A,B≤b−1; verifying these requires explicit enumeration of S in [√b,b−1] and checking digit bounds. The full count is thus more involved and needs computational or analytic confirmation.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent B8Tm (yourself):
211
[TOO_HARD]
Please explicitly enumerate all integers S in the interval [⌈√b⌉, b−1] for b up to 211 and check which yield valid base-b digits (A=S(S−1)/(b−1), B=S−A) to confirm there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.

### Review the counting process and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent pZM9:
The residue-class heuristic assumes each nonzero residue mod (b−1) yields a valid digit-sum S in [√b,b−1] and that A=S(S−1)/(b−1), B=S−A automatically lie in [0,b−1]. In reality you must check: (1) S must be at least ⌈√b⌉ and at most b−1, (2) S(S−1) must be divisible by b−1 to give an integer A, and (3) both A and B=S−A must satisfy 0≤A,B≤b−1. Ignoring these constraints can vastly overcount potentials.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Count the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base b and find the smallest base with more than ten such numbers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The heuristic uses the count of nontrivial residue classes mod (b−1) to predict when there are enough digit‐sum representations S, giving b−1 with four distinct primes (210) and b=211 as the smallest candidate. However, it omits verifying the interval condition S≥⌈√b⌉ and the digit bounds 0≤A,B≤b−1. A full proof requires checking each S in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] that makes S(S−1) divisible by b−1 and yields valid digits. Without that enumeration, the result remains conjectural.

Answer:211
[TOO_HARD]
Please perform explicit enumeration of all integers S in the interval [⌈√b⌉, b−1] for b up to 211, checking which S produce valid base-b digits (A=S(S−1)/(b−1), B=S−A) to confirm there are indeed more than ten b-beautiful numbers.</pre>
