One shows the total solutions in [0,b\u22122] is 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}, so F(b)\u22482^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}. To exceed 10 we need \u03c9(b\u22121)\u22654. The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 210, so b\u22121=210 \u21d2 b=211 is minimal.\n\nAnswer:211",

        "response": "The heuristic uses the count of nontrivial residue classes mod\u2009(b\u22121) to predict when there are enough digit\u2010sum representations S, giving b\u22121 with four distinct primes (210) and b=211 as the smallest candidate. However, it omits verifying the interval condition S\u2265\u2308\u221ab\u2309 and the digit bounds 0\u2264A,B\u2264b\u22121. A full proof requires checking each S in [\u2308\u221ab\u2309,b\u22121] that makes S(S\u22121) divisible by b\u22121 and yields valid digits. Without that enumeration, the result remains conjectural.\n\nAnswer:211\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease perform explicit enumeration of all integers S in the interval [\u2308\u221ab\u2309, b\u22121] for b up to 211, checking which S produce valid base-b digits (A=S(S\u22121)/(b\u22121), B=S\u2212A) to confirm there are indeed more than ten b-beautiful numbers.",
