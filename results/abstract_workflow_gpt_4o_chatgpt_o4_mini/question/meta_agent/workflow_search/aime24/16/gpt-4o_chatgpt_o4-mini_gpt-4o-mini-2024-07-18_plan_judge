Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_16
proposed answer: We use the right‐triangle relation in ΔOIA since IA⊥OI: OA=R=13, OI^2=R(R−2r)=13, so IA^2=169−13=156. Thus IA=r/ sin(A/2)=2√39 ⇒ sin(A/2)=3/√39 ⇒ sinA=2 sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2√30/13. Then a=BC=2R sinA=4√30. Using s=r( cot(A/2)+cot(B/2)+cot(C/2) ) with cot(A/2)=√30/3 and cot(B/2)+cot(C/2)=2√30/3 gives s=6√30. Finally bc=2rs/ sinA=(12·6√30)/(2√30/13)=468.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_16
proposed answer: Using R=13, r=6 and IA⊥OI gives OI=√13, IA=√156 and hence (s−a)=√(IA²−r²)=2√30.  However s itself remains undetermined, so we cannot compute bc=AB·AC numerically without a second relation linking s (or b,c) or an angle value.

Answer:Unable to determine AB·AC uniquely from the given data.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide an additional relation (for example, an angle measure or a relation among b and c) to resolve the semi‐perimeter and compute AB·AC.
