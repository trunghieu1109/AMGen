By Euler’s formula OI^2 = R^2−2Rr and the incenter–vertex distance IA = r/sin(A/2).  Hence R^2 = (R^2−2Rr)+(r^2/sin^2(A/2)), so 2Rr = r^2/sin^2(A/2), giving sin^2(A/2)=r/(2R).; answer: sin(A/2)=√(r/(2R)), equivalently r=2R\u2009sin^2(A/2) (or cos\u2009A=1−r/R).\nCoT agent 5k9V, applying circumradius and inradius, thinking: We have R=13, r=6 so sin²(A/2)=r/(2R)=6/26=3/13 ⇒ sin(A/2)=√(3/13).  From cos\u2009A=1−r/R=7/13 we get sin\u2009A=2√30/13 and hence a=2R\u2009sin\u2009A=26·(2√30/13)=4√30.  The area Δ satisfies Δ=rs=6s and also Δ=abc/(4R)=abc/52, so 6s=abc/52 ⇒ abc=312s ⇒ s=abc/312.; answer: sin(A/2)=√(3/13), cos\u2009A=7/13, sin\u2009A=2√30/13 ⇒ a=4√30.  Area Δ=6s and Δ=abc/52 ⇒ abc=312s ⇒ s=abc/312.\nCoT agent rLz3, expressing AB * AC, thinking: To express AB⋅AC=bc, we use Δ=½bc\u2009sinA and Δ=rs.  Hence bc=2Δ/sinA=2rs/sinA=2r\u2009s/\u2009sinA.
