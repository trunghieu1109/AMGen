    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overlineIA\perp\overlineOI$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle using the inradius and circumradius. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent feBM:
The semi-perimeter s satisfies r = Δ/s and Δ = abc/(4R), so rs = abc/(4R) ⇒ s = abc/(4Rr). Without additional relations (e.g. side ratios from IA ⟂ OI) we cannot find a numeric value for s solely from R and r.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent feBM:
s = \frac{abc}{4Rr}
[TOO_HARD]
Need either the product abc or another relation (e.g. from IA ⟂ OI) to determine a numeric value for s.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Use the semi-perimeter and the known radii to find the product AB * AC.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Using R=13, r=6 and IA⊥OI gives OI=√13, IA=√156 and hence (s−a)=√(IA²−r²)=2√30.  However s itself remains undetermined, so we cannot compute bc=AB·AC numerically without a second relation linking s (or b,c) or an angle value.

Answer:Unable to determine AB·AC uniquely from the given data.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide an additional relation (for example, an angle measure or a relation among b and c) to resolve the semi‐perimeter and compute AB·AC.</pre>
