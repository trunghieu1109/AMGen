Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\beginequation*
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\endequation*. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Filter the combinations from subtask_1 to find those that satisfy the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FuJi:
We apply the symmetric identity a²b+a²c+b²a+b²c+c²a+c²b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) − 3abc with a+b+c=300, giving 300·(ab+bc+ca)−3abc=6·10^6 ⇒100·(ab+bc+ca)−abc=2·10^6.  One checks that this holds exactly when at least one of a,b,c equals 100, and no other nonnegative solutions arise.  Counting: for each coordinate set to 100 there are 201 ways to choose the other two summing to 200, but the all-100 triple is counted three times, so total = 3·201−2 = 601.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FuJi:
All nonnegative triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and at least one of a,b,c equal to 100.  There are 601 such triples.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Count the number of valid triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both conditions from stage_1.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
