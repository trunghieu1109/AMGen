Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_17
proposed answer: Using the result from sub-task 2 that the only solutions occur when at least one of a, b, c equals 100 and a+b+c=300, we count these triples: for each coordinate set to 100 there are 201 ways to choose the other two summing to 200, with the all-100 triple counted three times, giving 3×201−2=601.

proposed answer: From the simplification we found the only nonnegative integer solutions are the six permutations of (200,100,0), giving 6 ordered triples.
