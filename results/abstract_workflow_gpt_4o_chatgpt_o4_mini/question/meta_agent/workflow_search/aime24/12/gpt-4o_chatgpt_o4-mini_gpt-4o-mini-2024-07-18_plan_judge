Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_12
proposed answer: We have real part R(θ)=300 cosθ−1044 sinθ+96. The maximum of A cosθ+B sinθ is √(A²+B²). Here A=300, B=−1044 so √(300²+1044²)=√1,179,936. Thus max R=96+√1,179,936.

Answer:96+√1179936
Extracted answer: 96+√1179936
Correct answer: 540
Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_12
proposed answer: We interpret “\frac96+144iz” as (96+144i)z. Combining terms gives (75+117i)z+(96+144i)z=(171+261i)z. For |z|=4, the maximum real part is |171+261i|·4=4·√(171²+261²)=4·9√1202=36√1202.
