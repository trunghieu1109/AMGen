    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\fracx^220- \fracy^224 = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Determine the maximum possible value of BD^2 by analyzing the expressions derived and considering the constraints. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Sgx6:
We have BD² = 4(20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ) = 80 + 96 tan²φ. The orthogonality constraint can force tan²φ arbitrarily large, so BD²→∞ and no finite maximum exists.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 0YH5:
From the expression BD² = 4(20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ) = 80 + 96 tan²φ and the orthogonality condition on φ, tan²φ can grow without bound, forcing BD² → ∞.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Sgx6:
BD² is unbounded above; no finite maximum exists.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 0YH5:
BD² is unbounded above; no finite maximum exists.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on maximum BD^2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
