These are standard: x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1, a rhombus has equal sides and perpendicular bisecting diagonals meeting at the midpoint (here the origin), and vertices come in opposite pairs A = –C, B = –D.; answer: General equation of the hyperbola: x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1.\n\nRhombus properties and diagonals–vertices relationship:\n1. All four sides are equal in length.\n2. Diagonals bisect each other at right angles and meet at the midpoint of both diagonals.\n3. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if A and C are opposite vertices then C = –A, and if B and D are opposite vertices then D = –B.\n4. The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, so the slope of AC times the slope of BD = –1.\n5. All vertices A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), C(–x1,–y1), D(–x2,–y2) must satisfy x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1.\nCoT-SC agent CRDE, determining conditions, thinking: To force diagonals to meet at the origin, each diagonal’s midpoint must be (0,0).  For any pair of opposite vertices P and Q, the midpoint condition (P+Q)/2=0 implies Q=−P.  Thus if A=(x1,y1) and B=(x2,y2), we must have C=(−x1,−y1) and D=(−x2,−y2).  Lastly, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so (x1)^2/20−(y1)^2/24=1 and (x2)^2/20−(y2)^2/24=1.; answer: Label A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2), C=(−x1,−y1), D=(−x2,−y2).  Then the diagonals AC and BD both have midpoint (0,0), so they intersect at the origin.  Additionally, A and B lie on the hyperbola, so x1^2/20−y1^2/24=1 and x2^2/20−y2^2/24=1.\nCoT-SC agent EZEj, determining conditions, thinking: To intersect at the origin, the midpoint of each diagonal must be (0,0).  On a hyperbola x^2/20–y^2/24=1, if A and C are opposite vertices then (x_A+x_C)/2=0 and (y_A+y_C)/2=0, so C=–A; similarly D=–B.  Each of A,B then must satisfy the hyperbola equation.; answer: The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin precisely when the midpoint of each diagonal is (0,0).  Equivalently, if A=(x₁,y₁), B=(x₂,y₂) are two adjacent vertices on the hyperbola x²/20–y²/24=1, then the opposite vertices are C=(–x₁,–y₁) and D=(–x₂,–y₂).  Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n1. C=–A and D=–B (so (A+C)/2=(B+D)/2=(0,0));\n2. A and B each satisfy x²/20–y²/24=1.\nCoT-SC agent 8AfY, determining conditions, thinking: To ensure the diagonals of rhombus ABCD meet at the origin, we must place opposite vertices symmetrically about the origin. Then to maintain rhombus properties (equal sides and perpendicular diagonals), the slopes of the two diagonals must be negative reciprocals. Finally each vertex must lie on the hyperbola.; answer: The diagonals of ABCD intersect at the origin precisely when:\n1. Opposite vertices are negatives of each other: if A=(x₁,y₁) and B=(x₂,y₂), then C=(−x₁,−y₁) and D=(−x₂,−y₂).\n2. Each vertex lies on the hyperbola x²/20 − y²/24 = 1, i.e.\n   x₁²/20 − y₁²/24 = 1,   x₂²/20 − y₂²/24 = 1.\n3. The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, so their slopes satisfy (y₁/x₁)·(y₂/x₂)=−1, equivalently x₁·x₂ + y₁·y₂ = 0.\nReflexion CoT agent BFFw, expressing coordinates, thinking: To express A, B, C, D we use the standard trig‐parameterization of x^2/20−y^2/24=1 and impose the condition that diagonals AC⊥BD, which gives (y1/x1)(y2/x2)=−1 ⇒ (24/20)sinθ\u2009sinφ=−1 ⇒ sinθ\u2009sinφ=−5/6.; answer: Let θ,φ be real parameters satisfying sinθ·sinφ=−5/6.

However, the perpendicular‐diagonals condition yields A·B=0 ⇒ sinθ·sinφ=+5/6 (not −5/6).; answer: Let θ,φ satisfy sinθ·sinφ=5/6.

Using the standard hyperbola parameterization x=√20 sec t, y=√24 tan t gives the required expressions.; answer: Let θ, φ be real parameters satisfying sinθ·sinφ = 5/6. Then the vertices are:\nA = (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ) = (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ),\nB = (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ) = (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ),\nC = −A,\nD = −B.\nThese points lie on x²/20 − y²/24 = 1 and form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting perpendicularly at the origin.\nCritic agent 9ixv, providing feedback, thinking: The hyperbola parametrization A=(2√5 secθ,2√6 tanθ), B=(2√5 secφ,2√6 tanφ), C=−A, D=−B is correct for x²/20−y²/24=1.

The rhombus diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular in the Euclidean sense, so the dot product x_A x_B + y_A y_B = 0. Computing gives 20 secθ secφ + 24 tanθ tanφ = 0 ⇒ sinθ·sinφ = –5/6.; answer: Let θ, φ be real parameters satisfying sinθ·sinφ = –5/6.\n\nThen the vertices are:\nA = (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ) = (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ),\nB = (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ) = (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ),\nC = –A,\nD = –B.\nCritic agent 9ixv, providing feedback, thinking: The parameterization and perpendicular-diagonal condition are correctly derived. For the hyperbola x^2/20−y^2/24=1, one may set x=2√5 sec(t), y=2√6 tan(t). With A=(2√5 secθ,2√6 tanθ), B=(2√5 secφ,2√6 tanφ), C=−A, D=−B, the dot‐product condition A·B=0 yields sinθ·sinφ=−5/6.

Orthogonality of A and B gives sinθ\u2009sinφ=−5/6, so tan²φ=25/(36\u2009sin²θ−25), with sin²θ>25/36. As sin²θ→25/36⁺, the denominator→0⁺, so BD²→∞. Hence BD² is unbounded above and has no finite maximum.; answer: BD² has no maximum; it is unbounded above.\nDebate agent Sgx6, round 1, determining maximum BD^2, thinking: Using the expression BD² = 4(20\u2009sec²φ + 24\u2009tan²φ) and the orthogonality constraint sinθ·sinφ = −5/6, one finds tan²φ → ∞ as sin²θ → 25/36⁺. Hence BD² → ∞ and is unbounded above.; answer: BD^2 is unbounded above; no maximum exists.\nDebate agent 0YH5, round 1, determining maximum BD^2, thinking: From the rhombus condition one finds BD²=4(20\u2009sec²φ+24\u2009tan²φ)=80+96\u2009tan²φ. The orthogonality constraint forces tan²φ to become arbitrarily large, so BD² grows without bound.
