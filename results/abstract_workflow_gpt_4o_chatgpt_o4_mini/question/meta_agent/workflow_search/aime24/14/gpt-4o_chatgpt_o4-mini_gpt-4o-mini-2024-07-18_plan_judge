Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_14
proposed answer: From the expression BD² = 80 + 96 tan²φ and the fact that tan²φ can grow without bound under the orthogonality constraint, BD² → ∞. Therefore there is no finite maximum value of BD².

Answer:BD² is unbounded above; no finite maximum exists.
Extracted answer: BD² is unbounded above; no finite maximum exists.
Correct answer: 480

proposed answer: We have B=(2√5 cosh v,2√6 sinh v) and D=–B, so the vector BD=2B. Hence
BD²=(4√5 cosh v)²+(4√6 sinh v)²=80 cosh²v+96 sinh²v=80+176 sinh²v.  The orthogonality constraint tanh u·tanh v=–5/6 only forces |tanh v|>5/6, so as |tanh v|→1 one has sinh²v→∞.  Thus BD² grows without bound and no finite maximum exists.

Answer:BD² = 80 cosh²v + 96 sinh²v = 80 + 176 sinh²v. There is no finite maximum; BD² → ∞ as |tanh v| → 1.
Extracted answer: BD² = 80 cosh²v + 96 sinh²v = 80 + 176 sinh²v. There is no finite maximum; BD² → ∞ as |tanh v| → 1.
Correct answer: 480
