Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

Key ideas include tangent‐chord angles, equal tangent lengths, power of a point, and pole–polar relationships.; answer: 1) Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle ω, so AB, BC, and CA are chords of ω.\n2) The lines through D tangent to ω at B and C satisfy DB = DC (equal tangent segments from D).\n3) By the tangent–chord theorem, ∠DBC = ∠BAC and ∠DCB = ∠ABC.\n4) Points A, D, and P are collinear; AD is a secant cutting ω again at P.\n5) By power of a point at D: DA·DP = DB² = DC².\n6) Equivalently, D is the pole of line AP and AP is the polar of D with respect to ω.\nCoT-SC agent 8RXC, applying power of a point theorem, thinking: The power of a point theorem at D relates the lengths of the two tangents from D to ω and the secant through D. Since DB and DC are tangents, DB=DC, and the secant DA·DP equals the square of the tangent length.
