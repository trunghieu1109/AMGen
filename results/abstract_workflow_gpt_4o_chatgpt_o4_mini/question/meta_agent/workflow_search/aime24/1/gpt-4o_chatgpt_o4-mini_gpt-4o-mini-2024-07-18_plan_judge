Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We place triangle ABC with B(0,0), C(9,0), A(1/3,4√14/3), find the circle, tangents at B,C, their intersection D, parametrize line AD, solve for the second intersection P, and compute AP=|b|/√a giving 100/13.

Answer:AP = 100/13
Extracted answer: AP = 100/13
Correct answer: 113

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_1
proposed answer: We previously determined AP = 100/13 in lowest terms, so m = 100 and n = 13. Therefore m + n = 113.
