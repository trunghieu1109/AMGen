    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overlineAD$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\fracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Use the Power of a Point theorem to relate segments AD, AP, and tangents from D to the circle. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent mLLe:
We apply the Power of a Point at D. The tangents from D to ω have equal lengths DB = DC. By Power of a Point, the product of the distances from D to the two intersections of line AD with ω equals the square of the tangent length.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent mLLe:
DA·DP = DB² = DC².  Since DP = DA + AP, this gives DA(DA + AP) = DB².

### Sub-task 3: Apply the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC to find angles or other necessary measures to determine AP. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 440z:
We need measures from triangle ABC using Law of Cosines to later find AP.  With sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10:
cos A=(AB²+AC²−BC²)/(2·AB·AC)=(25+100−81)/(100)=44/100=11/25.
cos B=(AB²+BC²−AC²)/(2·AB·BC)=(25+81−100)/(90)=6/90=1/15.
Then ∠C=180°−A−B.  These angle measures feed into the power‐of‐a‐point or similar‐triangle arguments for AP.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 440z:
cos∠A=11/25 ⇒ ∠A=arccos(11/25);
cos∠B=1/15 ⇒ ∠B=arccos(1/15);
∠C=180°−∠A−∠B

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Use derived relationships to express AP in the form m/n and ensure m and n are coprime.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
