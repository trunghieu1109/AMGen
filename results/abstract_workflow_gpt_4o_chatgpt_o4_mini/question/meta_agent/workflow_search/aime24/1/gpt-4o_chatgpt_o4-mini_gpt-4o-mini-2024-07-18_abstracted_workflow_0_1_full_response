Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

By the two‐tangent theorem, the lengths of the tangents from D to ω satisfy DB = DC.  Additionally, by the alternate‐segment theorem, the angle between a tangent and a chord equals the angle in the opposite segment, so ∠DBC = ∠BAC and ∠BCD = ∠BÂC.  Finally, ∠BDC = 180° − measure of arc BC.; answer: Triangle ABC is inscribed in ω since A, B, C lie on ω as given.  The tangents at B and C meet at D, and by the two‐tangent theorem DB = DC.  Moreover, by the alternate‐segment theorem, ∠DBC = ∠BAC and ∠BCD = ∠BÂC, and ∠BDC = 180° − arc\u2009BC.\nCoT agent mLLe, applying Power of a Point theorem, thinking: We apply the Power of a Point at D.
