    <pre>Related original question:

Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac12|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac14|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text and \quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Identify the conditions under which the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) intersect. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ghw3:
To characterize intersections, we must solve the coupled piecewise‐linear system
  y = 4·|||sin(2πx)| − ½| − ¼|
  x = 4·|||cos(3πy)| − ½| − ¼|
for (x,y)∈[0,1]².  Equivalently introduce φ(t)=4·|||t−½|−¼| for t∈[0,1], which is linear on the four subintervals [0,¼],[¼,½],[½,¾],[¾,1].  One then must match y=φ(|sin(2πx)|) and x=φ(|cos(3πy)|) across the 4×4=16 region–pairs determined by which interval each absolute‐value lies in.  Manually solving all 16 linear systems is extremely tedious and prone to error, so a systematic or computational approach is advisable.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ghw3:
Intersections occur at (x,y)∈[0,1]² satisfying
  y = φ(|sin(2πx)|)
  x = φ(|cos(3πy)|)
where φ:[0,1]→[0,1] is given by
  φ(t)=1−4t       for 0≤t≤¼
  φ(t)=4t−1       for ¼≤t≤½
  φ(t)=3−4t       for ½≤t≤¾
  φ(t)=4t−3       for ¾≤t≤1
[TOO_HARD]
Partition the unit square into the 16 region‐pairs defined by |sin(2πx)|∈[0,¼],[¼,½],[½,¾],[¾,1] and |cos(3πy)| in the same four intervals, then solve each resulting linear system via computer algebra due to the sheer number of cases.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Count the number of intersections based on the conditions identified.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The intersection count requires solving a highly piecewise-linear system with 16 region‐pairs. An exact manual count is extremely tedious without a systematic computational approach. Given the complexity, a brute‐force or symbolic CASE breakdown is needed to ensure no solutions are missed.

Answer:16
[TOO_HARD]
Suggest performing a computer‐algebra or numerical sweep over the 16 subcases (|sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| each in four intervals) to rigorously count all fixed points.</pre>
