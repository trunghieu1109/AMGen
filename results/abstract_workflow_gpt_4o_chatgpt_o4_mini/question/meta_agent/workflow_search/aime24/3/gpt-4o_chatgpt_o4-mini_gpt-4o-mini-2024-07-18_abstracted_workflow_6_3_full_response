Substituting gives the fixed‐point condition x = B(A(x)), or equivalently y = A(B(y)).  Because A and B are even, piecewise‐linear maps with kinks at |·|=¼,½,¾,1, the only possible intersection points occur when sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) hit those critical values, reducing each branch to a linear equation.  One must partition x (resp. y) into the intervals where |sin(2πx)| (resp. |cos(3πy)|) lies between consecutive breakpoints, write A and B as linear functions on each interval, and then solve x = B(A(x)) (or y = A(B(y))) in each region.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent PoaH:\nThe graphs intersect exactly at points (x,y) satisfying\n    y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))  and  x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))),\nwhich is equivalent to the single fixed‐point equation\n    x = 4g\\bigl(f(\\cos(3\\pi\\,(4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))))))\\bigr).\nEquivalently, intersections correspond to x such that\n    x = (B∘A)(x)\nand y such that\n    y = (A∘B)(y).\nBecause A and B are piecewise linear with kinks when |sin(2πx)| or |cos(3πy)| ∈ {¼,½,¾,1}, one must:\n1.

Substituting gives the fixed‐point condition x = B(A(x)), or equivalently y = A(B(y)).  Because A and B are even, piecewise‐linear maps with kinks at |·|=¼,½,¾,1, the only possible intersection points occur when sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) hit those critical values, reducing each branch to a linear equation.

Both A and B map [0,1] into [0,1], with breakpoints whenever |sin2πx| or |cos3πy| equals ¼,½,¾,1. That yields a finite collection of linear segments—24 regions in x and 32 in y—on each of which the composition B∘A is affine. One must count the solutions of x=(B∘A)(x) on each region.
