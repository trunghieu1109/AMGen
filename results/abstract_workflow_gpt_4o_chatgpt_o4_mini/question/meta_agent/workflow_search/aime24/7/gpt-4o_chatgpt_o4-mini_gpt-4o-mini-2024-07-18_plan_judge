Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_7
proposed answer: From subtask 4 we have x = 45/2 and y = (45/2)^(4/9). Their product is x*y = (45/2) * (45/2)^(4/9) = (45/2)^(1 + 4/9) = (45/2)^(13/9).

Answer:(45/2)^(13/9)
Extracted answer: (45/2)^(13/9)
Correct answer: 025

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_3_7
proposed answer: We have x=45/2 and y=(45/2)^{4/9}. Thus xy=(45/2)*(45/2)^{4/9}=(45/2)^{1+4/9}=(45/2)^{13/9}.

Answer:(45/2)^{13/9}
Extracted answer: (45/2)^{13/9}
Correct answer: 025
