Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wD9v', content='Let x_i be the number of residents owning exactly i of the four items. We have: total residents =900 so x1+x2+x3+x4=900, and sum of set sizes =195+367+562+900=2024 equals x1+2x2+3x3+4x4. Substituting x2=437, x3=234 gives 2024 = x1+874+702+4x4 => x1=448−4x4, and from x1+x4=900−(437+234)=229 ⇒448−4x4+x4=229 ⇒3x4=219 ⇒x4=73.\n\nAnswer:73', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

We have x_2=437, x_3=234, and x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=900. Also the total item‐ownership count is 195+367+562+900=2024, which equals x_1+2x_2+3x_3+4x_4. Solving x_1+437+234+x_4=900 gives x_1+x_4=229. Then x_1+2·437+3·234+4x_4=2024 gives x_1+4x_4=448.
