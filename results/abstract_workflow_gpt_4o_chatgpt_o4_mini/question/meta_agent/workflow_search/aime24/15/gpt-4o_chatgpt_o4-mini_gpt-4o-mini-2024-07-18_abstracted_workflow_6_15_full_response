Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

By inclusion–exclusion or by using the given counts of those owning exactly 2, 3, and 4 items, one finds there are 744 such residents.; answer: 744\nCoT-SC agent rvuL, calculating residents with exactly one item, thinking: Each resident owns hearts. Those owning exactly two of the four items are hearts + exactly one of the three. Given 437 residents own exactly two of the four, that equals those owning exactly one of the three.; answer: 437\nCoT-SC agent as9z, calculating residents with exactly one item, thinking: We note that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Thus “owning exactly two of the four items” means hearts + exactly one of the three {ring, clubs, spade}. Hence the given 437 residents owning exactly two of the four own exactly one of the three.; answer: 437\nCoT-SC agent NHCG, calculating residents with exactly one item, thinking: Let A, B, C be the numbers owning exactly 1, 2, 3 of the three items (ring, clubs, spade) alongside hearts. From Sub-task 1 we have A+B+C=744. Given B=437 and C=234, A=744−437−234=73.; answer: 73\nCoT agent MUK3, determining residents with all three items, thinking: We need counts of residents owning each pair of the three items or the number owning exactly two of the three (R, G, S) to apply inclusion–exclusion and find the triple intersection. That information is missing, so the number owning all three cannot be determined.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the sizes of the intersections of each pair among diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.\nCoT-SC agent lpaQ, calculating residents with all four items, thinking: Let X_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of the four items. We know X_2=437, X_3=234 and X_0=0. Since everyone owns at least candy hearts, X_1+X_2+X_3+X_4=900 ⇒ X_1+X_4=900–437–234=229. Also the total of single‐set memberships is 195+367+562+900=2024, which equals ∑k·X_k =X_1+2·437+3·234+4·X_4 ⇒ X_1+4X_4=2024–(874+702)=448. Subtracting the two equations gives 3X_4=219 ⇒ X_4=73.; answer: 73\nCoT-SC agent R4MA, calculating residents with all four items, thinking: To find how many own all four items, we need the count owning all three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade, since everyone owns candy hearts. That triple-intersection wasn’t determined in sub-task 3 due to missing pairwise intersection sizes, so we can’t compute the number owning all four.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the sizes of the intersections of each pair among diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade so we can determine the triple overlap (and hence the number owning all four).\nCoT-SC agent K6tI, calculating residents with all four items, thinking: Let x1,x2,x3,x4 be the numbers owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items.
