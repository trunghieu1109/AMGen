Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_15
proposed answer: Let x1,x2,x3,x4 be the numbers owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items. We know x2=437, x3=234, x1+x2+x3+x4=900, and the total item‐ownership count is |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=195+367+562+900=2024, which equals 1·x1+2·x2+3·x3+4·x4. Substituting x2,x3 gives x1+x4=229 and x1+4x4=448. Solving yields x4=73.

proposed answer: Let x_i be the number of residents owning exactly i of the four items. We have: total residents =900 so x1+x2+x3+x4=900, and sum of set sizes =195+367+562+900=2024 equals x1+2x2+3x3+4x4. Substituting x2=437, x3=234 gives 2024 = x1+874+702+4x4 => x1=448−4x4, and from x1+x4=900−(437+234)=229 ⇒448−4x4+x4=229 ⇒3x4=219 ⇒x4=73.
