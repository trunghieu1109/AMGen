    <pre>Related original question:

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Determine the number of residents who own all three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) using the number of residents owning exactly two and three items. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent MUK3:
We need counts of residents owning each pair of the three items or the number owning exactly two of the three (R, G, S) to apply inclusion–exclusion and find the triple intersection. That information is missing, so the number owning all three cannot be determined.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent MUK3:
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the sizes of the intersections of each pair among diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts) by using the total number of residents and the results from previous subtasks.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Let x1,x2,x3,x4 be the numbers owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items. We know x2=437, x3=234, x1+x2+x3+x4=900, and the total item‐ownership count is |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=195+367+562+900=2024, which equals 1·x1+2·x2+3·x3+4·x4. Substituting x2,x3 gives x1+x4=229 and x1+4x4=448. Solving yields x4=73.
