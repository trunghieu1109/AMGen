In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "Let x1,x2,x3,x4 be the numbers owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items. We know x2=437, x3=234, x1+x2+x3+x4=900, and the total item\u2010ownership count is |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=195+367+562+900=2024, which equals 1\u00b7x1+2\u00b7x2+3\u00b7x3+4\u00b7x4. Substituting x2,x3 gives x1+x4=229 and x1+4x4=448. Solving yields x4=73.\n\nAnswer:73",
