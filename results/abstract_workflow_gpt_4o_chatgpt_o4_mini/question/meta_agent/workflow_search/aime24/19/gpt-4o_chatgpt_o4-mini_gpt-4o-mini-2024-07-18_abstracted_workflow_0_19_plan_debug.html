    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_k=0^12(2-2\omega^k+\omega^2k)\]
is divided by 1000..

### Sub-task 5: Verify the result by checking calculations and ensuring all properties of roots of unity have been correctly applied. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent daKE:
To verify the result, we re-derive each step: 
1. Note that ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) reduces to (1−(1+i)^{13})(1−(1−i)^{13}) by grouping conjugate pairs and using ω^k terms.  
2. Compute (1+i)^{13}: using polar form, 1+i=√2·e^{iπ/4}, so (1+i)^{13}=(√2)^{13}·e^{i13π/4}=2^{6.5}·e^{i(3π+π/4)}=2^6·√2·e^{iπ/4}·e^{i3π}=64·√2·e^{iπ/4}·(−1)=−64(1+i). Thus (1+i)^{13}=−64−64i.  
3. Its conjugate is (1−i)^{13}=−64+64i.  
4. Then 1−(1+i)^{13}=65+64i, 1−(1−i)^{13}=65−64i.  
5. The product equals |65+64i|^2=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321.  
6. Finally, 8321 mod 1000 = 321.  
All uses of binomial/polar forms, conjugation, and modular reduction are valid.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 8qvN:
We recomputed (1+i)^{13} via both binomial expansion and De Moivre’s theorem: (1+i)=√2·e^{iπ/4} gives (√2)^{13}e^{i13π/4}=(2^{6.5})e^{iπ/4}·e^{i3π}=2^6·√2·e^{i(π/4+π)}=64√2·e^{i5π/4}=64√2·(−(1+i)/√2)=−64−64i. Its conjugate is −64+64i. Then 1−(1+i)^{13}=65+64i and 1−(1−i)^{13}=65−64i. Their product is |65+64i|^2=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321, and 8321≡321 mod 1000. All properties of i and roots of unity cycles hold.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent daKE:
We have confirmed each algebraic and polar-form computation and used the conjugate pairing correctly. The remainder upon division by 1000 is 321.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 8qvN:
Verified: the remainder is 321

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the verified result.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We re-derived the product by pairing ω^k with its conjugate, used De Moivre’s theorem for (1±i)^{13}, computed 1−(1±i)^{13} correctly as 65±64i, and found the product’s modulus squared 65²+64²=8321. Taking mod 1000 gives 321, so the result is consistent and verified.
