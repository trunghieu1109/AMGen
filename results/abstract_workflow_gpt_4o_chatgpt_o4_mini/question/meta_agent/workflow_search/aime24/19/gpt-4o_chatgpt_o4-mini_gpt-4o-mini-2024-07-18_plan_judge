Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_19
proposed answer: We re-derived the product by pairing ω^k with its conjugate, used De Moivre’s theorem for (1±i)^{13}, computed 1−(1±i)^{13} correctly as 65±64i, and found the product’s modulus squared 65²+64²=8321. Taking mod 1000 gives 321, so the result is consistent and verified.

proposed answer: I reviewed each step: factoring 2–2ω^k+ω^{2k} as (ω^k–(1+i))(ω^k–(1–i)), applying ∏_{k=0}^{12}(t–ω^k)=t^{13}–1 to get ∏(ω^k–a)=1–a^{13}, computing (1+i)^{13}=–64–64i (and its conjugate), multiplying (65+64i)(65−64i)=8321, and reducing 8321 modulo 1000 to obtain 321. All root-of-unity properties and arithmetic operations are correctly applied with no inconsistencies.

Answer:Verification confirmed; the steps are consistent and the remainder modulo 1000 is 321.
