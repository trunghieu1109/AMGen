Writing N=d4d3d2d1 (thousands to units), replacing the k-th digit by 1 gives N+(1–d_k)·10^{k–1}.  Requiring each of these four numbers be ≡0 mod 7 yields four modular constraints.; answer: Let N = d4·1000 + d3·100 + d2·10 + d1.  For each k=1,2,3,4 (units up to thousands), replacing d_k by 1 gives the number N_k = N + (1−d_k)·10^{k−1}.  The constraints are:\nFor k=1..4,   N + (1−d_k)·10^{k−1} ≡ 0  (mod 7).\nCoT-SC agent ApR4, generating candidates, thinking: We have four congruences\n  N≡(d₁−1)·1≡(d₂−1)·10≡(d₃−1)·100≡(d₄−1)·1000  (mod 7).\nWriting t=d₁−1≡r (mod 7), one finds\n  d₁=r+1 or r+8 (if ≤9),\n  d₂≡5r+1 (mod 7) or +7 if ≤9,\n  d₃≡4r+1 (mod 7) or +7 if ≤9,\n  d₄≡6r+1 (mod 7) or +7 if ≤9,\nfor some r=0,1,…,6.

Setting N + (1–dk)·10^{k–1} ≡ 0 mod 7 for k=1..4 gives N ≡ (dk–1)·10^{k–1} mod7.
