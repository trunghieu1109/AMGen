    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Determine the greatest four-digit number N from the candidates that satisfies the divisibility condition. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pPgU:
We require for N= d4d3d2d1 that changing any one digit to 1 makes a multiple of 7.  This gives four congruences N≡(d_i−1)·10^{i−1} (mod 7), which force the digit relations d1≡t+1, d2≡5t+1, d3≡4t+1, d4≡6t+1 (mod 7) for some t.  Imposing consistency with N’s actual residue shows t=3, so d4=5, d3=6, d1=4 and d2∈{2,9}.  Checking both candidates 5624 and 5694 gives both valid, and the greatest is 5694.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pPgU:
5694

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the quotient Q and remainder R when N is divided by 1000, and then compute Q + R.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives quotient Q=5 and remainder R=694. Thus Q+R=5+694=699.
