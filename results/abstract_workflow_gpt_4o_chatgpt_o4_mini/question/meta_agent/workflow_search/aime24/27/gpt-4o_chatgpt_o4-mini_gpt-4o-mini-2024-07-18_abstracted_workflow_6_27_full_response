Changing any digit to 1 yields a multiple of 7. That gives four congruences modulo 7, one for each digit position.; answer: Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d with digits a∈{1,…,9}, b,c,d∈{0,…,9}. The constraints are:\n1) Replace thousands digit: (1000·1 + 100b + 10c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n2) Replace hundreds digit: (1000a + 100·1 + 10c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n3) Replace tens digit: (1000a + 100b + 10·1 + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n4) Replace units digit: (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 7)\nCoT-SC agent BAwk, generating candidates, thinking: We derive four linear congruences mod 7 from replacing each digit by 1, solve them to get relations a≡6c, b≡4c+5, d≡3c−2 (mod 7), then enforce all four to find c≡2 mod 7. With 0≤c≤9 that gives c=2 or 9, yielding N=5624 or 5694.; answer: The potential candidates are 5624 and 5694.\nCoT-SC agent AUaI, generating candidates, thinking: We derive congruences from replacing each digit of N=1000a+100b+10c+d with 1 and requiring divisibility by 7. Reducing mod 7 gives a system of four linear congruences which simplifies to 3a+2b≡0, c≡2b+6, d≡c (all mod 7) plus the first congruence 2b+c+d≡1. Testing digit ranges yields only b=4 with a=2 or 9 and c,d∈{0,7}, giving eight candidates.; answer: 2400, 2407, 2477, 2470, 9400, 9407, 9477, 9470\nCoT-SC agent VaJB, generating candidates, thinking: We derive congruences mod 7 for N=1000a+100b+10c+d by replacing each digit with 1 and requiring divisibility by 7. Reducing 1000≡6,100≡2,10≡3 mod 7 gives a system which we solve to express a,b,d in terms of c mod 7, then lift c to its values 0–9.
