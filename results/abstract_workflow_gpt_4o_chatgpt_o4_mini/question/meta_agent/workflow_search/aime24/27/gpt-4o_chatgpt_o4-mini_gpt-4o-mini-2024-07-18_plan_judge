Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_27
proposed answer: We have N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives quotient Q=5 and remainder R=694. Thus Q+R=5+694=699.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_27
proposed answer: We previously determined N = 5694, so Q = 5 and R = 694. Therefore Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.
