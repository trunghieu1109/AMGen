Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_26
proposed answer: We need A such that ∑_{m∈A}2^{m−1}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024 = 2^10+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. So A consists of m=exponent+1, i.e. {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Sum = 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.

Answer:The set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11} and the sum of its elements is 55.
Extracted answer: The set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11} and the sum of its elements is 55.
Correct answer: 055
