    <pre>Related original question:

Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bobs list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the total number of sets B for a given set A and ensure it equals 2024. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CWQh:
From Sub-task 2, each m in A contributes 2^(m−1) finite nonempty sets B with max B=m. Summing over all m∈A gives the total number of sets B, which must match the given total of 2024.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CWQh:
The total number of sets B is ∑_{m∈A}2^{m−1}, and this sum must equal 2024.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Find the set A that satisfies the condition in subtask 3 and calculate the sum of its elements.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We need A such that ∑_{m∈A}2^{m−1}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024 = 2^10+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. So A consists of m=exponent+1, i.e. {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Sum = 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.

Answer:The set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11} and the sum of its elements is 55.</pre>
