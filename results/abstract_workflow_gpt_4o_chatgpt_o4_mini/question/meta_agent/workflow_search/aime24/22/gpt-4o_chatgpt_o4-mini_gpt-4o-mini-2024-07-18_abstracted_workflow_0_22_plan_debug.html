    <pre>Related original question:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: From the lists identified in subtask_2, filter those where the median is a positive integer not present in the list. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent CBU1:
To filter for sub-task 3 we need the explicit candidate lists from sub-task 2. Without those concrete lists (partitions of 30 with unique mode 9 and at least two 9’s), we cannot compute medians and check whether the median is an integer absent from the list. A systematic approach would be: (1) generate all partitions of 30 containing at least two 9’s and ensuring 9 is the unique mode; (2) for each list sort it and compute its median (if even length average the two middle values); (3) select only those whose median is an integer and does not appear among the list elements. But the actual filtering cannot be completed without the candidate lists.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent CBU1:
Sub-task 3: For each list from sub-task 2, sort the entries and compute the median (middle element if odd length, or average of the two middle elements if even length). Then retain only those lists whose median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the candidate lists from sub-task 2 (or generate all partitions of 30 with at least two 9’s where 9 is the unique mode) so we can apply the median filter.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the sum of the squares of the items in the list(s) identified in subtask_3.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

Please provide the list(s) identified in subtask_3 (or generate all partitions of 30 with at least two 9’s where 9 is the unique mode and median is an integer absent from the list) so we can compute the sum of squares.</pre>
