Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We have the simplified fraction as 1/16. Summing numerator and denominator gives 1+16=17.

proposed answer: We attempted to compute the union of the rotation‐constraint sets by inclusion–exclusion, but the pairwise and higher intersections (e.g. requiring no two blues at multiple distances simultaneously) become intricate to count directly. Computing |A_k ∩ A_j| for k≠j involves detailed combinatorial cases that are lengthy to carry out in this format.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please decompose the problem further by enumerating the intersections |A_k ∩ A_j| for each pair of nonidentity rotations and then apply inclusion–exclusion; this will identify the exact size N of valid colorings so you can simplify N/256 and compute m+n.
