Computing |A_k \u2229 A_j| for k\u2260j involves detailed combinatorial cases that are lengthy to carry out in this format.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nPlease decompose the problem further by enumerating the intersections |A_k \u2229 A_j| for each pair of nonidentity rotations and then apply inclusion\u2013exclusion; this will identify the exact size N of valid colorings so you can simplify N/256 and compute m+n.",
