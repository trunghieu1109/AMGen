Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_10
proposed answer: Placed rectangle ABCD with A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16). Rectangle EFGH gives G=(x+184,33), H=(x,33). Imposing that A(0,0), D(0,16), H, G are concyclic yields x=3. Thus E=(3,16), so CE = 107 - 3 = 104.

proposed answer: We set up coordinates: Rectangle ABCD with A=(0,16),D=(0,0),C=(107,0). Rectangle EFGH has E=(e,0),F=(e+184,0),G=(e+184,–17),H=(e,–17). Points A,D,H,G must be concyclic. The circle through A(0,16) and D(0,0) has center y=8. Enforcing equal distances from the center to H and G yields the quadratic 23e^2+4232e–12903=0, whose positive root is e=3. Hence E=(3,0) and C=(107,0) so CE=|107–3|=104.
