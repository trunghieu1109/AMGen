Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent AsKt', content='Placed rectangle ABCD with A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16). Rectangle EFGH gives G=(x+184,33), H=(x,33). Imposing that A(0,0), D(0,16), H, G are concyclic yields x=3. Thus E=(3,16), so CE = 107 - 3 = 104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
