    <pre>Related original question:

Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Apply geometric theorems or properties to find relationships between the segments. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent r2OQ:
We know rectangles give equal opposite sides and right angles, so diagonals AC and EG length can be expressed via Pythagorean theorem. The cyclic quadrilateral ADHG yields Ptolemy’s relation among its four sides. We also note the supplementary opposite angles but the main algebraic relation comes from Ptolemy.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent r2OQ:
The key segment‐length relations are:
1. Diagonals of the rectangles:
   AC = √(AB² + BC²) = √(107² + 16²) = √11705,
   EG = √(EF² + FG²) = √(184² + 17²) = √34145.
2. By Ptolemy’s theorem on cyclic quadrilateral ADHG:
   AD·HG + DH·AG = AH·DG  ⇒ 16·184 + DH·AG = AH·DG.
3. In cyclic ADHG, opposite angles are supplementary: ∠ADH + ∠AGH = 180°.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the length of CE using the relationships and derived equations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We set up coordinates: Rectangle ABCD with A=(0,16),D=(0,0),C=(107,0). Rectangle EFGH has E=(e,0),F=(e+184,0),G=(e+184,–17),H=(e,–17). Points A,D,H,G must be concyclic. The circle through A(0,16) and D(0,0) has center y=8. Enforcing equal distances from the center to H and G yields the quadratic 23e^2+4232e–12903=0, whose positive root is e=3. Hence E=(3,0) and C=(107,0) so CE=|107–3|=104.
