    <pre>Related original question:

Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?.

### Sub-task 2: Use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals to establish relationships between the sides and angles of the quadrilateral ADHG. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent wa0S:
In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary and equal inscribed angles subtend the same arc. We invoke these facts on ADHG to relate its angles, using also the right–angle information from the rectangles.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent wa0S:
In cyclic quadrilateral ADHG:
1. Opposite angles sum to 180°: ∠A + ∠H = 180° and ∠D + ∠G = 180°.
2. Equal inscribed angles: ∠ADH = ∠AGH (both subtend arc AH) and ∠AHG = ∠ADG (both subtend arc AG).

In particular, since ∠H = 90° (rectangle EFGH), ∠A = 180°–90° = 90°, so AD ⟂ AH as required; and similarly ∠G = 180°–∠D, linking D’s right angle at the line DEC to the angle at G.

### Sub-task 3: Apply the properties of collinearity to the points D, E, C, F to understand the linear relationship between these points. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9SlG:
Since D, E, C, F are collinear they lie on one straight line.  Hence the directed segments satisfy
    
    
D→E + E→C + C→F = D→F,
    
i.e. the lengths add (up to sign) along the line.  Equivalently,
    
    DE + EC + CF = DF,
    
and the slopes of DE, EC, CF are all equal.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9SlG:
Since D, E, C, F are collinear, DE + EC + CF = DF; the points lie on a single straight line so directed segments add.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the length of segment CE using the established relationships from the cyclic quadrilateral and collinear points.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Placed rectangle ABCD with A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16). Rectangle EFGH gives G=(x+184,33), H=(x,33). Imposing that A(0,0), D(0,16), H, G are concyclic yields x=3. Thus E=(3,16), so CE = 107 - 3 = 104.
