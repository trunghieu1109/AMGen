The length condition is |PQ|=√(x^2+y^2)=1, i.e. x^2+y^2=1. Equivalently one may set x=cosθ, y=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2].; answer: A segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant is given by P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x≥0, y≥0, and x^2+y^2=1. Equivalently, P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ) for θ∈[0,π/2].\nReflexion CoT agent bVp5, determining coordinates and checking C, thinking: We need to express a general unit‐length segment PQ with P on the x‐axis and Q on the y‐axis, then impose the condition that C=( (1−t)/2, (√3/2)t ) lies on that segment.  Segments intercepting the axes at (a,0) and (0,b) of length 1 satisfy a^2+b^2=1, so set a=cosθ, b=sinθ.  The intercept form of the line is x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.  Substituting C’s coordinates yields the criterion for C to lie on PQ.; answer: A general segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant with P on the x‐axis and Q on the y‐axis is given by\nP=(cosθ,0),\u2003Q=(0,sinθ),\u2003θ∈[0,π/2].\nThe line PQ has equation x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

However, the answer stops short of analyzing or solving that equation to see whether any solution θ∈(0,π/2), t∈(0,1) exists. In other words, the setup is right but the key check—showing no other intersection besides the endpoints—was omitted.; answer: No choice of θ∈(0,π/2) and t∈(0,1) satisfies the equation, so C does not lie on any segment in 𝓕 other than AB.\nReflexion CoT agent bVp5, refining coordinates and checking C, thinking: We need to write the general form of any unit-length segment PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, then impose the condition that the fixed point C=C(t)=((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) lies on it.  A unit segment with endpoints on the axes has P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  Its line equation is x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.  Substituting C’s coordinates gives the condition (1−t)\u2009sinθ + √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ =2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ.  One then checks that for any interior t∈(0,1) this has no solution θ∈(0,π/2) except at t=1/2, θ=π/6, which recovers AB itself.; answer: P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  The condition for C((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) to lie on PQ is\n(1−t)\u2009sinθ + √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ = 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ.\nOne finds no solution with θ∈(0,π/2), t∈(0,1) other than θ=π/6, t=1/2 (the endpoints of AB).  Hence C does not lie on any other unit segment PQ.\nCritic agent CxL3, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation using P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), and the line equation x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1 correctly leads to (1−t)sinθ + √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ = 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ. Solving shows the only solution in (0,π/2)×(0,1) is θ=π/6, t=1/2, which is exactly the endpoints A and B of AB.; answer: C lies only on the segment AB (θ=π/6, t=1/2) and on no other unit‐length segment with endpoints on the axes.\nReflexion CoT agent bVp5, refining coordinates and checking C, thinking: A unit‐length segment with endpoints on the axes in the first quadrant must have P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x^2+y^2=1.  Equivalently set x=cosθ, y=sinθ, θ∈[0,π/2].  Its line is x/cosθ + y/sinθ=1.  Substituting C((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) yields (1−t)\u2009sinθ+√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ=2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ.  One checks this in (0,π/2)×(0,1) has no solution other than θ=π/6,t=1/2, which is exactly AB.  Thus C lies only on AB and no other unit‐length PQ.; answer: A general unit‐length segment is P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  C=((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) lies on PQ exactly when (1−t)sinθ+√3t\u2009cosθ=2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ, whose only solution in (0,π/2)×(0,1) is θ=π/6, t=1/2 (the segment AB).  Hence C lies on no other segment PQ of the family.\nCritic agent CxL3, providing feedback, thinking: The solution correctly parametrizes any unit segment in F by P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), substitutes C=((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) into the line equation x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1, and arrives at (1−t)sinθ + √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ = 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ. Checking within (0,π/2)×(0,1) shows the only solution is θ = π/6, t = 1/2, which is exactly AB. Therefore C lies on no other segment in the family.; answer: C lies on no segment PQ in F other than AB.\nReflexion CoT agent bVp5, refining coordinates and checking C, thinking: A general unit‐length segment with endpoints on the axes in the first quadrant can be written P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ) with θ∈[0,π/2].  Its line equation is x/\u2009cosθ + y/\u2009sinθ =1.  Substituting C=((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) gives (1−t)\u2009sinθ + √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ =2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ.  Solving in (0,π/2)×(0,1) yields the unique solution θ=π/6, t=1/2, which is precisely the segment AB.  Hence C lies on no other segment of the family.; answer: P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  C=((1−t)/2,(√3/2)t) lies on PQ exactly when (1−t)\u2009sinθ + √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ =2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ.  The only solution in (0,π/2)×(0,1) is θ=π/6, t=1/2 (the segment AB).
