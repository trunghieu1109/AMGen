    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac12,0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac\sqrt32\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcalF\) be the family of segments \(\overlinePQ\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overlineAB\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcalF\) other than \(\overlineAB\). Then \(OC^2=\tfracpq\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Find the coordinates of point C on AB that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Bm3P:
We find C as the unique envelope point of unit‐length chords from (t,0) to (0,√(1−t²)) by intersecting y=(1−x^{2/3})^{3/2} with line AB: y=−√3 x+√3/2. Solving yields x=(1/2)^3=1/8 and y=−√3·(1/8)+√3/2=3√3/8.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Bm3P:
C\bigl(1/8,\,3\sqrt3/8\bigr)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate OC^2 and express it in the form p/q, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers, and find p+q.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Point C is at (1/8,3√3/8). Then OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
