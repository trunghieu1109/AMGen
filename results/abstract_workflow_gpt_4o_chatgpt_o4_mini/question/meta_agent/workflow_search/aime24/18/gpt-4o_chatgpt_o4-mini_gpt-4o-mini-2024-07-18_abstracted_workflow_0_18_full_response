Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

Thus p²+q²=1 with p,q≥0.  Parameterizing by p=t, we get q=√(1−t²) for t∈[0,1], yielding all such segments.; answer: The family F is all segments PQ with P=(t,0), Q=(0,√(1−t²)), for 0≤t≤1, so that |PQ|=1.\nCoT-SC agent uQay, identifying family of segments F, thinking: We need to describe all unit‐length segments with one endpoint on the x‐axis and the other on the y‐axis.  If P=(p,0) and Q=(0,q), then PQ=1 gives p^2+q^2=1 with p,q≥0.  Equivalently parameterize by θ in [0,π/2]: P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ).; answer: The family F is all segments from P=(p,0) to Q=(0,q) with p,q≥0 and p^2+q^2=1.  Equivalently, for θ∈[0,π/2], P=(cosθ,0) and Q=(0,sinθ).\nCoT-SC agent 1rnE, identifying family of segments F, thinking: We require P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y) in the first quadrant such that length PQ = sqrt((x-0)^2+(0-y)^2)=1. Thus x^2+y^2=1 with x,y≥0. Parameterizing x in [0,1], y=√(1−x^2).; answer: The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 with P=(x,0) and Q=(0,√(1−x^2)) for 0≤x≤1 (equivalently x^2+y^2=1, x,y≥0).\nReflexion CoT agent Bm3P, finding coordinates of point C, thinking: To find C we note it is the envelope point of the 1-length chords PQ from (t,0) to (0,√(1−t²)). The envelope of these lines is y=(1−x^{2/3})^{3/2}. Intersecting with AB: y=−√3 x+√3/2 gives (1−x^{2/3})^{3/2}=√3(1/2−x).

It also satisfies the envelope condition y=(1−x^{2/3})^{3/2} for unit‐length chords PQ, making it the unique “hidden” point. Its coordinates are bounded by 0<x<1/2 and 0<y<√3/2, so C is interior to segment AB and not an endpoint.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8), with 0<1/8<1/2 and 0<3√3/8<√3/2 (interior of AB).\nReflexion CoT agent Bm3P, refining coordinates of point C, thinking: We find C by intersecting the envelope of unit‐length chords, y=(1−x^{2/3})^{3/2}, with line AB (y=−√3 x+√3/2).
