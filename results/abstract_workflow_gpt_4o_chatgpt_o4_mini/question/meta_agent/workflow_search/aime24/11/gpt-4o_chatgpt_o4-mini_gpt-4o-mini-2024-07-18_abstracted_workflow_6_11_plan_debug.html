    <pre>Related original question:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy]. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Count the number of paths from subtask_2 that satisfy the condition of changing direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Kfr4:
Sub-task 2 counted all paths of length 16 from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 4 direction changes. Using runs: 5 runs means either starting with R or U. For start R: partition 8 rights into 3 positive parts (C(7,2)=21) and 8 ups into 2 positive parts (C(7,1)=7), giving 147. Similarly for start U gives another 147, total 294.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Kfr4:
294

### Sub-task 4: Verify the count by considering symmetry and other combinatorial properties of the grid paths. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PWmy (yourself):
To verify 294, note that any such path has exactly 5 runs of moves and may start with R or U. By symmetry the counts for starting R and starting U are equal.  If it starts with R, there are 3 runs of Rs summing to 8 (positive integers) and 2 runs of Us summing to 8.  The number of positive‐integer solutions is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 for the Rs and C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7 for the Us, giving 21·7=147.  Doubling for the two start‐directions yields 2·147=294, matching the previous count.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PWmy (yourself):
By symmetry and stars‐and‐bars: 2·[C(7,2)·C(7,1)]=2·(21·7)=294, confirming the count.

### Review and validate the path count. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 9cWa:
The symmetry argument splitting into paths that start with R or U and using stars-and-bars for the 3 R-runs summing to 8 and 2 U-runs summing to 8 is sound. Computing C(7,2)=21 and C(7,1)=7 gives 147 per start, doubling yields 294.

### Sub-task 4: Verify the count by considering symmetry and other combinatorial properties of the grid paths. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PWmy (yourself):
To verify the count, note each path with exactly four turns has exactly five runs of moves and can start with either R or U. By symmetry, counts for paths starting R or U are equal. If it starts with R, there are three R‐runs summing to 8 and two U‐runs summing to 8. The number of positive‐integer solutions for the R‐runs is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21, and for the U‐runs is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7, giving 21·7=147. Doubling for both start‐directions yields 2·147=294, confirming the count.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PWmy (yourself):
By symmetry and stars‐and‐bars: 2·[C(7,2)·C(7,1)] = 2·(21·7) = 294, confirming the result.

### Review and validate the path count. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent 9cWa:
The verification using symmetry and stars-and-bars is correct, yielding 2·C(7,2)·C(7,1)=294.

### Sub-task 4: Verify the count by considering symmetry and other combinatorial properties of the grid paths. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PWmy (yourself):
To verify the count, observe that any path with exactly four turns consists of five runs of moves and can start with either R (right) or U (up). By symmetry the number of paths starting with R equals those starting with U. If a path starts with R, there are three R-runs summing to 8 steps and two U-runs summing to 8 steps. The number of positive solutions for the R-runs is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 and for the U-runs is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7, giving 21·7=147. Doubling for both start‐directions yields 2·147=294, confirming the original count.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PWmy (yourself):
By symmetry and stars-and-bars: 2·[C(7,2)·C(7,1)] = 2·(21·7) = 294, confirming the count.

### Review and validate the path count. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent 9cWa:
The stars-and-bars symmetry argument is sound, yielding 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1)) = 294.
