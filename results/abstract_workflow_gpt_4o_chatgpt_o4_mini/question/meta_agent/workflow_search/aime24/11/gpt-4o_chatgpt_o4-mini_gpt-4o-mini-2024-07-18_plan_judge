Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: Each of the two alternating patterns (H–V–H–V–H and V–H–V–H–V) yields 147 valid paths. Summing these gives 147 + 147 = 294.

proposed answer: To verify the count, observe that any path with exactly four turns consists of five runs of moves and can start with either R (right) or U (up). By symmetry the number of paths starting with R equals those starting with U. If a path starts with R, there are three R-runs summing to 8 steps and two U-runs summing to 8 steps. The number of positive solutions for the R-runs is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 and for the U-runs is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7, giving 21·7=147. Doubling for both start-directions yields 2·147=294, confirming the original count.

Answer:By symmetry and stars-and-bars: 2·[C(7,2)·C(7,1)] = 2·(21·7) = 294, verifying the result.
