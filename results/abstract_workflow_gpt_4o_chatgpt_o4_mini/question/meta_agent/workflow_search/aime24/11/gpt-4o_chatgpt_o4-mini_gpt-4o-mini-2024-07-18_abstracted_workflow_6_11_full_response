Such a sequence has 5 runs. If it starts with R, the pattern is R-U-R-U-R: 3 R-runs sum to 8 (compositions C(7,2)=21) and 2 U-runs sum to 8 (C(7,1)=7), giving 21×7=147.

A path with 4 turns has 5 runs of consecutive moves, alternating between R and U. There are two cases: starting with R (pattern R–U–R–U–R) or starting with U (pattern U–R–U–R–U). In the first case, the 3 R-runs (positive lengths summing to 8) can be chosen in C(7,2)=21 ways and the 2 U-runs in C(7,1)=7 ways, giving 147. The second case is symmetric, also 147.
