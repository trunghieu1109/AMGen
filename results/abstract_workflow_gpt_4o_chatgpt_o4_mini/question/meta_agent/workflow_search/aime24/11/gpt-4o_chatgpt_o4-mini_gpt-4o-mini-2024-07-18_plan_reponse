        "response": "To verify the count, observe that any path with exactly four turns consists of five runs of moves and can start with either R (right) or U (up). By symmetry the number of paths starting with R equals those starting with U. If a path starts with R, there are three R-runs summing to 8 steps and two U-runs summing to 8 steps. The number of positive solutions for the R-runs is C(8\u22121,3\u22121)=C(7,2)=21 and for the U-runs is C(8\u22121,2\u22121)=C(7,1)=7, giving 21\u00b77=147. Doubling for both start-directions yields 2\u00b7147=294, confirming the original count.\n\nAnswer:By symmetry and stars-and-bars: 2\u00b7[C(7,2)\u00b7C(7,1)] = 2\u00b7(21\u00b77) = 294, verifying the result.",
