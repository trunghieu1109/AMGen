Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

However, it holds only under those specific constraints: x,y,z must be positive and satisfy log_2(x/(yz))=1/2, log_2(y/(xz))=1/3, log_2(z/(xy))=1/4. Outside that system (or for non-positive variables, other log bases, or additional degrees of freedom), the result does not apply.; answer: x^4y^3z^2=2^{-25/8}; it is valid exclusively for the unique positive solution of the given log-equations and requires x,y,z>0.\nReflexion CoT agent QERg, refining expression of x^4y^3z^2, thinking: We substitute x=2^{-7/24}, y=2^{-3/8}, z=2^{-5/12} into x^4y^3z^2.
