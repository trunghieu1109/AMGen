    <pre>Related original question:

Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left(x \over yz\right) = 1 \over 2\]\[\log_2\left(y \over xz\right) = 1 \over 3\]\[\log_2\left(z \over xy\right) = 1 \over 4\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Find the sum m+n where m and n are the relatively prime integers found in subtask_4. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent S2PC:
From subtask 4 we have |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = 25/8 so m = 25 and n = 8, which are relatively prime. Their sum is 25 + 8 = 33.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent VDSA:
From subtask 4 we have m=25 and n=8, so their sum is 25+8=33.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent S2PC:
33

### answer #3 by Debate Agent VDSA:
33

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on sum m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
