Thus each given equation converts directly to an exponential relation expressing each variable in terms of the other two.; answer: x = 2^(1/2) * y * z; y = 2^(1/3) * x * z; z = 2^(1/4) * x * y\nCoT-SC agent vGsg, solving system of equations, thinking: We convert to logs u=log2x, v=log2y, w=log2z. From x=2^{1/2}yz gives u=1/2+v+w, etc. Solve the linear system: u−v−w=1/2, −u+v−w=1/3, −u−v+w=1/4. Summing gives u+v+w=−13/12. Substituting back yields u=−7/24, v=−3/8=−9/24, w=−5/12=−10/24. Hence x=2^{−7/24}, y=2^{−9/24}, z=2^{−10/24}. Dividing through by z gives x:y:z=2^{3/24}:2^{1/24}:1, i.e. 2^{1/8}:2^{1/24}:1.; answer: x=2^{−7/24}, y=2^{−3/8}, z=2^{−5/12}; hence x:y:z=2^{1/8}:2^{1/24}:1\nCoT-SC agent x4Ph, solving system of equations, thinking: We use the relations x=2^{1/2}yz, y=2^{1/3}xz, z=2^{1/4}xy. Multiply them to get 1/(xyz)=2^{1/2+1/3+1/4}=2^{13/12}, so xyz=2^{-13/12}. Substitute back: x^2=2^{1/2-13/12}=2^{-7/12}, so x=2^{-7/24}; y^2=2^{1/3-13/12}=2^{-3/4}, so y=2^{-3/8}; z^2=2^{1/4-13/12}=2^{-5/6}, so z=2^{-5/12}.; answer: x=2^{-7/24}, y=2^{-3/8}, z=2^{-5/12}\nCoT-SC agent D9XQ, solving system of equations, thinking: We have the three relations x=2^{1/2}yz, y=2^{1/3}xz, z=2^{1/4}xy.  Multiply them to find xyz=2^{-(1/2+1/3+1/4)}=2^{-13/12}.  Then from x=2^{1/2}yz and yz=(xyz)/x we get x^2=2^{1/2-13/12}=2^{-7/12}, so x=2^{-7/24}.  Similarly y^2=2^{1/3-13/12}=2^{-3/4}, so y=2^{-3/8}, and z^2=2^{1/4-13/12}=2^{-5/6}, so z=2^{-5/12}.; answer: x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12)\nReflexion CoT agent T9o6, expressing x^4y^3z^2, thinking: We substitute x=2^{-7/24}, y=2^{-9/24}, z=2^{-10/24} into x^4y^3z^2: exponent = 4(-7/24)+3(-9/24)+2(-10/24) = (-28-27-20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8, so x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}.; answer: x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\nCritic agent efBg, providing feedback, thinking: The expression x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8} is correctly obtained by substituting x = 2^{-7/24}, y = 2^{-9/24}, z = 2^{-10/24} and collecting exponents. It is fully simplified under the assumption that x, y, z are the unique positive solutions of the given base-2 logarithmic system.

The exponent sum is 4(−7/24)+3(−9/24)+2(−10/24)= (−28−27−20)/24=−75/24=−25/8, so x^4y^3z^2=2^{−25/8}.; answer: x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\nCritic agent efBg, providing feedback, thinking: The expression x^4y^3z^2=2^{−25/8} is correctly obtained by substituting the unique positive solutions x=2^{−7/24}, y=2^{−9/24}, z=2^{−10/24} and summing exponents (−28−27−20)/24=−75/24=−25/8.

Summing exponents: 4(-7/24)+3(-9/24)+2(-10/24)=(-28-27-20)/24=-75/24=-25/8, hence x^4y^3z^2=2^{-25/8}.; answer: x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\nCritic agent efBg, providing feedback, thinking: The expression x^4y^3z^2=2^{-25/8} is exact under the assumption that x,y,z>0 and satisfy the given logarithmic relations. Its validity is limited to this specific system; changing the log bases or relaxing positivity invalidates it. Also, numerical evaluation hinges on exact rational exponents and would need adjustment if the system’s constraints change.; answer: 2^{-25/8}\nReflexion CoT agent T9o6, refining expression of x^4y^3z^2, thinking: We substitute x=2^{−7/24}, y=2^{−9/24}, z=2^{−10/24} into x^4y^3z^2 and sum exponents: 4(−7/24)+3(−9/24)+2(−10/24) = (−28−27−20)/24 = −75/24 = −25/8, yielding x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{−25/8}.; answer: x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\nReflexion CoT agent 2l9v, computing |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|, thinking: From subtask 3 we have x^4y^3z^2=2^{−25/8}, so log_2(x^4y^3z^2)=−25/8 and its absolute value is |−25/8|=25/8.; answer: 25/8\nCritic agent 4xFq, providing feedback, thinking: The computation correctly shows that x^4y^3z^2=2^{-25/8}, so |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|=25/8. However, this conclusion depends entirely on the prior solution for x,y,z—if any step in deriving those values is flawed, the final exponent would be wrong. Additionally, it assumes x,y,z>0 (so all logarithms are valid) and that the system admits a unique positive solution, which should be verified to ensure the result is well-defined.; answer: 25/8\nReflexion CoT agent 2l9v, refining computation of |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|, thinking: From sub-task 3 we have x^4y^3z^2=2^{-25/8}. Taking log base 2 gives log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = -25/8, so the absolute value is 25/8.; answer: 25/8\nCritic agent 4xFq, providing feedback, thinking: The value |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)| follows directly from x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}, giving log_2(...)= -25/8 and hence |–25/8| = 25/8. This is correct under the assumption that x, y, z are the unique positive solutions of the original system. A key limitation is that it depends entirely on the prior derivation of x^4y^3z^2; any error or ambiguity in solving for x, y, z (e.g., overlooking sign conventions or multiple branches) would affect this result. Additionally, it assumes all logarithms are real and that the variables remain positive throughout.; answer: 25/8\nReflexion CoT agent 2l9v, refining computation of |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|, thinking: From x^4y^3z^2=2^{−25/8}, we have log_2(x^4y^3z^2)=−25/8, so its absolute value is 25/8.; answer: 25/8\nCritic agent 4xFq, providing feedback, thinking: The computed value |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|=25/8 is numerically correct under the assumption that the three logarithmic equations combine directly to log₂(x⁴y³z²)=–25/8. However, this shortcut has limitations:\n1. No step-by-step derivation of x, y, z is shown, so there’s no check that all original equations are satisfied simultaneously.\n2. The positivity of x,y,z (required for all logarithms) isn’t explicitly used in the combination step.\n3. One must verify that 25 and 8 are relatively prime, which they are, but this check is omitted.\nTo fully justify the result, one should solve for x,y,z or at least outline how the exponent sum –25/8 arises from the given system and confirm domain conditions.; answer: 25/8\nReflexion CoT agent 2l9v, refining computation of |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|, thinking: From Sub-task 3 we have x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{−25/8}.
