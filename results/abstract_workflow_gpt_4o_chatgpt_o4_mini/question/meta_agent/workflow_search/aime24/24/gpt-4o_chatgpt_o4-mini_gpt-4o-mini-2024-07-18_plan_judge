Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_24
proposed answer: From previous subtasks we found |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = 25/8 so m = 25, n = 8. They are relatively prime, and their sum is 25 + 8 = 33.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_3_24
proposed answer: Both Debate Agents agree that |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| = 25/8, giving m=25, n=8 and thus m+n=33. This directly answers Sub-task 5.
