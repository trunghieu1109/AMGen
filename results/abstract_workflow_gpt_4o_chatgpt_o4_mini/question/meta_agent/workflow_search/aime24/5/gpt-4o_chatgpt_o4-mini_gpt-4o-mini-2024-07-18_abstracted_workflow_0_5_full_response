Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

Here all four faces are triangles with side‐lengths {√41,√80,√89}. Checking one face: √80+√41≈15.347>√89≈9.433, √80+√89≈18.377>√41≈6.403, and √41+√89≈15.836>√80≈8.944. Thus each face is a valid triangle. Since opposite edges are equal, this is a disphenoid tetrahedron and its Cayley–Menger determinant is positive, so a real tetrahedron exists.; answer: Yes. The side lengths satisfy the necessary triangle inequalities on each face (all faces have sides √41, √80, √89) and opposite edges are equal, so they do form a tetrahedron.\nCoT-SC agent jL0L, determining vertex coordinates, thinking: To find coordinates one can place A at (0,0,0), B on the x‐axis, C in the xy‐plane and solve distance equations for C and D. The resulting expressions, especially the z‐coordinate of D, become extremely unwieldy radicals. Without computational algebra, simplifying these by hand is error‐prone, so I mark this subtask as too hard in closed form.; answer: A=(0,0,0)\nB=(√41,0,0)\nC=(16/√41,12√21/√41,0)\nD=(25/√41,556√41/(123√21),√(10758400/317709))\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggest placing ABC in a coordinate plane, then solving sphere‐intersection equations with a computer algebra system or breaking into smaller steps to simplify the z‐coordinate of D.\nCoT-SC agent tBdV, determining vertex coordinates, thinking: To place the tetrahedron with edges AB=√41, AC=√80, AD=√89, BC=√89, BD=√80, CD=√41, we fix A at the origin and B on the x–axis, then solve for C in the xy–plane and finally D in xyz–space.  This yields explicit but rather messy radical coordinates for C and D.  Because writing them in fully simplified radical form is lengthy, I will give the standard construction and leave the full simplification for a more detailed breakdown.; answer: One convenient choice is:  \nA=(0,0,0)  \nB=(√41,0,0)  \nSolve for C=(u,v,0) by  u²+v²=80  and  (u−√41)²+v²=89, which gives  u=16/√41,  v=12√(21/41).  \nThen let D=(p,q,r) and solve  p²+q²+r²=89,  (p−√41)²+q²+r²=80  and  (p−u)²+(q−v)²+r²=41.  One finds  p=25/√41,  q=2224/(41·v),  r=√(v²−q²).  \n[TOO_HARD]  \nPlease confirm if you would like a fully simplified radical form for q and r or a step-by-step coordinate‐solving breakdown.\nCoT-SC agent y3nD, determining vertex coordinates, thinking: Determining explicit coordinates requires solving a system of nonlinear equations that lead to very complicated nested radicals. While the method is clear—place three vertices in a convenient plane and then find the fourth by intersecting three spheres—the final expressions are unwieldy. It is better to split into sub-steps: first locate C in the plane of A and B, then solve for D.; answer: Place B at (0,0,0) and A at (√41,0,0).  Then solve for C=(u,v,0) via\n  u^2+v^2=89,\n  (u−√41)^2+v^2=80,\nwhich yields u=25/√41, v=√(3024/41).\nNext solve for D=(x,y,z) by\n  x^2+y^2+z^2=80,\n  (x−√41)^2+y^2+z^2=89,\n  (x−25/√41)^2+(y−√(3024/41))^2+z^2=41.\nThe resulting radicals are extremely cumbersome.\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggest first computing C in the xy-plane, then finding D by intersecting three spheres around A, B, and C.\nReflexion CoT agent uGVi, identifying condition for equidistant point, thinking: The incenter of a tetrahedron is defined by equal perpendicular distances to all four faces.

We can embed its vertices to compute volume and face area.  Setting opposite edges AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89, one finds coordinates giving volume V=160/3.  A face has side lengths √41,√80,√89, so by Heron its area is 6√21.  The total surface area is 4·6√21=24√21.
