    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt41$, $AC=BD= \sqrt80$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt89$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\fracm \sqrt np$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the expression form. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent yXDR:
We have r=20√21/63 with m=20, n=21 squarefree, p=63 and gcd(20,63)=1, so it already matches the required form m√n/p.

### answer by Final Decision Agent yXDR:
20√21/63

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n + p from the expression obtained.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
