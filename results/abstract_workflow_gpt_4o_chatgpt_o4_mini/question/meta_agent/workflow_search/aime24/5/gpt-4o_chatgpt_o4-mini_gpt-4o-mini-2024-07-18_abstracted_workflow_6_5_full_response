Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

Next, compute the Cayley–Menger determinant\n|0   1      1      1      1    |\n|1   0     41     80     89    |\n|1  41      0     89     80    |\n|1  80     89      0     41    |\n|1  89     80     41      0    |\nand find it positive (numerator = 12 951 449 600 > 0), so the volume is real and nonzero.  Hence the six lengths do form a valid (nondegenerate) tetrahedron.; answer: Yes.  They satisfy all triangle inequalities on the faces and the Cayley–Menger determinant is positive, so a nondegenerate tetrahedron exists.\nCoT agent qd0I, identifying properties for equidistant point, thinking: To have a point equidistant from all four faces, the tetrahedron must admit an insphere (be tangential).  A necessary and sufficient condition for a tetrahedron to be tangential is that the sums of the areas of opposite faces are equal, or equivalently that its opposite edges are pairwise equal (an “isosceles” tetrahedron).  In our case AB=CD, AC=BD, and AD=BC, so the tetrahedron is isosceles and hence has an insphere.  Its incenter is then the unique point equidistant from all faces.; answer: The tetrahedron satisfies AB=CD, AC=BD, and AD=BC, so all opposite edges are equal.  This makes it an isosceles (tangential) tetrahedron, which therefore admits an insphere and hence has a point (the incenter) equidistant from all four faces.\nCoT agent TLNW, calculating inradius, thinking: We need the inradius r for the isosceles tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: AB²=CD²=41, AC²=BD²=80, AD²=BC²=89.  For an isosceles tetrahedron, volume² can be found via the Cayley–Menger (or a known symmetric formula):\n Let u²=41, v²=80, w²=89.  Set A=v²+w²−u²=128, B=w²+u²−v²=50, C=u²+v²−w²=32.  Then\n 288·V² = 4u²v²w² − u²A² − v²B² − w²C² + ABC\n =1 167 680 −(671 744+200 000+91 136)+204 800 =409 600,\n so V²=409 600/288=12 800/9 and V=80√2/3.\nAll four faces are congruent triangles with side lengths √41,√80,√89.
