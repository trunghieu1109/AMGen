Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_6
proposed answer: From the result r^2 = 657/64 we identify p = 657 and q = 64, giving p + q = 721.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_6
proposed answer: We have the smallest box diagonal squared D² = (27171–4032√6)/529, so the sphere radius squared is r² = D²/4 = (27171–4032√6)/2116. This expression is irrational, so it cannot be written as a simple p/q with integer p,q, and hence we cannot form p+q as requested without further clarification.

Answer:(27171–4032√6)/2116
[TOO_HARD]
The result is irrational due to √6, so we cannot form a rational p/q and sum p+q. Please clarify if a different extremum or rationalization step is intended.
