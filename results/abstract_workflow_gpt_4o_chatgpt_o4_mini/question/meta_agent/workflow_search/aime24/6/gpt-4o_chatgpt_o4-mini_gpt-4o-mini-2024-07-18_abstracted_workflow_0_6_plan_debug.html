    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Find the sum of p and q from the fraction obtained. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 7MCf:
Given that r^2 = 657/64, we identify p = 657 and q = 64, so p + q = 721.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 3kVL:
From r² = 657/64, we have p = 657 and q = 64. Summing gives p + q = 721.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 7MCf:
721

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 3kVL:
721

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on sum of p and q.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
