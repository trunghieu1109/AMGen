        "response": "We have the smallest box diagonal squared D\u00b2 = (27171\u20134032\u221a6)/529, so the sphere radius squared is r\u00b2 = D\u00b2/4 = (27171\u20134032\u221a6)/2116. This expression is irrational, so it cannot be written as a simple p/q with integer p,q, and hence we cannot form p+q as requested without further clarification.\n\nAnswer:(27171\u20134032\u221a6)/2116\n[TOO_HARD]\nThe result is irrational due to \u221a6, so we cannot form a rational p/q and sum p+q. Please clarify if a different extremum or rationalization step is intended.",
