    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 3: Determine the smallest diagonal length from all the diagonals calculated in subtask_2, as this will correspond to the smallest sphere that can contain any of the boxes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SD5c:
We seek the minimum of the box diagonal D=√(l²+w²+h²) subject to lw+lh+wh=27 and lwh=23. By symmetry one extremum occurs when two sides equal, say l=w=x and h=y. The constraints become x²+2xy=27 and x²y=23.  Solving x²y=23 gives y=23/x².  Substituting into x²+2x·(23/x²)=27 yields the cubic x³–27x+46=0, whose positive roots are x=2 and x=−1+2√6.  The first gives D²=41.0625; the second gives the smaller D²=(27171–4032√6)/529.  Hence the smallest diagonal is √[(27171–4032√6)/529]=√(27171–4032√6)/23.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent SD5c:
√(27171–4032√6)/23

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the square of the radius of the smallest sphere (half of the smallest diagonal) and express it as a fraction in simplest form. Then, find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have the smallest box diagonal squared D² = (27171–4032√6)/529, so the sphere radius squared is r² = D²/4 = (27171–4032√6)/2116. This expression is irrational, so it cannot be written as a simple p/q with integer p,q, and hence we cannot form p+q as requested without further clarification.

Answer:(27171–4032√6)/2116
[TOO_HARD]
The result is irrational due to √6, so we cannot form a rational p/q and sum p+q. Please clarify if a different extremum or rationalization step is intended.</pre>
