    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compute the difference between the radii of tangency circles (r_i - r_o). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent fZhT:
Sub-task 5 gives r_o = 9 and Sub-task 6 gives r_i = 3, so r_i - r_o = 3 - 9 = -6.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent fZhT:
-6

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Simplify the fraction and calculate m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The correct radii of the two tangency circles are r_i=33/4 and r_o=33/7, giving r_i−r_o=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m=99, n=28 and m+n=127.
