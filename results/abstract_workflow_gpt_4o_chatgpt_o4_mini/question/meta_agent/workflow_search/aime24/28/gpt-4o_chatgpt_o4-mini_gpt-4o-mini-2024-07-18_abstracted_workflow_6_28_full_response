Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

From the original problem, the sphere S is given to have radius 11. Thus its only dimension is that its radius equals 11.; answer: The sphere S is a sphere of radius 11.\nReflexion CoT agent btp2, determining external tangency conditions, thinking: We parametrize the torus (major radius 6, minor radius 3) by angles (t,φ) as\n x=(6+3\u2009cos\u2009t)\u2009cos\u2009φ, y=(6+3\u2009cos\u2009t)\u2009sin\u2009φ, z=H+3\u2009sin\u2009t,\nwhere H is the vertical displacement of the torus axis above the sphere center.  The squared distance from the sphere center (0,0,0) to a torus point is\n F(t)=(6+3\u2009cos\u2009t)^2+(H+3\u2009sin\u2009t)^2.\nExternal tangency requires that F achieves its minimum value 121 with zero derivative at that t.  Setting F'(t)=0 gives tan\u2009t=H/6.  Writing u=√(H^2+36), the condition F_min=121 leads to u=8 and hence H^2=28.  Taking H>0 gives H=2√7 and cos\u2009t=6/u=3/4.  The circle of tangency lies at radius r=6+3\u2009cos\u2009t, so r_o=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.; answer: External tangency occurs when the torus is shifted up by H so that the minimum distance from the sphere center to its surface just equals the sphere radius (121 after squaring) and the derivative vanishes.  Solving gives H=2√7 and the contact circle satisfies cos\u2009t=3/4, hence r_o=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.\nCritic agent fbpQ, providing feedback, thinking: External tangency is found by aligning the torus so that the global minimum of the distance from the sphere’s center to the torus surface equals the sphere’s radius.  In a meridional cross‐section one writes\nd(t)² = (6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009t)² + (H + 3\u2009sin\u2009t)²,\nthen imposes d′(t)=0 and d_min² = 11² = 121.  Solving gives H = 2√7, cos\u2009t = 3/4, and hence the contact circle’s radius r_o = 6 + 3·(3/4) = 33/4.\n\nLimitations of this approach:\n•  We assume the stationary point in the meridional slice is the global minimum on the full torus surface.  A local extremum could fail if another crest of the tube is closer.\n•  We require H > 3 so the torus does not intersect the sphere (here H = 2√7 ≈ 5.29 > 3).  If the sphere were smaller or larger, the same t-equation might not yield a physically valid H.\n•  This calculation treats only one cross‐section; one must check there are no off‐meridian tangencies ignored by the 2D reduction.\n; answer: r_o = 33/4\nReflexion CoT agent btp2, refining external tangency conditions, thinking: To find external tangency when the torus rests on the sphere, we align their axes vertically at a height H so that the minimum distance from the sphere center to the torus surface equals the sphere radius (11) and that point is a stationary point on the torus tube.  In a meridional cross‐section we set d²(t)=(6+3 cos t)²+(H+3 sin t)², impose d′(t)=0 ⇒ tan t=H/6, and require d_min²=121 ⇒ H=2√7 and cos t=3/4.  The circle of contact then has radius r_o=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.; answer: External tangency occurs when the torus axis is raised by H=2√7 so that the closest meridional point satisfies tan t=H/6 and d_min=11.  Solving gives cos t=3/4, hence the circle of tangency has radius r_o=33/4.\nCritic agent fbpQ, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation correctly identifies the vertical alignment and finds H=2√7 and r_o=33/4, but it does not explicitly verify that this stationary point is the global minimum distance (i.e., that no other point on the torus intersects the sphere), nor does it account for physical stability or frictional constraints of the torus on the sphere.; answer: External tangency occurs when the torus’s central axis is lifted by H=2√7 above the sphere’s center so that tan\u2009t = H/6 (t = arctan(√7/3)), giving cos\u2009t = 3/4 and circle of tangency radius r_o = 6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009t = 33/4. This configuration holds provided 2√7 ≥ 3 (so the torus does not penetrate the sphere) and assumes ideal rigid bodies without deformation or slip constraints.\nReflexion CoT agent btp2, refining external tangency conditions, thinking: To find external tangency, align the torus axis vertically above the sphere center by height H so that the closest point on the torus tube both is a stationary point in the meridional cross‐section and lies at distance 11 from the sphere center.  In that cross‐section set d²(t)=(6+3 cos t)²+(H+3 sin t)², impose d′(t)=0 ⇒ tan t=H/6, and require d_min=11 ⇒ H=2√7, cos t=3/4.  The circle of contact then has radius r_o = 6+3·(3/4) = 33/4.; answer: External tangency occurs when the torus axis is raised by H=2√7 so that the global minimum distance from the sphere center to the torus surface is 11, yielding cos t=3/4 at the contact point.  The circle of tangency has radius r_o = 33/4.\nCritic agent fbpQ, providing feedback, thinking: The computation correctly minimizes the distance function d²(t) = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009t)² + (H + r\u2009sin\u2009t)² to find H = 2√7 and hence r_o = 33/4. However, it omits the crucial geometric restriction that an external tangency on the outside can only occur when the sphere’s radius S is at least the sum of the torus’s central‐circle radius R and its tube‐radius r (i.e. S ≥ R + r = 9 in this problem). If S < R + r the torus would intersect the sphere rather than just touch externally, and no such minimum‐distance configuration exists outside.; answer: External tangency on the outside requires S ≥ R + r. One minimizes d²(t) = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009t)² + (H + r\u2009sin\u2009t)², giving tan\u2009t = H/R and the condition √(H² + R²) + r = S. Solving yields H = √((S−r)² − R²). For R = 6, r = 3, S = 11 this gives H = 2√7, cos\u2009t = R/√(H² + R²) = 6/8 = 3/4, and therefore r_o = R + r\u2009cos\u2009t = 6 + 3·(3/4) = 33/4.\nReflexion CoT agent btp2, refining external tangency conditions, thinking: To find external tangency on the outside, we require that the sphere’s radius S be at least the sum of the torus’s major radius R and minor radius r (so S ≥ R + r = 9).  We then align their axes vertically by a height H so that the global minimum of the distance from the sphere center to the torus surface equals S, and that point is stationary in the meridional cross‐section.  Writing d²(t) = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009t)² + (H + r\u2009sin\u2009t)² and imposing d′(t)=0 and d_min=S, we get tan\u2009t=H/R and H=2√7 with cos\u2009t=3/4.  The contact circle then has radius R + r\u2009cos\u2009t = 6 + 3·(3/4) = 33/4.; answer: External tangency on the outside occurs only if the sphere radius S ≥ R + r.  Align the axes so the closest torus point is at distance S, giving H=2√7 and cos\u2009t=3/4.  The radius of the circle of tangency is r_o = 33/4.\nReflexion CoT agent G8qV, determining internal tangency conditions, thinking: To find the inner‐contact circle we place the torus (major R=6, minor r=3) coaxially inside the sphere (radius 11) so their centers lie on the z–axis, separated by h.  Points of tangency satisfy both surfaces’ equations and have parallel normals.  Writing ρ²+z²=11² and (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=3² and enforcing normal‐vector parallelism gives\n ρ=(33/7) or ρ=(33/4).\nThe smaller value ρ=33/7 arises when the torus lies inside the sphere.  Hence r_i=33/7.; answer: 33/7\nCritic agent 967R, providing feedback, thinking: The provided answer skips key details of the normal‐vector parallelism step (sign choices, ensuring only the smaller root gives an interior contact circle), and it omits verifying that the resulting ρ lies within the torus’ minor‐radius bounds. These gaps limit its rigor and clarity.; answer: Set up:\n1. Torus: (ρ–6)^2+(z–h)^2=3^2\n2. Sphere: ρ^2+z^2=11^2\n3. Normals parallel ⇒(ρ–6)/ρ=(z–h)/z ⇒h=6z/ρ\nSubstitute h into (1) and use (2) to eliminate z, yielding the quadratic whose only physically valid solution is ρ=33/7.\nReflexion CoT agent G8qV, refining internal tangency conditions, thinking: We place the torus (major radius R=6, minor radius r=3) coaxially inside the sphere of radius 11 so both centers lie on the z–axis separated by a distance h. A point of tangency (in cylindrical coords ρ,z) must satisfy the sphere’s equation ρ²+z²=11², the torus’s generating‐circle equation (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=3², and the condition that the normals ∇(ρ²+z²–121) and ∇((ρ–6)²+(z–h)²–9) are parallel. Solving these simultaneously yields ρ=33/7 for the inner tangency circle.; answer: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere when their axes coincide and there exists a point (ρ,z) satisfying both ρ²+z²=121 and (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=9 with parallel surface normals. Under these conditions, the radius of the circle of tangency on the inside is r_i=33/7.\nCritic agent 967R, providing feedback, thinking: The outline correctly sets up the sphere equation ρ²+z²=11², the torus generating‐circle equation (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=3², and enforces parallel normals. One limitation is that you must also check that the sphere radius S=11 exceeds the sum of the torus’s major and minor radii (R+r=9) to allow the torus to sit entirely inside. Additionally, one should verify that the solved value of h is real and places the generating circle fully within the sphere.; answer: Under coaxial alignment with R=6, r=3 and S=11>R+r, solving the simultaneous equations with normal‐parallelism yields the circle of internal tangency radius r_i=33/7.\nReflexion CoT agent G8qV, refining internal tangency conditions, thinking: We place the torus (major radius R=6, minor radius r=3) and the sphere (radius 11) so their symmetry axes coincide (coaxial). Let the centers be separated by h on this axis. A point of contact in cylindrical coordinates (ρ,z) must satisfy both the sphere’s equation ρ²+z²=11² and the torus generating‐circle equation (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=3², and the normals ∇(ρ²+z²–121) and ∇((ρ–6)²+(z–h)²–9) must be parallel. Solving these simultaneously (and checking that 11>R+r so the torus fits inside) yields the inner tangency circle radius ρ=r_i=33/7.; answer: Conditions: the torus and sphere share a common axis, the sphere’s center is at distance h from the torus’s circle‐center so that there is a solution (ρ,z) to\r\n  ρ²+z²=121,\r\n  (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=9,\r\nwith parallel normals, and the sphere’s radius exceeds R+r=9 so the torus lies entirely inside. Under these conditions, the radius of the inner circle of tangency is r_i=33/7.\nCritic agent 967R, providing feedback, thinking: Internal tangency conditions:\n1. Coaxial alignment: the axis of revolution of the torus (major radius R=6, minor radius r=3) coincides with the radius of the sphere (radius S=11).\n2. Enclosure condition: the sphere must fully contain the torus, so S > R + r (here 11 > 6 + 3 = 9).\n3. Existence of a circle of contact: there must be a solution (ρ, z) to\n   • ρ² + z² = S² = 121,\n   • (ρ – R)² + (z – h)² = r² = 9,\n   with the normals ∇(ρ² + z² – 121) and ∇((ρ – R)² + (z – h)² – 9) parallel.\n4. Real‐valued radius: the resulting contact circle radius ρ must lie in [0, R].\n\nLimitations:\n– If S = R + r, the torus and sphere touch at a single point (ρ = 0) rather than along a circle.\n– If S < R + r, no internal tangency occurs (the sphere is too small to enclose the torus).\n– If the required center‐separation h exceeds S + r, the torus lies completely outside the sphere with no intersection.\n– The contact circle radius ρ = 33/7 ≈ 4.714 must satisfy 0 ≤ ρ ≤ R = 6; if R were smaller, the computed ρ would not be admissible.; answer: r_i = 33/7\nReflexion CoT agent G8qV, refining internal tangency conditions, thinking: We align the torus (major radius R=6, minor radius r=3) and sphere (radius S=11) coaxially. A point of internal tangency must satisfy the sphere’s equation ρ²+z²=11², the torus generating‐circle equation (ρ–6)²+(z–h)²=3², and have parallel normals. Also S>R+r=9 to fully enclose the torus. Solving these yields the tangency circle radius ρ=r_i=33/7.; answer: Conditions for internal tangency:\n1. Coaxial alignment: the torus’s axis (circle center to axis) and the sphere’s radius line coincide.\n2. Enclosure: sphere radius S=11 exceeds R+r=6+3=9 so the torus fits inside.\n3.
