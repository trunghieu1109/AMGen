Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

By definition, the distance from the center of the tube to the axis of revolution is the major radius (R), and the radius of the tube is the minor radius (r). Thus R=6 and r=3.; answer: The major radius is 6 and the minor radius is 3.\nCoT agent Lkyl, determining sphere properties, thinking: The problem statement specifies that the sphere S has radius 11.; answer: 11\nCoT agent eAJw, identifying external tangency conditions, thinking: We place the torus so its symmetry axis is vertical and at distance d from the sphere’s center.  The torus surface comes as close to that axis as R–r and as far as R+r.  For the sphere of radius S to be exactly tangent to the torus externally, its surface must meet the torus at one of those extremal distances.  Hence either the inner side of the tube touches (d – (R–r)=S) or the outer side does (d + (R+r)=S).; answer: Let d be the distance from the sphere’s center to the torus’s axis.  External tangency occurs exactly when either\n1) d – ( R – r ) = S  (inner‐tube contact), or\n2) d + ( R + r ) = S  (outer‐tube contact).\nCoT agent hA0y, identifying internal tangency conditions, thinking: To derive the internal‐tangency conditions, let d = distance from the torus’s center of revolution to the sphere’s center.  The torus has tube radii R±r from its center.  For the sphere of radius S to be tangent to the torus from the inside, the furthest and nearest points on the torus must lie exactly on the sphere surface.  Thus we set d + (R + r) = S for tangency at the outer rim of the tube, and d + (R - r) = S for tangency at the inner rim.  We also require 0≤d≤S−(R+r) so that the torus lies entirely inside the sphere.; answer: Let R=6, r=3, S=11 and d the center‐to‐center distance.  Internal tangency occurs iff one of these holds:\n1) d + (R + r) = S  (outer‐rim tangency)\n2) d + (R − r) = S  (inner‐rim tangency)\nwith 0 ≤ d ≤ S − (R + r).\nCoT agent uaWu, calculating external tangency radius, thinking: For external tangency the sphere touches the outermost circle of the tube, which lies at θ=0 so its distance from the torus axis is R+r=6+3=9.; answer: 9\nCoT agent DkfG, calculating internal tangency radius, thinking: Internal tangency occurs when the sphere just touches either the outer or inner rim of the torus.  Those rims lie at distances R+r and R−r from the axis of revolution.
