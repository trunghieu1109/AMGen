Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: For each of the 45 pairs (N1,N2) summing to 999 we have digits A+B+C=8, and D=9–A, E=9–B, F=9–C so the column‐numbers X=10A+D=9A+9, Y=9B+9, Z=9C+9 always satisfy X+Y+Z=9(A+B+C)+27=99. Hence all 45 pairs yield valid grids.

proposed answer: We need all 2×3 grids of digits a,b,c (top row) and d,e,f (bottom) such that the two 3-digit numbers abc + def = 999 and the three 2-digit column numbers ad + be + cf = 99. Writing a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 from the first sum digit‐wise, and 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99 yields 9(a+b+c)=72 so a+b+c=8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45, and each determines d,e,f uniquely in [0,9].
