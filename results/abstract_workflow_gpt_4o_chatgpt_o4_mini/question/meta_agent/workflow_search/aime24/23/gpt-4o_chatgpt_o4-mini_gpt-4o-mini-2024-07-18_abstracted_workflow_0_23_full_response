Writing S_a=a1+a2+a3 and S_b=b1+b2+b3, the column sum condition is 10S_a+S_b=99. But from B=999–A one has b_i=9–a_i so S_b=27–S_a. Hence 10S_a+27–S_a=99 ⇒ 9S_a=72 ⇒ S_a=8.

Thus a can be any integer from 1 to 8 (a=0 gives a one-digit number 09 which is not 2-digit). For each a, d=9−a, giving 2-digit number 10a+d=9a+9.

The second-column two-digit number BE=10B+E=10B+(9–B)=9B+9. B ranges from 0 to 8 (since A+B+C=8 allows any B in 0..8), giving BE = 9,18,27,…,81, interpreted as two-digit grid values 09,18,…,81.; answer: 09, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81\nCoT agent WlXT, identifying 2-digit numbers from third column, thinking: We model the 2×3 grid cells as digits a,b,c in the first row and d,e,f in the second. The row‐sum condition 100(a+b+c)+100(d+e+f)=999 forces column sums a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. The vertical sum condition 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99 then reduces to a+b+c=8, so c runs from 0 to 8. The third‐column number is 10c+f=10c+(9−c)=9c+9. For c=0…8 this yields 9,18,27,…,81.
