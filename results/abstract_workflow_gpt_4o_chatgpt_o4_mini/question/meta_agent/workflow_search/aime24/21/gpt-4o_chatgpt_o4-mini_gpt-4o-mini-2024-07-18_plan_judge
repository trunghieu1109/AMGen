Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_21
proposed answer: From sub-task 4, for each of the 60 vertex pairs (i<j, j−i≠6) there are 2 rectangles, yielding 60×2=120 rectangles.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_21
proposed answer: Based on the exhaustive check of all 12 choose 4 quadruples with the isRectangle function—which enforces equal bisected diagonals and thus perpendicular adjacent sides—together with the fact that each side‐span k or 6−k lies in {1,2,3,4,5}, all rectangles counted are valid and lie inside the dodecagon. This yields a total of 27.
