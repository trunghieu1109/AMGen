    <pre>Related original question:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the number of ways to fill the grid with the maximum number of chips determined in stage 1, ensuring that any additional chip would violate the constraints. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent kcol:
To achieve 25 chips we need r₁c₁+r₂c₂=25 with r₁+r₂=5, c₁+c₂=5. Only solutions are (r₁=5,c₁=5) or (r₁=0,c₁=0), giving all-white or all-black fills. That&#39;s 2 configurations.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent kcol:
2

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Aggregate the results from subtask 3 to find the total number of valid configurations for placing the chips on the grid.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
