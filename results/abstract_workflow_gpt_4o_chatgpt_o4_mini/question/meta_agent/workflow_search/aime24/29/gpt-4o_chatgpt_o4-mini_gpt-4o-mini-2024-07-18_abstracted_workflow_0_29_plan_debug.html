    <pre>Related original question:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the total number of valid configurations by considering all possible combinations of chip placements that satisfy the constraints. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent QjVW:
Each valid configuration arises by choosing a colour for each of the 5 rows and 5 columns (2^5 × 2^5 choices) and then filling exactly the cells where row and column colours agree. The available 25 chips of each colour suffice for any such maximal configuration.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent dRQn:
Each valid maximal configuration is obtained by choosing a color (white or black) for each of the 5 rows and each of the 5 columns, then filling exactly those cells where the row and column colors agree. This gives 2^5 × 2^5 = 2^10 = 1024.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent QjVW:
1024

### answer #3 by Debate Agent dRQn:
1024

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on total number of valid configurations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Each valid maximal configuration arises by independently choosing one of two colors (white or black) for each of the 5 rows and for each of the 5 columns, and then placing chips exactly in those cells where the row and column colors agree. This uses at most 25 chips of each color and is maximal. Hence the count is 2^5 × 2^5 = 1024.
