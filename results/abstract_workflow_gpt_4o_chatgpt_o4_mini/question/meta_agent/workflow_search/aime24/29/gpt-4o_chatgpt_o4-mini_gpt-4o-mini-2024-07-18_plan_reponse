Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.",

        "response": "Each valid maximal configuration arises by independently choosing one of two colors (white or black) for each of the 5 rows and for each of the 5 columns, and then placing chips exactly in those cells where the row and column colors agree. This uses at most 25 chips of each color and is maximal. Hence the count is 2^5 \u00d7 2^5 = 1024.\n\nAnswer:1024",
