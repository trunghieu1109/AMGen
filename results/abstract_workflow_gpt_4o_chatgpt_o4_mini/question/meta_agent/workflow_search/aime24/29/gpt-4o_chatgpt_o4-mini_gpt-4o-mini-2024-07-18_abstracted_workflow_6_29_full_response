Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Equivalently we color some rows white or black (others empty) and some columns white or black (others empty), and we only place white chips at intersections of white rows×white columns and black chips at black rows×black columns.  Any other occupied cell would force two colors in its row or column, and any omission in a matched intersection is allowed (it doesn’t break the uniformity condition).; answer: All such configurations arise as follows:\n1. Choose disjoint subsets Rw,Rb⊆{1,…,5} of rows to be white or black (rows not chosen carry no chips).\n2. Choose disjoint subsets Cw,Cb⊆{1,…,5} of columns to be white or black (others empty).\n3. Place a white chip in any subset of the |Rw|×|Cw| intersections and a black chip in any subset of the |Rb|×|Cb| intersections.  No chips are placed elsewhere.\n\nThese are exactly the placements for which every nonempty row or column is monochromatic.\nCoT-SC agent hvB2, determining max chips, thinking: We partition rows into Rw (size a) and Rb (size c) and columns into Cw (size b) and Cb (size d) with a+c≤5 and b+d≤5. White chips fill Rw×Cw (area ab), black fill Rb×Cb (area cd), so total chips = ab + cd. Maximizing ab + cd under these constraints gives 25 by taking a=5, b=5, c=d=0 (or vice versa). Splitting between colors yields smaller totals.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent 2ClX, determining max chips, thinking: We maximize rw·cw + rb·cb subject to rw+rb ≤5, cw+cb ≤5. The maximum is achieved by taking all rows and columns one color, e.g. rw=5, cw=5, giving 25 chips.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent NAX3, determining max chips, thinking: We model configurations by choosing r₁ white rows, r₂ black rows (r₁+r₂=5) and c₁ white columns, c₂ black columns (c₁+c₂=5).  Chips fill all intersections of same‐color rows×columns, so total chips f=r₁c₁+r₂c₂.  Writing r₂=5−r₁, c₂=5−c₁ gives f=2r₁c₁−5r₁−5c₁+25, maximized at (r₁,c₁)=(5,5) or (0,0), yielding f=25.; answer: 25\nCoT agent kcol, calculating ways to fill grid, thinking: To achieve 25 chips we need r₁c₁+r₂c₂=25 with r₁+r₂=5, c₁+c₂=5.
