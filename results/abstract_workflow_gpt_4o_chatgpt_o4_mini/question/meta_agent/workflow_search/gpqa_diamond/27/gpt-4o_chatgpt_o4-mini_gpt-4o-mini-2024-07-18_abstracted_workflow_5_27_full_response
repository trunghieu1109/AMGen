The double bond between C2–C3 conjugates with the C1 ketone, making an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The hydroxy at C4 is allylic to the double bond and is the only stereocenter, designated S by the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rules.; answer: (S)-4-Hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is a six-membered cyclohexene ring bearing an α,β-unsaturated ketone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one) and an allylic secondary alcohol at C4. The ring contains a C=C between C2 and C3, a carbonyl at C1, and a hydroxyl at the stereogenic C4 center with S-configuration. Its functional groups are an enone (conjugated ketone) and an allylic alcohol.\nCoT agent pDor, applying transformation to form product 1, thinking: Treatment with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine converts the free allylic OH into its tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether, protecting the alcohol while leaving the α,β-unsaturated ketone intact.; answer: (S)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\nCoT agent QGSl, applying transformation to form product 2, thinking: The silyl-protected enone undergoes 1,4-conjugate addition of phenyl from Ph2CuLi at C3, generating an enolate at C2, which is then alkylated by benzyl bromide to install the benzyl group at C2. The TBS ether at C4 remains intact.; answer: (S)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-benzyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\nCoT agent xvxX, applying transformation to form product 3, thinking: LDA selectively deprotonates the ketone at C6 to form the enolate, which is then methylated by iodomethane, introducing a methyl group at C6 while retaining the TBS protection and existing substituents.; answer: (S)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-benzyl-3-phenyl-6-methylcyclohexan-1-one\nCoT agent 0nZ8, applying transformation to form final product 4, thinking: Treatment with aqueous HCl cleaves the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether at C4, restoring the free hydroxyl. All other stereocenters and substituents remain unchanged.; answer: (S)-4-hydroxy-2-benzyl-3-phenyl-6-methylcyclohexan-1-one\nCoT agent oYz2, analyzing features of product 4, thinking: Starting from S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, C4 OH is protected, then 1,4-addition of Ph2CuLi installs a phenyl at C3, followed by benzylation at C2. LDA/MeI introduces a methyl at C6 with inversion, and aqueous HCl deprotects C4 OH. All original stereocenters are retained: C2 S, C3 R (from conjugate addition), C4 S (original), C6 S (methylation).; answer: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\nCoT agent QiDT, assessing impact of transformations, thinking: Each step modifies the substrate in a predictable way and sets new stereocenters while preserving existing ones. 1) Protection of the C4‐OH by TBDMS chloride and Et3N converts the alcohol into a silyl ether, preventing unwanted side reactions; no change in stereochemistry at C4. 2) Conjugate (1,4) addition of Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl at C3 and generates an enolate at C1; the addition is anti to the substituent and sets C3 with R configuration. 3) Trapping the enolate with benzyl bromide alkylates C2 via an SN2‐type process, installing the benzyl group in the S configuration. 4) Treatment with LDA deprotonates the α‐position (C6) of the ketone selectively, and subsequent methylation with MeI installs a methyl with S stereochemistry. 5) Aqueous HCl removes the TBDMS group, restoring the C4 hydroxyl with its original S configuration.
