Thus t ≈ 1.02062×50\u2009s ≈ 51.03\u2009s.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9AyF:\n51.03 s\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy\'s reference frame using the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy and the time duration in the Galaxy\'s reference frame.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent zInT, identifying parameters, thinking: The sub-task asks to identify the known quantities provided in the problem statement: the speed of the Galaxy center relative to the ejecta and the elapsed proper time in the ejecta frame.; answer: Velocity v = 60,000 km/s; proper time Δτ = 50 s.\nCoT-SC agent jqIl, determining velocity, thinking: Relative velocities in inertial frames are symmetric in magnitude: if the galaxy moves toward the ejecta at 60 000 km/s in the ejecta’s frame, then in the galaxy’s frame the ejecta moves toward the galaxy at the same speed.; answer: Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy center is 60 000 km/s.\nCoT-SC agent 558d, determining velocity, thinking: Relative velocities are symmetric in inertial frames. If the Galaxy center moves at 60 000 km/s toward the ejecta in the ejecta’s frame, then the ejecta moves at 60 000 km/s away from the Galaxy center in the Galaxy frame.; answer: 60 000 km/s\nCoT-SC agent Q2tM, determining velocity, thinking: The relative velocity between two inertial frames is symmetric, so if the Galaxy center moves at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy frame.; answer: Velocity of ejecta relative to the Galaxy center is 60,000 km/s.\nCoT agent 9AyF, applying time dilation, thinking: We use time dilation: t = γτ with γ = 1/√(1−β²), β = v/c = 60000/300000 = 0.2, so γ ≈ 1.02062.
