Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_132
proposed answer: We have initial concentrations [H2PO4–] = 0.007345 mol/0.200 L = 0.03673 M and [HPO42–] = 0.005618 mol/0.200 L = 0.02809 M. Using Henderson–Hasselbalch with pKa2 = –log(6.2×10–8) = 7.208, pH = 7.208 + log(0.02809/0.03673) ≈ 7.09, so [H+] ≈ 8.11×10–8 M. Then [PO43–] = Ka3·[HPO42–]/[H+] = (1.8×10–12)(0.02809)/(8.11×10–8) ≈ 6.24×10–7 M.

Answer:6.24x10^-7 M

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_132
proposed answer: We use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation for the H2PO4–/HPO42– buffer: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO42–]/[H2PO4–]) ≃ 7.21 + log(0.02810/0.03673) = 7.095 → [H+] ≃ 8.02×10^–8 M. Then apply K3 = [H+][PO43–]/[HPO42–] to solve for [PO43–] = (K3·[HPO42–])/[H+] ≃ (1.8×10^–12·0.02810)/8.02×10^–8 ≃ 6.3×10^–7 M, which corresponds to choice B).
