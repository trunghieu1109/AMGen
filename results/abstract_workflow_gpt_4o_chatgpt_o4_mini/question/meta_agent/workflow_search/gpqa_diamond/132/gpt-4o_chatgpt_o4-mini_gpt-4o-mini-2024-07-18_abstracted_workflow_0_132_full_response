KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4–; Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO42–. In solution, H2PO4– and HPO42– exist in acid–base equilibrium (H2PO4– ⇌ HPO42– + H+), so trace H+ and OH– (from water autoionization) are also present. Negligible amounts of H3PO4 and PO43– form under these conditions.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent XvQU:\nK+, Na+, H2PO4–, HPO42–, plus H+ and OH–\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Apply the equilibrium constants (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) for H3PO4 to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent m7B6, calculating moles of KH2PO4, thinking: To find moles of KH2PO4, divide its mass by molar mass: n = 1.00 g / 136.09 g·mol⁻¹ ≈ 0.00735 mol.; answer: 0.00735 mol\nCoT agent fEPr, calculating moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O, thinking: To find moles, divide mass by molar mass: n = 1.00 g / 177.99 g·mol⁻¹ ≈ 0.00562 mol.; answer: 0.00562 mol\nCoT agent 3lSg, determining total volume, thinking: To convert 200.00 cm³ to liters, divide by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³).; answer: 0.20000 L\nCoT agent 5Q1d, calculating initial concentration of KH2PO4, thinking: We have moles of KH2PO4 = 0.00735 mol and volume = 0.200 L.
