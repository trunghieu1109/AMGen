    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.&#39;, choice1=&#39;5.48x10^-7 M &#39;, choice2=&#39;6.24x10^-7 M&#39;, choice3=&#39;2.81x10^-7 M&#39;, choice4=&#39;3.97x10^-7 M &#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Analyze the dissociation of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in water to determine the species present in the solution. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent XvQU:
KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O are strong electrolytes that fully dissociate in water. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4–; Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO42–. In solution, H2PO4– and HPO42– exist in acid–base equilibrium (H2PO4– ⇌ HPO42– + H+), so trace H+ and OH– (from water autoionization) are also present. Negligible amounts of H3PO4 and PO43– form under these conditions.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent XvQU:
K+, Na+, H2PO4–, HPO42–, plus H+ and OH–

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Apply the equilibrium constants (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) for H3PO4 to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have initial concentrations [H2PO4–] = 0.007345 mol/0.200 L = 0.03673 M and [HPO42–] = 0.005618 mol/0.200 L = 0.02809 M. Using Henderson–Hasselbalch with pKa2 = –log(6.2×10–8) = 7.208, pH = 7.208 + log(0.02809/0.03673) ≈ 7.09, so [H+] ≈ 8.11×10–8 M. Then [PO43–] = Ka3·[HPO42–]/[H+] = (1.8×10–12)(0.02809)/(8.11×10–8) ≈ 6.24×10–7 M.
