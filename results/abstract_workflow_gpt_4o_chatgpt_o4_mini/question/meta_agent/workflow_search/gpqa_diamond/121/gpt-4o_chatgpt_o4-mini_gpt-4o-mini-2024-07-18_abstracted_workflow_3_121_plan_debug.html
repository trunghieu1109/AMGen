    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)&#39;, choice1=&#39;12&#39;, choice2=&#39;10&#39;, choice3=&#39;5&#39;, choice4=&#39;8&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Analyze the structure of the final product 4 to identify all distinct hydrogen environments. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent v49H:
The final product is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane. The ring is monosubstituted at C1, giving three pairs of non-equivalent axial/equatorial protons at C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4 (one axial, one equatorial). This yields 2+2+2=6 distinct ring proton environments. The ethyl ester contributes two more sets (OCH2 and CH3). Total = 8.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent v49H:
8

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Count the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
