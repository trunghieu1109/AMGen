proposed answer: The molecule EtO2C–CH(CN)–(CH2)5–CH(CN)–CO2Et is symmetric, giving one ethyl CH3 environment, one ethyl OCH2, one CH(CN) methine, and three distinct CH2 sets in the pentamethylene linker, for a total of 6 distinct 1H environments. However, since 6 is not among the given choices, clarification is needed.

Answer:6
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify if any CH2 groups in the pentamethylene linker are coincidentally equivalent due to additional symmetry or conformational averaging.
Extracted answer: 6
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: The final product is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane. The cyclohexane ring, monosubstituted at C1, has 6 distinct H environments: C2/C6 axial and equatorial, C3/C5 axial and equatorial, and C4 axial and equatorial. The ethyl ester adds 2 more (OCH2 and CH3), totaling 8 distinct 1H signals.
