Acetic acid is first converted to its mixed anhydride with Ac2O, pyridine traps HBr, giving the mixed anhydride of bromoacetic acid and acetic acid: BrCH2CO–OCOCH3.; answer: mixed anhydride of bromoacetic acid and acetic acid (BrCH2CO–OCOCH3)\nCoT-SC agent RPPR, analyzing reaction to determine product 2, thinking: The mixed anhydride BrCH2CO–OCOCH3 upon treatment with ethanol and H2SO4 undergoes esterification at the bromoacetyl end to give ethyl bromoacetate, releasing acetic acid.; answer: Ethyl bromoacetate\nCoT-SC agent Rd5S, analyzing reaction to determine product 2, thinking: The mixed anhydride BrCH2CO–OCOCH3 reacts with ethanol under acidic conditions via esterification at the bromoacetyl moiety, yielding ethyl bromoacetate and acetic acid.; answer: ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt)\nCoT-SC agent IGYC, analyzing reaction to determine product 2, thinking: The mixed anhydride BrCH2CO–OCOCH3 in acid and ethanol will undergo esterification at both acyl sites; ethanol preferentially forms ethyl bromoacetate from the BrCH2CO– portion (with ethyl acetate as a byproduct). Thus product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate.; answer: ethyl bromoacetate\nCoT agent ZWNP, analyzing reaction to determine product 3, thinking: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt) undergoes an SN2 reaction with CN–, displacing Br to give ethyl cyanoacetate.; answer: Ethyl cyanoacetate\nCoT agent 6FqB, analyzing reaction to determine final product 4, thinking: Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate. NaH deprotonates the methylene between the ester and nitrile, giving a carbanion that undergoes SN2 at both ends of 1,5-dibromopentane. Two molecules of 3 bridge the pentane to give a symmetrical diester with nitrile substituents at the α-positions to each ester.; answer: EtO2C-CH(CN)-(CH2)5-CH(CN)-CO2Et\nDebate agent T9lz, round 0, identifying distinct hydrogen environments, thinking: The molecule is symmetric with two identical ethyl ester ends and a central pentamethylene bridge. Labeling: EtO–CH(CN) at each end (two CH’s equivalent), CH2’s in the bridge are in three distinct sets (α to CH, next to that, and central), plus the ethyl CH2 and CH3.
