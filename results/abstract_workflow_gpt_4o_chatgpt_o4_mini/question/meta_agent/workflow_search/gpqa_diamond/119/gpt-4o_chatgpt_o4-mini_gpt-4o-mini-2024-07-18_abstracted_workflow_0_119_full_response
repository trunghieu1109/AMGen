Since plx=1/d we have dd=−1/plx^2 d(plx). Thus the number per unit parallax N(plx)∝d^2×|dd/d(plx)|∝(1/plx^2)×(1/plx^2)=1/plx^4.; answer: N(plx) ~ 1/plx^4\nCoT-SC agent vrJa, determining distribution in terms of parallax, thinking: Stars uniformly distributed implies constant spatial density. Number in shell between distances d and d+dd is ∝ d^2 dd.
