Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_21
proposed answer: Standard reduction potentials: E°(O₂/H₂O)=1.23 V in acid (pH 0) vs ≈0.40 V in base (pH 14), so O₂ is thermodynamically weaker in basic solutions. Kinetics of the four-electron O₂ reduction are sluggish in acidic media, hence slower in acid.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_21
proposed answer: Thermodynamically, O₂ is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (higher pH lowers potential via Nernst equation). Kinetically, O₂ reduction is slower in acidic media (proton availability and overpotential effects). This matches “weaker – slower.”
