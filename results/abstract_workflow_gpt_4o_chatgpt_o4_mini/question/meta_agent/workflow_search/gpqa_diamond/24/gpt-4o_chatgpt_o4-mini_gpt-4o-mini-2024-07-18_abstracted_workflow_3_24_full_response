The base-induced [2,3]-sigmatropic shift of an allylic benzyl ether to give an allylic alcohol is the Wittig (2,3-) rearrangement.; answer: A: Pinacol rearrangement; B: [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement\nCoT agent LAj5, thinking: The user wants typical reactants and products for the pinacol rearrangement and the [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement. These are well-known classical examples, so no additional request marking is needed.; answer: A) Pinacol rearrangement: typical reactant is a vicinal diol (e.g., 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol) treated with strong acid (H₂SO₄); product is the corresponding ketone (e.g., 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone).  B) [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement: typical reactant is an allylic ether (e.g., allyl phenyl ether) treated with BuLi followed by protonation; product is a homoallylic alcohol (e.g., 4-phenyl-2-buten-1-ol).\nCoT agent z379, thinking: We need a vicinal diol for the pinacol rearrangement (A) and an allylic ether for the [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement (B).
