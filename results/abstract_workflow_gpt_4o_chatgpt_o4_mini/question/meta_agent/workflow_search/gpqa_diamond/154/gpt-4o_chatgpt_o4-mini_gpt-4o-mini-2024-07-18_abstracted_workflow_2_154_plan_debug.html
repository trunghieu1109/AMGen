    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, choice1=&#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, choice3=&#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated uncertainty ΔPz with the given choices to determine the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent AZYi:
We have ⟨Pz⟩=0 and ⟨Pz²⟩=ħ²/2, so ΔPz=√(ħ²/2)=ħ/√2. Comparing with the choices yields option C).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 0d6U:
From previous subtasks we have ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 and ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/2, so ΔPz = √(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2, which corresponds to choice C).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 7Qol:
We have ⟨Pz⟩=0 and ⟨Pz²⟩=ħ²/2 so ΔPz=√(ħ²/2)=ħ/√2, matching choice C).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent XVIh:
Using the computed values ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 and ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/2 yields ΔPz = √(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2, matching choice C).

### answer #3 by Debate Agent AZYi:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 0d6U:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 7Qol:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent XVIh:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
