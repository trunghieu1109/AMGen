    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, choice1=&#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, choice3=&#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 5: Determine the uncertainty ΔP_z using the formula ΔP_z = √⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent UYxT:
We have ⟨P_z⟩ = ħ(|ψ₁|² − |ψ₃|²) = 0 and ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ²(|ψ₁|² + |ψ₃|²) = ħ²/2, so ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²) = √(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent bZ4c:
We have ⟨P_z⟩ = ħ(|ψ₁|² − |ψ₃|²) = ħ(1/4 − 1/4) = 0, and ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ²(|ψ₁|² + |ψ₃|²) = ħ²/2. Thus ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²) = √(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent CGyf:
We compute ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(|ψ₁|²−|ψ₃|²)=0 and ⟨P_z²⟩=ħ²(|ψ₁|²+|ψ₃|²)=ħ²/2, so ΔP_z=√(ħ²/2−0)=ħ/√2.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent OS6j:
We have ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(|ψ₁|²−|ψ₃|²)=0 and ⟨P_z²⟩=ħ²(|ψ₁|²+|ψ₃|²)=ħ²/2, hence ΔP_z=√(⟨P_z²⟩−⟨P_z⟩²)=√(ħ²/2)=ħ/√2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on ΔP_z.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
