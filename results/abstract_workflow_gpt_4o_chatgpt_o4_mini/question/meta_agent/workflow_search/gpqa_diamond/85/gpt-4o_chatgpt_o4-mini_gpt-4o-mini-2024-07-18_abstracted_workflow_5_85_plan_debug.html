Example(question=&#39;A chemist performed two reactions by taking two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. Select the proper starting material for both of the reactions.\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---&gt; (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nB + BH3 + H+ ---&gt; (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one&#39;, choice1=&#39;A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid&#39;, choice2=&#39;A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid&#39;, choice3=&#39;A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid&#39;, choice4=&#39;A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on impact of reduction. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 5JCt:
Based on the consensus, LiBH₄ gives anti hydride delivery to the carbonyl opposite the ether group, resulting in inversion. BH₃ chelates the carbonyl and ether oxygen to deliver hydride syn, resulting in retention.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 5JCt:
A + LiBH4 + H+: inversion of stereochemistry (anti addition); B + BH3 + H+: retention of stereochemistry (syn addition)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Select the correct starting materials for reactions A and B based on the stereochemical outcomes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
