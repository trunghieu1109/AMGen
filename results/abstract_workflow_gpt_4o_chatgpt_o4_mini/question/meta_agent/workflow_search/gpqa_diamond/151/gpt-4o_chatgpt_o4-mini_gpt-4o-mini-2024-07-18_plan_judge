Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_151
proposed answer: Active chromatin in the shmoo is transcriptionally active, recruiting the pre-initiation machinery and retaining histones; pre-replication complexes assemble only at origins for DNA synthesis and would be absent.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_151
proposed answer: Active chromatin in the shmoo will be enriched for transcription initiation machinery (pre-initiation complex), enhancer-associated factors, and nucleosome histones. Pre-replication complexes assemble at replication origins during G1 and are absent from actively transcribed regions, so they are least likely to be recovered by ChIPâ€“MS of active chromatin.
