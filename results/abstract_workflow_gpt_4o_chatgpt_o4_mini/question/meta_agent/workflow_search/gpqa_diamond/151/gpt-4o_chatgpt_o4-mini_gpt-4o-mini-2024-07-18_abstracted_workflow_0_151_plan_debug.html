    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?&#39;, choice1=&#39;pre-initiation complex&#39;, choice2=&#39;pre-replication complex&#39;, choice3=&#39;enhancer protein complex&#39;, choice4=&#39;nucleosome histone complex&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on protein complex evaluation. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 8Zc4:
Active chromatin in the mating-induced shmoo is transcriptionally active, recruiting the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation machinery and retaining modified histone-containing nucleosomes. Yeast lack defined mammalian-style enhancers and pre-replication complexes only assemble at origins for S phase, not at active transcription sites.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 8Zc4:
Pre-initiation complex: present; Pre-replication complex: absent; Enhancer protein complex: absent; Nucleosome histone complex: present

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry assay.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
