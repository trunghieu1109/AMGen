    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, choice2=&#39;A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, choice3=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm&#39;, choice4=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Select the correct pair of resonances connected by the cross-peak in the major products spectrum from the given choices, using the integrals from the corresponding 1H NMR. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 4vuT:
The NOESY cross‐peak arises from spatial proximity between the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride CH₂ protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), matching choice B.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent EWo3:
The NOESY cross-peak arises from spatial proximity between the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride CH₂ protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), matching the endo adduct.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Fkma:
The NOESY cross-peak arises from spatial proximity between the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridgehead proton) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride CH₂ protons), consistent with the endo adduct.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent PZd2:
The NOESY cross‐peak arises from spatial proximity between the bridgehead proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride CH₂ protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), matching choice B.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on resonances.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
