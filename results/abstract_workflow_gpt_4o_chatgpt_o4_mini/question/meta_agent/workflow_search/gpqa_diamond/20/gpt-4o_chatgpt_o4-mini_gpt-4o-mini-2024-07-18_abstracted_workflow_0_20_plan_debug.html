Example(question=&#39;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone &amp; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).&#39;, choice1=&#39;A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, choice2=&#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, choice3=&#39;A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, choice4=&#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Evaluate the structural characteristics of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate to determine which compound will show optical isomerism. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent zzTt:
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, allowing optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a trans alkene with no chiral centers and thus is not optically active.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent zzTt:
methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Select the compound from methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate that will show optical isomerism based on the evaluation from subtask_2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has a stereogenic carbon bearing four different substituents (–H, –OH, –COOCH₃, –CH₃), making it chiral and thus capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate lacks any stereogenic centers.
