Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and readily undergoes keto–enol tautomerism. p-Benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens in a context that would allow enolization without destroying aromaticity, so it does not show tautomerism.; answer: benzoquinone\nCoT agent 79Jc, evaluating stereochemical properties, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic center at the α-carbon, making it capable of optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate lacks a chiral center.; answer: B)\nCoT agent zVBA, analyzing benzoquinone, thinking: Benzoquinone has conjugated carbonyls within an aromatic ring but lacks α-hydrogens required for keto–enol tautomerism, and any enol form would disrupt aromatic stabilization.; answer: Benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\nCoT agent WX73, analyzing cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, thinking: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups and can form stable enol tautomers through keto–enol tautomerism. The presence of these α-hydrogens and the conjugation in the enol form drives the equilibrium toward tautomerization.; answer: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\nCoT agent 3Rbm, analyzing methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactic acid) has the substituents H, OH, CH3, and CO2Me on its α-carbon. These four different groups make that carbon stereogenic, so the molecule exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one chiral center at the α-carbon and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\nCoT agent xFvZ, analyzing dimethyl fumarate, thinking: Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans-alkene (E) configuration. Each carbon of the double bond is bonded to two different groups (–COOCH3 and –H), but the sp2 carbons are planar and cannot be stereogenic centers. There are no sp3 carbons bearing four different substituents, so no chiral centers exist in the molecule. Hence it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.; answer: Dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers and therefore does not exhibit optical isomerism.\nCoT agent q8v9, determining non-tautomeric compound, thinking: Based on the sub-task analyses, benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Thus the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.; answer: benzoquinone\nCoT agent ptYE, determining optically active compound, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one stereogenic α-carbon (four different substituents), while dimethyl fumarate has no sp³ chiral centers, so only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT agent BWVi, selecting correct choice, thinking: Based on sub-task 7, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
