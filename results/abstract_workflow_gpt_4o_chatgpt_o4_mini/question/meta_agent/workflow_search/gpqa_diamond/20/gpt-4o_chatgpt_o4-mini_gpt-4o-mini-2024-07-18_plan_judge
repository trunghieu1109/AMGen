Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_20
proposed answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has a stereogenic carbon bearing four different substituents (–H, –OH, –COOCH₃, –CH₃), making it chiral and thus capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate lacks any stereogenic centers.

Answer:methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
Extracted answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_20
proposed answer: Based on sub-task 7, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. Based on sub-task 8, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. This corresponds to choice 3, which is C).
