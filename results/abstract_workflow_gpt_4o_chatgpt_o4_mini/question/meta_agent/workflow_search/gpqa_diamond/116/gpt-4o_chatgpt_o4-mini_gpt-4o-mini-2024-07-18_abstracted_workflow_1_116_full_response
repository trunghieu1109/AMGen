This pattern of substitution creates severe steric hindrance to rotation about the central biaryl bond, locking the two rings into a nonplanar conformation. There are no sp3-hybridized stereocenters, but the restricted rotation furnishes a stereogenic axis (atropisomerism), resulting in enantiomeric conformers.; answer: It lacks tetrahedral chiral centers but is 2,6-disubstituted on each ring, causing hindered rotation about the biphenyl axis and thus axial chirality (atropisomerism).\nCoT agent zaP1, analyzing compound 2, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has the formula CH3–CH(OH)–CO2Me. The α-carbon (CH) is bonded to four different substituents (–H, –OH, –CH3, –CO2Me), making it a stereogenic center. Therefore the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains one chiral center at the α-carbon and is optically active.\nCoT agent 8jWd, analyzing compound 3, thinking: Benzophenone has a carbonyl carbon bonded to two identical phenyl rings, giving a trigonal planar center with no four different substituents. There are no stereocenters or elements of chirality.; answer: Benzophenone has no chiral centers or elements of chirality.\nCoT agent thWV, analyzing compound 4, thinking: Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH3O2C–CH=CH–CO2CH3. It has a planar C=C double bond and two equivalent ester groups. There are no sp3-hybridized carbons bearing four different substituents, nor any helical or axial chirality elements.; answer: Dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers or elements of chirality.\nDebate agent C0Oo, round 0, evaluating optical isomerism, thinking: Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism (1 has axial chirality, 2 has an sp3 stereocenter); 3 and 4 are achiral.; answer: B)\nDebate agent 8TVw, round 0, evaluating optical isomerism, thinking: Subtask 1: Compound 1 has no stereogenic centers but exhibits axial chirality (atropisomerism). Subtask 2: Compound 2 has one stereogenic sp3 center at the α-carbon. Subtasks 3 and 4: Compounds 3 and 4 lack stereogenic centers or chirality elements.
