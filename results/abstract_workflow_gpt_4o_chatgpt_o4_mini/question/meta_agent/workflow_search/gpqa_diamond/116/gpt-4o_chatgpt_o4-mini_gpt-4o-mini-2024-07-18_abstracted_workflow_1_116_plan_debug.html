    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, choice1=&#39;2 and 3&#39;, choice2=&#39;1 and 2&#39;, choice3=&#39;3 and 4&#39;, choice4=&#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent fKiF:
Compound 1 exhibits axial chirality (atropisomerism) and compound 2 has an sp3 stereocenter; compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. Thus only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

### answer by Final Decision Agent fKiF:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Match the compounds identified in subtask 5 with the given choices to determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
