This involves explaining the need for an asymmetric (sp3) carbon with four different substituents, lack of an internal plane of symmetry, and noting other sources of chirality (e.g., axial chirality).; answer: Optical isomerism requires a molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image, which most commonly arises from:\n1. A tetrahedral (sp3) carbon bearing four different substituents (a chiral center).\n2. Absence of any internal plane of symmetry (ensuring the two enantiomers are distinct).\n3. In less common cases, axial chirality (e.g., hindered rotation in substituted biphenyls) or planar chirality can also lead to optical activity.\nCoT agent LhqS, analyzing dimethyl 6,6-dinitro-[1,1-biphenyl]-2,2-dicarboxylate, thinking: The molecule is a 1,1'-biphenyl with nitro and ester groups at the 2,2' and 6,6' positions. All carbons in the rings are sp2-hybridized, and there are no tetrahedral carbons bearing four different substituents. Thus there are no conventional chiral centers (though the molecule could exhibit atropisomerism).; answer: No, it has no chiral centers.\nCoT agent Fybu, analyzing methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactic acid) has the structure CH3–CHOH–COOCH3. The central (2-) carbon is bonded to –OH, –H, –CH3, and –COOCH3, four different substituents, making it a chiral center.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one chiral center.\nCoT agent 3pk9, analyzing benzophenone, thinking: Benzophenone consists of an sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbon flanked by two phenyl rings and all other carbons are part of aromatic systems. There are no tetrahedral carbons bearing four different substituents.; answer: Benzophenone has no chiral centers.\nCoT agent DJpz, analyzing dimethyl fumarate, thinking: Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-but-2-enedioate). Its central carbons are sp2-hybridized in a C=C double bond and the remaining carbons do not bear four different substituents, so no tetrahedral stereocenter exists.; answer: Dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers.\nCoT-SC agent nUea, evaluating chiral centers, thinking: From subtasks: compound 1 can exhibit axial chirality (atropisomerism), compound 2 has a tetrahedral stereocenter, compounds 3 and 4 have none. Thus optical isomerism arises only in 1 and 2.; answer: B)\nCoT-SC agent BaNR, evaluating chiral centers, thinking: Sub-task analyses show only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (#2) has a chiral center. None of the given choices corresponds to only compound 2.; answer: [ERROR]\nCoT-SC agent d5q9, evaluating chiral centers, thinking: Based on the evaluations, compound 1 exhibits axial chirality (atropisomerism) and compound 2 has a stereogenic center; compounds 3 and 4 lack any form of chirality, so only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.; answer: B)\nCoT agent cCWz, comparing compounds with choices, thinking: Subtask 6 identified that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.
