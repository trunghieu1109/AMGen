Question: Example(question='"1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.\nFor the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?\n3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A\n3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B\n1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C', choice1='A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one', choice2='A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one', choice3='A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one', choice4='A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_33
proposed answer: The predicted products A (3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one), B (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one), and C (2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one) exactly match those listed in choice1.
