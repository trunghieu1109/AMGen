        "response": "The literature shows that under physiological conditions SARS-CoV-2\u2019s \u20131 frameshift pseudoknot predominantly folds into a single stable conformation, with only transient minor states under artificial tension. Moreover, experimental data indicate that frameshift efficiency correlates with the kinetics of pseudoknot unfolding, not the number of conformers. Thus the asserted linear relationship between conformational heterogeneity and frameshifting rate in statement D is contradicted by these studies.\n\nAnswer:Statement D is incorrect because multiple single-molecule and cryo-EM studies (e.g., Kelly et al., PNAS 2020; Zhang et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 2021) demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2\u2019s \u20131 frameshift pseudoknot adopts a single dominant fold under physiological conditions, and that frameshifting efficiency depends on unfolding kinetics rather than the number of pseudoknot conformations.",
