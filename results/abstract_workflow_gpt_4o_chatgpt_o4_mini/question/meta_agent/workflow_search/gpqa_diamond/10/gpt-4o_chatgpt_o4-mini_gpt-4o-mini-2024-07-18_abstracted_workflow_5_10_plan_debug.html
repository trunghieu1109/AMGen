    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.&#39;, choice2=&#39;SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. &#39;, choice3=&#39;SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. &#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Evaluate all statements and select the one that does not match the known scientific information about SARS-CoV-2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 5qSn:
Statement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp10–nsp14 ExoN complex’s function as preventing dsRNA breakdown rather than performing 3′→5′ exonucleolytic mismatch removal for proofreading, which is its established role. All other statements correctly reflect known molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KvSU:
Statement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp10–nsp14 ExoN complex’s function: it performs 3′→5′ exonucleolytic mismatch removal for proofreading, not prevention of dsRNA breakdown.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 3XBh:
Statement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp10–nsp14 ExoN complex’s function—it actually performs 3′→5′ exonucleolytic mismatch removal for proofreading, not prevention of dsRNA breakdown.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent PBR9:
Statement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp10–nsp14 ExoN complex as preventing dsRNA breakdown instead of performing 3′→5′ exonucleolytic proofreading, making it the incorrect statement.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 5qSn:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent KvSU:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 3XBh:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent PBR9:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on incorrect statement.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
