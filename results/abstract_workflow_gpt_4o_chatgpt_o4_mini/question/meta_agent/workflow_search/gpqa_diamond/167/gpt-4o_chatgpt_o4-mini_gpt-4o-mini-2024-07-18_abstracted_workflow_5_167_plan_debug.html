Example(question=&#39;Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The &#34;chr&#34; / &#34;no chr&#34; confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion&#39;, choice1=&#39;3 and 4&#39;, choice2=&#39;2 and 3&#39;, choice3=&#39;All of the above&#39;, choice4=&#39;2, 3 and 4&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Select qualifying elements by evaluating which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Wup8:
The most insidious sources of silent errors are chr/no chr confusion, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions; incompatible formats are caught early.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent IgPS:
While assembly mismatches and incorrect ID conversions are known to produce subtle, silent errors, the “chr”/“no chr” confusion also frequently slips through validation unnoticed. Mutually incompatible formats generally fail fast and are easier to detect. Thus the issues most commonly leading to difficult-to-spot errors are 2, 3 and 4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent FyEi:
Chr/no chr confusion, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions often pass validation silently and lead to the most difficult-to-spot erroneous results, whereas mutually incompatible formats are typically caught early.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent WYOc:
Silent, hard-to-spot errors typically arise when mismatches aren’t flagged immediately. “chr”/“no chr” confusion, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions often pass validation unnoticed, whereas incompatible formats usually trigger immediate errors.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Wup8:
D)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent IgPS:
D)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent FyEi:
D)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent WYOc:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on qualifying elements.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
