Substituting 20\u2009amu and 2\u2009amu gives μ = 40/22 ≈ 1.818\u2009amu. Converting to kg (1\u2009amu ≈ 1.6605×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg) yields ≈3.02×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg.; answer: μ = (20\u2009amu·2\u2009amu)/(20+2) ≈ 1.818\u2009amu ≈ 3.02×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg\nCoT agent hZFK, calculating moment of inertia, thinking: The moment of inertia I = μ·R².

We have I = 1.21×10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m². ħ = 1.054×10⁻³⁴ J·s. Compute B = ħ²/(2I) ≈ (1.054×10⁻³⁴)²/(2·1.21×10⁻⁴⁶) ≈ 4.6×10⁻²³ J. Thus E_J = 4.6×10⁻²³·J(J+1) J.; answer: Rotational energy levels: E_J = ħ²J(J+1)/(2I) ≃ 4.6×10⁻²³ J·J(J+1).
