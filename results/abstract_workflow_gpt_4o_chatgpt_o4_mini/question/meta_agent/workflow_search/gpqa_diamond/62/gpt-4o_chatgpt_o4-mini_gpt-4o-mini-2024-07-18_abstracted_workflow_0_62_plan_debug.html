Example(question=&#39;Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s&#39;, choice1=&#39;p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s&#39;, choice2=&#39;p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s&#39;, choice3=&#39;p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s&#39;, choice4=&#39;p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 4: Determine the momentum of the photon required to achieve this energy difference, using the relationship between energy and momentum for photons (E = pc, where E is energy, p is momentum, and c is the speed of light). 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent R6hT:
Using the photon relation E=pc with ΔE ≃ 9.2×10⁻²³ J and c ≃ 3.0×10⁸ m/s gives p = ΔE/c ≃ 9.2×10⁻²³ J / 3.0×10⁸ m/s ≃ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent XMTt:
Using the photon relation E = p·c with ΔE ≃ 9.2×10⁻²³ J and c ≃ 3.0×10⁸ m/s gives p = ΔE/c ≃ 9.2×10⁻²³ J / 3.0×10⁸ m/s ≃ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent gjZE:
Using the energy difference ΔE ≃ 9.2×10⁻²³ J and the photon relation E = p·c with c ≃ 3.0×10⁸ m/s, we get p = ΔE/c ≃ (9.2×10⁻²³ J)/(3.0×10⁸ m/s) ≃ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent lCGD:
Using E=pc with ΔE ≃9.2×10⁻²³ J and c≃3.0×10⁸ m/s gives p≈3.1×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s, which matches none of the provided choices.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent XMTt:
p ≃ 3.07×10⁻³¹ kg·m/s

### answer #3 by Debate Agent gjZE:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on photon momentum.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
