This is standard material that can be answered without further decomposition.; answer: In the SMEFT, Lorentz symmetry requires that every higher-dimensional operator be a scalar under Lorentz transformations. Fields are combined using contracted Lorentz indices (e.g. spinor indices with gamma matrices or vector indices with the metric tensor) so that the full operator remains invariant under boosts and rotations. This ensures the EFT respects the underlying spacetime symmetry of special relativity, constraining the allowed field combinations and derivative structures in the effective Lagrangian.\nCoT agent 5kK6, evaluating Poincare Symmetry, thinking: The user asks for an evaluation and characterization of Poincare symmetry within the context of the SMEFT. This is a conceptual question, not a multiple-choice one, so I provide a brief yet specific answer without the [TOO_HARD] marker.; answer: Poincare symmetry in SMEFT: \n\nPoincare symmetry combines spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations (rotations plus boosts) into a ten-generator group. In the SMEFT, all higher-dimensional operators added to the Standard Model Lagrangian must be constructed as scalars under this group. This enforces:\n1. Translation invariance → conservation of energy and momentum.\n2. Lorentz invariance → each operator must carry indices of fields and derivatives contracted to form overall Lorentz scalars. \n\nCharacterization:\n- Operators are classified by canonical dimension and Lorentz representation of the fields.\n- Derivatives acting on fields ensure correct transformation under boosts/rotations.\n- No explicit spacetime dependence appears in coefficients, preserving translational invariance.\n\nThus, Poincare invariance tightly constrains the form of allowed SMEFT operators, ensuring relativistic consistency and conservation laws.\nCoT agent GdD1, evaluating CP Symmetry, thinking: The user asks for an evaluation and characterization of CP symmetry in SMEFT. This is a conceptual question, not multiple choice. It can be answered directly without marked as too hard.; answer: In the Standard-Model Effective Field Theory, CP is treated as a discrete symmetry under which fields transform by charge conjugation (C) and spatial inversion (P). Operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian can be classified as CP-even or CP-odd. CP-even operators preserve the combined C and P transformation, while CP-odd operators flip sign under CP. Whether the full SMEFT Lagrangian respects CP depends on the Wilson coefficients: if all CP-odd operator coefficients vanish or are real in the appropriate basis, the theory is CP-symmetric; if any CP-odd coefficient has a nonzero imaginary part, CP is explicitly broken. Phenomenologically, CP-odd dimension-6 operators give rise to observables such as electric dipole moments, providing stringent experimental constraints on new sources of CP violation beyond the SM.\nCoT agent R8z1, evaluating CPT Symmetry, thinking: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property following from locality, Lorentz invariance, and unitarity of quantum field theory. In SMEFT, we assume the same basic field‐theoretic axioms as the SM, so all higher‐dimensional operators must respect CPT unless we introduce explicit CPT‐violating terms. Thus demonstrating CPT’s role in constraining operator forms and forbidding certain terms.; answer: In SMEFT, CPT symmetry holds exactly for all operators built from SM fields and respects locality, Lorentz invariance, and hermiticity. Any CPT violation would signal nonlocality or a breakdown of one of these foundational axioms, and so SMEFT operators are constructed to preserve CPT. \nReflexion CoT agent Qs2u, determining universally required symmetries, thinking: From sub-tasks: SMEFT operators must be Poincare invariant (includes Lorentz invariance) and preserve CPT by locality and hermiticity, but CP need not be respected universally. Thus the required symmetries are 1,2,4 corresponding to choice D).; answer: D)\nCritic agent 6Om1, providing feedback, thinking: The identification of Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) as the only universally required symmetries in SMEFT is sound because: SMEFT is built as a local, relativistic QFT, so Poincare invariance (which includes Lorentz) and CPT (from locality\u2009+\u2009hermiticity) must hold. Limitations include:\n1. The distinction between Lorentz and full Poincare invariance is often glossed over even though translations are equally fundamental.\n2. The argument presumes strict locality and absence of gravity-induced nonlocal effects, which may fail in a UV completion.\n3. Anomalies or spontaneous breaking can alter effective symmetry requirements at low energies.\n4. CP violation in the SM is allowed, so CP (3) is not generally imposed.\n\n; answer: 1,2,4\nReflexion CoT agent Qs2u, refining universally required symmetries, thinking: SMEFT operators must respect Poincare invariance (including Lorentz symmetry) and CPT symmetry due to locality and hermiticity; CP symmetry is not universally required.; answer: D)\nCritic agent 6Om1, providing feedback, thinking: The identification of Poincaré invariance (which includes Lorentz symmetry) and CPT symmetry as universal requirements for SMEFT operators is sound for any local, unitary, and hermitian effective field theory. However, this determination omits several important points: it doesn’t mention gauge invariance under the SM gauge group (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)), neglects potential anomalies or higher-order effects that could violate discrete symmetries, and redundantly lists Lorentz symmetry separately from Poincaré. Moreover, it doesn’t address how CP violation beyond the SM may enter at higher dimensions.; answer: 1,2,4\nReflexion CoT agent Qs2u, refining universally required symmetries, thinking: SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré invariance (which includes Lorentz symmetry) and CPT symmetry by construction as a local, unitary, hermitian QFT. CP symmetry is not universally enforced. Thus the required symmetries are 1,2,4.; answer: D)\nCritic agent 6Om1, providing feedback, thinking: The determination correctly notes that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (and thus Poincaré) invariance and CPT symmetry. However, it omits that all operators must also obey the underlying gauge symmetries (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)) and the constraints from the specific field content of the theory. It also doesn’t address how spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking or accidental global symmetries (like baryon and lepton number) further restrict operator forms, so the statement is incomplete.; answer: 1,2,4\nReflexion CoT agent Qs2u, refining universally required symmetries, thinking: SMEFT operators are built as local, unitary, hermitian QFT terms, so they must respect Lorentz invariance and translations (Poincaré symmetry) as well as CPT; CP need not be universally enforced.; answer: D)\nCoT agent AscY, comparing symmetries with choices, thinking: All SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz invariance (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT (4).
