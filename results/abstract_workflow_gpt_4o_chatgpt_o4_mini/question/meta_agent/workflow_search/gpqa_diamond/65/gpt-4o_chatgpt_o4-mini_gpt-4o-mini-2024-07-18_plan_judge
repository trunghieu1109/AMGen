Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_65
proposed answer: All SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz invariance (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT (4). Comparing to the provided choices, only choice 4 (“1,2,4”) includes exactly these symmetries.

Answer:D)
