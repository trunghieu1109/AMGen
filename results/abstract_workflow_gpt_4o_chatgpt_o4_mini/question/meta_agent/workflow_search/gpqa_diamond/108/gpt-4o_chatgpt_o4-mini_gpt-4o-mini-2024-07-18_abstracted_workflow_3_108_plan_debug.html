    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.&#39;, choice1=&#39;1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s&#39;, choice2=&#39;1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p&#39;, choice3=&#39;1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f&#39;, choice4=&#39;1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 5: Identify which partial wave transition does not satisfy the conditions and is therefore not permitted. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 1f1f:
For T(NN)=0, Pauli statistics require S+L≡1 (mod 2). In the 3P0 state, S=1 and L=1 give S+L=2 (even), violating the constraint, so 1S0 → 3P0 + s is forbidden.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 8Hae:
For T(NN)=0, Pauli statistics require S(NN)+L(NN)≡1 (mod2). The 3P0 state has S=1 and L=1, so S+L=2 (even), violating this constraint. Thus the 1S0→3P0+s transition is forbidden.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 9dNc:
For T(NN)=0 Pauli statistics require S+L≡1 mod2. In 3P0, S=1 and L=1 give S+L=2 (even), violating the constraint.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 9YzH:
For T(NN)=0, Pauli statistics require S+L ≡ 1 (mod 2). In the 3P0 final state, S=1 and L=1 gives S+L=2 (even), violating the constraint, so 1S0 → 3P0 + s is forbidden.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on which partial wave transition is not permitted.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
