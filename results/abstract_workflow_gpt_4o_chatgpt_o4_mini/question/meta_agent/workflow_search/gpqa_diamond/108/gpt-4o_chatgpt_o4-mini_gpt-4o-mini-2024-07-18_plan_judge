Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_108
proposed answer: For the 1S0 -> 3P0 + s transition, the final NN has S=1, L=1, so S+L+1 = 3 ≡1 mod2, but T=0, violating the Pauli requirement. The other transitions satisfy both angular momentum, parity, and the T = S+L+1 mod2 condition.

proposed answer: Pauli statistics for T(NN)=0 require S+L≡1 mod2. In the 3P0 state, S=1 and L=1 giving S+L=2 (even), so the 1S0→3P0+s transition is forbidden.
