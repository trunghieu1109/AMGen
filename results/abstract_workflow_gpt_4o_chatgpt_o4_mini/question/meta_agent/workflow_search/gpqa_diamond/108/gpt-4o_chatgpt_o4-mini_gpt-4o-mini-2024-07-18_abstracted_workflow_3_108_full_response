Pauli requires T_i = S+L+1 mod2 =1, so isospin T_i=1. The final NN states are the various term symbols with T_f=0: e.g. 3P0 has S=1,L=1,J=0; 3S1 has S=1,L=0,J=1; 3D3 has S=1,L=2,J=3; the exotic “7D1” would imply 2S+1=7⇒S=3,L=2,J=1 (though S=3 is unphysical for two nucleons). The emitted X has intrinsic parity -1, assumed spin‐0, and carries orbital angular momentum ℓ corresponding to the lowercase label: s→ℓ=0, p→ℓ=1, f→ℓ=3.; answer: Initial NN: 1S0 ⇒ S=0, L=0, J=0, T=1. Final NN (T=0):\n• 3P0 ⇒ S=1, L=1, J=0\n• 3S1 ⇒ S=1, L=0, J=1\n• 3D3 ⇒ S=1, L=2, J=3\n• 7D1 ⇒ 2S+1=7⇒S=3, L=2, J=1 (formally listed)\nEmitted X: spin=0, parity=-1, orbital ℓ = 0(s),1(p),3(f) depending on the partial wave.\nCoT agent MKjo, thinking: We need to enforce conservation of total angular momentum and parity in the transition from the initial NN state (J_i=0, π_i=+1) plus emitted particle X (intrinsic parity -1). Total final angular momentum is J_f = J_NN + ℓ, so 0 = J_NN + ℓ ⇒ ℓ = J_NN. Parity: π_i = π_NN * π_X * (-1)^ℓ ⇒ +1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^ℓ ⇒ (-1)^{L_f+1+ℓ} = +1 ⇒ L_f + ℓ is odd.; answer: Angular momentum: J_i=0 ⇒ ℓ = J_NN(final). Parity: require (–1)^{L_f+1+ℓ}=+1 ⇒ L_f+ℓ odd.\nCoT agent nSXQ, thinking: We impose T(NN)=0 and the Pauli requirement T= S+L+1 (mod2). Setting T=0 gives S+L+1≡0 ⇒ S+L≡1 (mod2). Thus the NN final state must have S+L odd.; answer: The Pauli constraint yields S(NN)+L(NN)=1 (mod 2).\nCoT agent 8u9b, thinking: T(NN)=0 requires S(NN)+L(NN)≡1 (mod2). For 3P0 (S=1, L=1), S+L=2 (even), violating the Pauli constraint.
