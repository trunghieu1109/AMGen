Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_171
proposed answer: Based on the Boltzmann relation ln(n1/n2)=ΔE/k_B(1/T2−1/T1), rearranged gives ln(2)=(T1−T2)/(T1·T2), which matches choice D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_171
proposed answer: The Boltzmann relation under LTE gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁). Rearranging yields ln(2) ∝ (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂), which matches choice D.
