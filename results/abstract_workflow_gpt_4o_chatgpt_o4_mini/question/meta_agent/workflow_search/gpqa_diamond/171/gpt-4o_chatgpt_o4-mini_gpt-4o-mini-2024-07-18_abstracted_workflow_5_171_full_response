This is an open explanatory question, not multiple-choice, so I will provide a concise explanation without selecting an alphabet choice.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent MtpA:\nBy using ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1), we see that the factor of two difference in population directly constrains the temperature difference between the two stellar photospheres. A small Δ(1/T)=1/T2−1/T1 corresponding to ln(2) implies that even modest changes in T produce measurable shifts in excitation. Thus, if star_1 has twice the excited‐level iron fraction of star_2, T1 must exceed T2 by an amount set by ΔE/(k\u2009ln2). This relation allows astronomers to quantify relative effective temperatures purely from relative line strengths under LTE, linking microscopic atomic populations to macroscopic stellar parameters.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Select the correct equation that satisfies the derived relationship and matches the conditions of the problem.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent 3zUo, identifying parameters, thinking: We are asked to identify and understand the parameters provided: the relative excitation levels of iron atoms in two stellar photospheres, the energy separation of the levels, and the LTE assumption. These are sufficient for writing the Boltzmann relation between T1 and T2.; answer: Given parameters:\n1) Ratio of excited iron atoms in star_1 to star_2: 2:1.\n2) Energy difference between levels, ΔE = 1.38 × 10^(-23) J.\n3) Assumption: photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), allowing use of the Boltzmann distribution.\n4) Unknowns to solve for: effective temperatures T_1 and T_2.\nCoT agent zjQN, interpreting energy difference, thinking: We must explain how ΔE enters the Boltzmann distribution for level populations under LTE. The relative number of atoms in an excited state compared to the ground state is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), so ΔE determines how sensitive the population ratio is to temperature.; answer: In the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is n_j/n_i=(g_j/g_i)·exp(−ΔE/(kT)). Thus the given ΔE=1.38×10^−23\u2009J appears in the exponential factor that sets the fraction of excited iron atoms. A larger ΔE makes excitation much less likely at a given T, while for fixed ΔE the ratio of excited atoms directly constrains T via exp(−ΔE/(kT)).\nCoT agent PeoS, applying Boltzmann distribution, thinking: Under LTE the level populations follow n_j/n_i ∝ exp(–ΔE/(kT)). Denote R1= (n_j/n_i)_1, R2= (n_j/n_i)_2. Given R1/R2=2, we have exp(–ΔE/(kT1)) / exp(–ΔE/(kT2)) = 2 ⇒ exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 – 1/T1)] = 2 ⇒ ln2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 – 1/T1).
