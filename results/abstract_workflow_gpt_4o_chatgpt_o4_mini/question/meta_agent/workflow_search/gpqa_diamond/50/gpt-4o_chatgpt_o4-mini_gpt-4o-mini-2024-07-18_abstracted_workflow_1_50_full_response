The image charge magnitude is q' = -q·R/d, and it is located on the line joining the real charge and the sphere center, at a distance R^2/d from the center.; answer: The image charge is q' = -q·R/d, located a distance R^2/d from the sphere’s center along the radial line toward the real charge.\nCoT-SC agent ssRv, calculating potential, thinking: The image charge has magnitude q' = -qR/d at distance R^2/d from center. The separation from the real charge at distance d is d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d. Thus the potential at the real charge due to the image is k q'/(separation) = k(-qR/d)/((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k qR/(d^2 - R^2).; answer: -k qR/(d^2 - R^2)\nCoT-SC agent PabD, calculating potential, thinking: The image charge q' = -qR/d is located a distance R^2/d from the center. The separation between the image and real charge is d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d. Thus V at the real charge due to the image is kq' divided by that separation: V = k(-qR/d)/[(d^2 - R^2)/d] = -kqR/(d^2 - R^2).; answer: V = -k q R/(d^2 - R^2)\nCoT-SC agent 4cf9, calculating potential, thinking: The image charge q' = -qR/d is located at R^2/d from the center. The potential at the real charge’s position (distance d from center) due to q' is V = (1/4πε₀)·q'/|d - R^2/d| = -(1/4πε₀)·qR/d divided by (d^2 - R^2)/d = -(1/4πε₀)·qR/(d^2 - R^2).; answer: V = -(1/(4πε₀))·qR/(d^2 - R^2)\nReflexion CoT agent dHI1, calculating potential energy, thinking: The interaction energy between the real charge q and the image charge q' at separation s is U_int = k\u2009q\u2009q'/s. Here q' = –q\u2009R/d and s = d – R^2/d = (d^2 – R^2)/d. Substituting gives U_int = –k\u2009q^2\u2009R/(d^2 – R^2). Because the image method requires a ½ factor when computing the energy of assembling the induced charges, the net potential energy is U = ½\u2009U_int = –(1/2)\u2009k\u2009q^2\u2009R/(d^2 – R^2).; answer: U = –(1/2)\u2009k\u2009q^2\u2009R/(d^2 – R^2)\nCritic agent xDPo, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation of U=−½\u2009k\u2009q²\u2009R/(d²−R²) using the image‐charge method is mathematically correct under its idealized assumptions. In particular, it assumes a point charge q located outside a grounded, perfectly conducting sphere (d>R) in vacuum, and it uses the ½ factor to account for the work of assembling the induced surface charge. However, this result is limited by several idealizations: it fails if the charge approaches or crosses the surface (d≤R), if the sphere is not perfectly conducting or not grounded, if there are other nearby bodies or dielectric media, and it neglects self‐energy of the induced charge distribution, finite‐size or quantum effects, and any dynamic or non‐electrostatic phenomena.; answer: Valid only for a point charge outside (d>R) a grounded, perfect conductor in vacuum; ignores self‐energy of induced charges and non‐ideal, nonstatic effects.\nReflexion CoT agent dHI1, refining potential energy calculation, thinking: For sub-task 3, we use the interaction energy between the real charge q and its image charge q′=−qR/d separated by s=(d^2−R^2)/d: U_int=kqq′/s=−kq^2R/(d^2−R^2). The image‐method energy includes a ½ factor: U=½U_int.; answer: U = −(1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 − R^2)\nCritic agent xDPo, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation using the image‐charge method is sound and yields U=½·(kq·q′)/s with q′=−qR/d and s=(d²−R²)/d, giving U=−(1/2)·kq²R/(d²−R²).  Limitations: 1) valid only for a single, perfectly conducting, grounded sphere and a point charge outside it (d>R); 2) assumes quasi‐static (no radiation) and neglects any self‐energy divergences as the charge approaches the surface; 3) ignores any other nearby conductors or dielectric media; 4) requires linear, electrostatic behaviour (no nonlinearity or time dependence).; answer: U = - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)\nReflexion CoT agent dHI1, refining potential energy calculation, thinking: The interaction energy between the real charge q and its image q' = -qR/d at separation s = (d^2 - R^2)/d is U_int = k q q' / s = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). Including the ½ factor for assembling the induced charge yields U = -½ k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).; answer: U = -½ k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)\nCritic agent xDPo, providing feedback, thinking: The image‐charge derivation U=−½\u2009k\u2009q²R/(d²−R²) is algebraically consistent and correctly includes the ½ assembly factor for the induced charge. However its validity is limited by several assumptions: (1) the real charge must remain outside the sphere (d>R); (2) the sphere is treated as an ideal, infinitely conductive, grounded shell of negligible thickness; (3) mutual interactions between induced surface elements (self‐energy) are not explicitly computed but absorbed into the ½ factor; (4) no other charges or external fields are present. If any of these conditions fail (charge inside, finite conductivity, non‐grounded sphere, dynamic assembly, additional fields), the result no longer strictly applies.; answer: U = -½ k q² R/(d² - R²)\nReflexion CoT agent dHI1, refining potential energy calculation, thinking: The image charge method gives q' = -qR/d located inside the sphere. The separation between q and q' is s = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d. The interaction energy is U_int = k q q'/s = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).
