Example(question=&#39;What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?&#39;, choice1=&#39;2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone&#39;, choice2=&#39;(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol&#39;, choice3=&#39;(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol&#39;, choice4=&#39;4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Select the most likely major product of the reaction by comparing the potential products with the given choices and considering the stability and likelihood of formation. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent wYwh:
The reaction undergoes keto–enol tautomerization of the starting enol to its keto form, which then undergoes electrophilic α-bromination preferentially at the 2-position. This yields 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone as the major product.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent em9A:
The substrate exists primarily in the keto form under reaction conditions and undergoes electrophilic α-bromination at the 2-position, yielding 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone as the major product.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 91Lk:
The enol tautomerizes to its keto form, which then undergoes electrophilic α-bromination preferentially at C-2. This yields 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone as the major product.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent kWpD:
The enol tautomerizes to the keto form which then undergoes electrophilic α-bromination at C-2, giving 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone as the major product.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent wYwh:
A)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent em9A:
A)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 91Lk:
A)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent kWpD:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the major product.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
