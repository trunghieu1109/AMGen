Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_117
proposed answer: The enol tautomerizes to the more stable keto form, which then undergoes electrophilic α-bromination preferentially at the C-2 position, yielding 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone as the major product.
