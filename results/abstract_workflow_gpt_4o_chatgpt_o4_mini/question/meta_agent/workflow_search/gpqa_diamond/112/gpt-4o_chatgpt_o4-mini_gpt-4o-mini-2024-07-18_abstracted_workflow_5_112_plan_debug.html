    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.&#39;, choice1=&#39;C6H10O2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C6H12O&#39;, choice3=&#39;C6H10O&#39;, choice4=&#39;C6H12O2&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 8: Assess the proposed structural model against the given chemical formula options (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2) to determine which formula best fits the data. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent to60:
The structural model corresponds to ethyl crotonate, which has formula C6H10O2. Among the options, C6H10O2 is choice A).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent to60:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Select the chemical formula that matches the proposed structural model and the data from all characterization techniques.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
