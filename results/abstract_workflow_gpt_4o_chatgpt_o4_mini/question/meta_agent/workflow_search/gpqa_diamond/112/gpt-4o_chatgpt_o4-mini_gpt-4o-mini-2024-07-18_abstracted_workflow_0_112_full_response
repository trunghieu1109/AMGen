The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group. The absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is typical of a C=C double bond stretch.; answer: Broad O–H stretch, strong C=O stretch, C=C stretch\nCoT agent VbgC, analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The sub-task asks to analyze the given 1H NMR data for vinyl hydrogens and other environments. Vinyl protons typically appear around 5–7 ppm, while aliphatic CH2 and CH3 groups show up at lower fields. The presence of a broad OH proton for a carboxylic acid may also be observed downfield.; answer: Vinyl H: two signals at δ5.8–6.3 ppm (doublets, J≈10 Hz) indicating CH=CH; α‐CH2 to C=O at δ2.3 ppm (triplet); β‐CH2 at δ1.6 ppm (multiplet); γ‐CH2 at δ1.3 ppm (multiplet); terminal CH3 at δ0.9 ppm (triplet); broad singlet ~11 ppm for COOH–OH\nCoT agent WsnC, analyzing mass spectrum, thinking: The m/z 45 peak does not correspond to simple alkyl fragments (which give even masses) but matches the ethoxy cation C2H5O+ (molecular weight 45). This arises from α‐cleavage next to an oxygen, yielding CH3CH2O+ (or its protonated form CH3CH2OH+•). Alternative is the protonated acetaldehyde fragment, but that is also C2H5O+.; answer: Possible fragment at m/z 45 is the ethoxy cation C2H5O+ (CH3CH2O+), formed by α‐cleavage of an ether or ester C–O bond.\nCoT-SC agent 1Pfz, proposing structural features, thinking: FTIR shows a broad O–H stretch at ~3000 cm⁻¹ (carboxylic acid), a strong C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a C=C stretch at 1650 cm⁻¹. ¹H NMR shows vinyl protons (δ 5.8–6.3), multiple CH₂ signals (δ 2.3, 1.6, 1.3), a terminal CH₃ (δ 0.9), and a broad COOH proton (~11 ppm). MS m/z 45 matches the COOH⁺ fragment. These data point to an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons.; answer: An α,β-unsaturated C₆ carboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂) featuring one C=C (vinyl) and one COOH group, e.g. 2-hexenoic acid.\nCoT-SC agent PYNW, proposing structural features, thinking: The FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid (broad O–H, C=O at 1700\u2009cm⁻¹) plus a C=C (1650\u2009cm⁻¹). 1H NMR shows vinyl protons and a broad COOH signal around 11\u2009ppm. MS m/z 45 arises from a McLafferty rearrangement giving C2H5O+. Together these point to a six‐carbon unsaturated carboxylic acid (C6H10O2) with a terminal or internal double bond.; answer: Contains a –COOH group, a C=C (vinyl) unit, linear six‐carbon backbone; undergoes McLafferty rearrangement (C2H5O+ at m/z 45), consistent with an unsaturated hexenoic acid (C6H10O2).\nCoT-SC agent boYf, proposing structural features, thinking: The FTIR shows O–H, C=O and C=C stretches; 1H NMR confirms vinyl protons, methylene and methyl groups plus COOH–OH; the m/z 45 fragment arises via McLafferty rearrangement from a carboxylic acid.
