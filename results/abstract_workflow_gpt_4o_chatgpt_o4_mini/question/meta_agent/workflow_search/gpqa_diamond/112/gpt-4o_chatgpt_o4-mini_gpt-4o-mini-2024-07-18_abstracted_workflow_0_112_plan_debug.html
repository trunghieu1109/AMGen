    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.&#39;, choice1=&#39;C6H10O2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C6H12O&#39;, choice3=&#39;C6H10O&#39;, choice4=&#39;C6H12O2&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on chemical formula. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 1RzS:
The FTIR shows a broad O–H stretch (~3000 cm⁻¹) and a strong C=O stretch (1700 cm⁻¹) plus C=C stretch (1650 cm⁻¹). ¹H NMR indicates vinyl hydrogens and a COOH proton, and the MS fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to the carboxyl group. These observations best fit an α,β-unsaturated C6 carboxylic acid, C6H10O2.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 1RzS:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Apply logical reasoning to confirm the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the best match from the previous evaluation.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
