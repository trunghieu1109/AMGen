Typical vinyl protons resonate around 5–6 ppm with characteristic splitting; allylic or carbonyl-adjacent CH2 appear around 2–3 ppm; methyl groups near 0.9–1.3 ppm; OH broad around 2–5 ppm. Using these guidelines we can assign each environment.; answer: In the 1H NMR spectrum we see:\n• Multiplets at δ 5.2–6.3 ppm (total ~2H) – vinyl protons on C=C\n• Triplet at δ ~2.3 ppm (2H) – CH2 adjacent to C=O\n• Multiplet at δ ~1.8 ppm (2H) – allylic CH2 further from the C=O\n• Triplet at δ ~1.2 ppm (3H) – terminal CH3\n• Broad signal at δ ~2.8 ppm (1H) – OH proton\nThese assignments confirm the presence of vinyl hydrogens plus distinct aliphatic and hydroxyl environments.\nCoT agent Zg4I, analyzing mass spectrum, thinking: The m/z 45 peak most commonly corresponds to the C2H5O+ ion (mass 45), which can arise from cleavage at the C–O bond giving either the ethoxy radical cation CH3CH2O•+ or the protonated ethanol fragment CH3CH2OH+. A smaller possibility is CH2OH+ (mass 31) plus a methyl shift, but C2H5O+ is the predominant assignment. This supports presence of an oxygen-containing moiety adjacent to a C–C bond.; answer: The m/z 45 fragment is best assigned as the C2H5O+ ion (e.g., CH3CH2O•+ or CH3CH2OH+).\nCoT agent UxA5, hypothesizing functional groups, thinking: Based on broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ for O–H stretch, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ for carbonyl C=O, and absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C alkene, the compound likely contains hydroxyl, carbonyl, and alkene functional groups.; answer: Hydroxyl (O–H), carbonyl (C=O), and alkene (C=C) functional groups\nCoT agent QzqL, hypothesizing structural features, thinking: We have vinyl protons at 5.2–6.3 ppm indicating a C=C double bond, CH2 groups adjacent to a carbonyl at 2.3 ppm, allylic CH2 at 1.8 ppm, a terminal methyl at 1.2 ppm, and a broad OH at 2.8 ppm. Combined with FTIR showing a broad O–H and C=O stretch and MS fragment at m/z 45 (likely CH3CHO+), these data point to a six-carbon backbone featuring an alkene, a ketone or aldehyde, and an alcohol functionality.; answer: The molecule likely contains a C=C double bond (vinyl group), a carbonyl (C=O) group, a hydroxyl (–OH), two CH2 units between these functionalities, and a terminal CH3 group.\nCoT agent mZJ4, hypothesizing molecular fragments, thinking: The m/z 45 signal is confidently assigned to C2H5O+ from cleavage at an oxygen–carbon bond. This fragment implies an ethoxy unit (–O–CH2CH3) in the parent. Such a cleavage is characteristic of esters or ethers, especially alpha‐cleavage next to a carbonyl. No additional ambiguous fragments are given, so we focus on the ethoxy evidence to infer an ester linkage.; answer: Possible fragments include the C2H5O+ ion at m/z 45 arising from α‐cleavage of an ethyl ester or ether. This implies the molecule contains an ethoxy (–O–CH2CH3) moiety adjacent to a carbonyl or similar electronegative center, consistent with an unsaturated ester structure.\nCoT agent igbd, proposing structural model, thinking: Combining a broad 3000 cm⁻¹ band (initially O–H but more consistent with hydrogen-bonded C–H in an acid was discarded), strong C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹ and C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹, vinyl protons at 5.2–6.3 ppm, CH2 signals consistent with ethyl and allylic fragments, and an m/z 45 C2H5O+ fragment indicative of an ethoxy–carbonyl linkage, points to an unsaturated ester. The only formula matching C6H10O2 with these features is ethyl crotonate (trans-2-butenoate).; answer: Ethyl crotonate (CH3–CH=CH–COO–CH2–CH3)\nCoT agent to60, assessing structural model, thinking: The structural model corresponds to ethyl crotonate, which has formula C6H10O2.
