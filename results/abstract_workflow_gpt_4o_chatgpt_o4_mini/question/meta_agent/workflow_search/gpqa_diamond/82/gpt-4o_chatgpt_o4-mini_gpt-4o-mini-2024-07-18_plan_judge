Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_82
proposed answer: At equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate: [A−]=1.00 mmol/0.050 L=0.0200 M, Kb=Kw/Ka≈5.405×10−10, [OH−]=√(Kb·C)=3.29×10−6 M → pOH≈5.48 → pH≈8.52, matching choice 2.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_17_82
proposed answer: At equivalence all 0.00100 mol CH₃COOH is converted to CH₃COO⁻ in 50.00 mL, so [CH₃COO⁻]=0.0200 M. Kb=Kw/Ka=1×10⁻¹⁴/1.85×10⁻⁵=5.41×10⁻¹⁰. [OH⁻]=√(Kb·C)=√(5.41×10⁻¹⁰×0.0200)=3.29×10⁻⁶ M, pOH=5.48, hence pH=14−5.48=8.52.
