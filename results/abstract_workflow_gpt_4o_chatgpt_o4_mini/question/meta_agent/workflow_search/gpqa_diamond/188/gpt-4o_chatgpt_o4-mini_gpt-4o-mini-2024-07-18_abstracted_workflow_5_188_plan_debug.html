    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?&#39;, choice1=&#39;Magnon&#39;, choice2=&#39;Skyrmion&#39;, choice3=&#39;Pion&#39;, choice4=&#39;Phonon&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Analyze the relationship between each particle and spontaneously-broken symmetry based on their characteristics. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9V8U:
We have identified from prior analyses that magnons and phonons arise as Goldstone bosons of broken continuous symmetries in solids, pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and skyrmions are topological solitons in fields with broken symmetry rather than gapless modes.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9V8U:
Magnon: Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous spin-rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered solid.
Skyrmion: Topological soliton in a field with underlying broken continuous symmetry, stabilized by topology rather than as a Goldstone mode.
Pion: Pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(2)Ã—SU(2) symmetry in QCD, acquiring mass from explicit quark-mass terms.
Phonon: Goldstone boson emerging from spontaneous breaking of continuous translational (and sometimes rotational) symmetry in a crystal lattice.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry by comparing the analysis results.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
