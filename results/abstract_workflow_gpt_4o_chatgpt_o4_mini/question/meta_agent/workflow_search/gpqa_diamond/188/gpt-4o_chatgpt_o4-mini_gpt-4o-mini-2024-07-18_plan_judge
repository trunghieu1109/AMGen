Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_188
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons arise as Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotation, chiral, and translational respectively), whereas skyrmions are topological solitons not tied to any spontaneously broken symmetry.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_188
proposed answer: Magnons, phonons, and pions are all Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken symmetries. Skyrmions are topological solitons stabilized by topology rather than as gapless modes of broken symmetry.
