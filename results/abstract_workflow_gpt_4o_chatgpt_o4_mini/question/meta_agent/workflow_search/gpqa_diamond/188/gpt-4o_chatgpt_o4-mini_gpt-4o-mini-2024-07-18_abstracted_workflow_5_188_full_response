As a result, although the laws remain invariant, the chosen vacuum state breaks the symmetry, leading to phenomena such as the emergence of massless Nambu–Goldstone bosons if the symmetry is continuous.\nCoT agent 2en9, identifying particle characteristics, thinking: To address the sub-task, I list each quasiparticle or particle with its defining features and the symmetry or context in which it arises.; answer: Magnon: A collective spin-wave excitation in a magnetically ordered solid; Goldstone mode of spontaneously broken continuous spin-rotation symmetry in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets.\n\nSkyrmion: A topological soliton configuration in a continuous field (e.g., magnetization texture); characterized by a nontrivial topological charge; not itself a Goldstone boson but stabilized by topology in systems with broken symmetries.\n\nPion: Light meson composed of up and down quarks; pseudo–Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics; its small mass arises from explicit chiral symmetry breaking by quark masses.\n\nPhonon: Quantum of lattice vibrational modes in a crystal; Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken continuous translational (and sometimes rotational) symmetry in the solid state.\nReflexion CoT agent 9V8U, analyzing particle relationships, thinking: The user asks for an analysis of how each of the four excitations relates to spontaneously-broken symmetry. This is not a multiple-choice question, so I will provide a descriptive answer mapping each particle to its broken symmetry.; answer: Magnon: Arises as the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken continuous spin-rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered solid.\nSkyrmion: A topological soliton in a field with underlying broken symmetry, but not a Goldstone mode; its stability is topological rather than due to a continuous symmetry breaking.\nPion: Acts as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD, acquiring a small mass from explicit symmetry breaking by quark masses.\nPhonon: Functions as the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken continuous translational (and sometimes rotational) symmetry in a crystal lattice.\nCritic agent Mmv1, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly links magnons and phonons to Goldstone modes and pions to pseudo-Goldstone bosons, but it oversimplifies skyrmions’ topological origin and omits details on explicit symmetry breaking and specific symmetry groups.; answer: Magnon: Goldstone boson arising from spontaneously broken SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered solid.\nSkyrmion: Topological soliton originating from nontrivial π2 homotopy of the order parameter manifold in a broken-symmetry phase; not a Goldstone fluctuation mode.\nPion: Pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry in QCD; acquires a small mass from explicit quark-mass terms.\nPhonon: Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice (and often broken rotational symmetry).\n[TOO_HARD]\nTo refine this analysis, one should specify the exact symmetry groups, detail the explicit symmetry-breaking terms, and present the underlying field-theoretic Lagrangians.\nReflexion CoT agent 9V8U, refining particle relationships, thinking: We have enough information from prior sub-tasks to map each particle to its spontaneously-broken symmetry role: magnons and phonons are true Goldstone modes of broken continuous symmetries in solids; pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry in QCD; skyrmions are topological solitons in broken-symmetry fields rather than Goldstone excitations.; answer: Magnon: Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous spin-rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered solid.\nSkyrmion: Topological soliton in a field whose underlying continuous symmetry is broken, stabilized by topology rather than as a Goldstone mode.\nPion: Pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry in QCD, acquiring mass via explicit symmetry breaking by quark masses.\nPhonon: Goldstone boson emerging from spontaneous breaking of continuous translational (and sometimes rotational) symmetry in a crystalline lattice.\nCritic agent Mmv1, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies magnons and phonons as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes arising from broken continuous symmetries, and pions as pseudo-Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry. It also recognizes skyrmions as topological solitons rather than gapless modes. Limitations include: (1) real crystals only break translations discretely, so phonons are technically pseudo-Goldstone modes; (2) magnetic anisotropy explicitly breaks spin-rotation symmetry, giving magnons a gap; (3) pions acquire mass from explicit symmetry breaking by quark masses; (4) skyrmions depend on continuum field theories and neglect lattice/discretization effects and interactions with other excitations.; answer: Skyrmion\nReflexion CoT agent 9V8U, refining particle relationships, thinking: We have identified that magnons and phonons are true Goldstone modes from broken continuous symmetries in solids; pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD; skyrmions are topological solitons in broken-symmetry fields rather than gapless Goldstone excitations. This directly answers the sub-task.; answer: Magnon: Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous spin-rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered solid.\nSkyrmion: Topological soliton in a field with underlying broken continuous symmetry, stabilized by topology rather than as a Goldstone mode.\nPion: Pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry in QCD, acquiring mass via explicit symmetry breaking by quark masses.\nPhonon: Goldstone boson emerging from spontaneous breaking of continuous translational (and sometimes rotational) symmetry in a crystalline lattice.\nCritic agent Mmv1, providing feedback, thinking: The original analysis correctly classifies magnons, phonons, and pions as (pseudo)-Goldstone modes arising from broken continuous symmetries and identifies skyrmions as topological solitons. However, it overlooks several subtleties:\n1. Phonons in a crystal emerge from a discrete lattice and are only approximate Goldstone modes of translation symmetry.  \n2. Magnons rely on an approximate SU(2) spin‐rotation symmetry; anisotropies or spin–orbit coupling explicitly break it.  \n3. Pions are strictly massless only in the chiral limit; the analysis should emphasize explicit symmetry breaking by quark masses.  \n4. Skyrmions are solitonic configurations in the nonlinear sigma model describing pions, not elementary excitations of the vacuum.\n; answer: Magnon: An approximate Goldstone excitation from spontaneous breaking of (nearly) continuous spin‐rotation symmetry in a magnet (explicitly lifted by anisotropies or spin–orbit effects).\nPhonon: An emergent acoustic mode from broken translational symmetry in a discrete lattice—an approximate Goldstone boson valid at long wavelengths.\nPion: A pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral SU(2)×SU(2) in QCD, acquiring a finite mass through explicit quark-mass terms.\nSkyrmion: A topological soliton in the nonlinear sigma model of pions; it is not a gapless Goldstone mode but a stable field configuration supported by the vacuum’s broken chiral symmetry topology.\nReflexion CoT agent 9V8U, refining particle relationships, thinking: We have identified from prior analyses that magnons and phonons arise as Goldstone bosons of broken continuous symmetries in solids, pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and skyrmions are topological solitons in fields with broken symmetry rather than gapless modes.; answer: Magnon: Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of continuous spin-rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered solid.\nSkyrmion: Topological soliton in a field with underlying broken continuous symmetry, stabilized by topology rather than as a Goldstone mode.\nPion: Pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry in QCD, acquiring mass from explicit quark-mass terms.\nPhonon: Goldstone boson emerging from spontaneous breaking of continuous translational (and sometimes rotational) symmetry in a crystal lattice.\nCoT agent rLZP, determining non-associated particle, thinking: Magnons, phonons, and pions are all Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken symmetries.
