As a result, the symmetric law yields multiple equivalent ground states related by the symmetry, and the actual state ‘‘chooses’’ one of them, breaking the symmetry at the level of the observed vacuum. This leads to characteristic phenomena such as the appearance of massless (or light) Goldstone bosons for continuous broken symmetries and the generation of particle masses through mechanisms like the Higgs effect.\nCoT-SC agent prvC, characterizing particles, thinking: Magnons, pions, and phonons are standard examples of Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) bosons arising from spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries: spin-rotational symmetry for magnons, chiral symmetry for pions, and translational symmetry for phonons. Skyrmions are topological solitons—stable field configurations—not Goldstone bosons, so they are not directly tied to a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way.; answer: Magnon: Yes – Goldstone boson of broken spin-rotational symmetry.\nSkyrmion: No – topological soliton, not a Goldstone mode.\nPion: Yes – (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of broken chiral symmetry in QCD.\nPhonon: Yes – Goldstone boson of broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\nCoT-SC agent o9gK, characterizing particles, thinking: To determine association with spontaneously-broken symmetry, identify which excitations are Goldstone modes: magnons from broken spin rotation, phonons from broken translation, pions from broken chiral symmetry—whereas skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone bosons.; answer: • Magnon: Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken spin-rotational symmetry\n• Skyrmion: Topological soliton; not a Goldstone mode (not directly tied to a broken continuous symmetry)\n• Pion: (Pseudo-)Goldstone boson from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry\n• Phonon: Goldstone boson from spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry\nCoT-SC agent 28Bn, characterizing particles, thinking: To determine which particles are tied to spontaneously-broken symmetries, examine each: magnons are spin‐wave excitations in magnets where spin‐rotation symmetry is broken; skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes; pions act as (pseudo)‐Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD; phonons arise from broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals.; answer: Magnon: yes (Goldstone mode of broken spin‐rotation symmetry)\nSkyrmion: no (topological soliton, not from a broken continuous symmetry)\nPion: yes (pseudo‐Goldstone boson of broken chiral symmetry)\nPhonon: yes (Goldstone mode of broken translational symmetry)\nReflexion CoT agent 881z, evaluating particle characteristics, thinking: In sub-task 3 we check if each excitation arises as a Goldstone mode of a broken continuous symmetry. Magnons come from broken spin‐rotational symmetry, pions (pseudo) from broken chiral symmetry, phonons from broken translational symmetry in a lattice. Skyrmions are topological solitons, stable field configurations, not Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry.; answer: Magnon: associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nSkyrmion: not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nPion: associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nPhonon: associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nConclusion: Skyrmion is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nCritic agent GAQs, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that magnons, pions, and phonons arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes of broken continuous symmetries, while skyrmions are topological solitons rather than Goldstone bosons. Its limitations are:\n1. It treats chiral symmetry breaking for pions as exact, whereas in reality quark masses give only an approximate (pseudo-)Goldstone boson.\n2. It assumes an ideal crystalline lattice for phonons, but translational symmetry is explicitly broken by the lattice potential itself—phonons are emergent rather than fundamental Goldstone modes.\n3. It does not discuss the requirement of long-range order for magnons (spin-rotational symmetry must be broken at low temperature).\n4. It overlooks that in some materials skyrmions arise due to specific interactions (e.g. Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya) which relate to other broken symmetries, though the skyrmion itself is still not a Goldstone mode.\n5. It doesn’t address the difference between collective excitations (condensed matter) and particle physics contexts.\nThese caveats should be noted when generalizing the classification.; answer: Skyrmion\nReflexion CoT agent 881z, refining particle evaluation, thinking: To evaluate, I check whether each excitation arises as a Goldstone mode from a broken continuous symmetry: magnons from spin‐rotational symmetry, pions (pseudo) from chiral symmetry, phonons from translational symmetry, while skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes.; answer: Magnon: associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nSkyrmion: not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nPion: associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nPhonon: associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nConclusion: Skyrmion is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nCritic agent GAQs, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that magnons, pions, and phonons arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes of broken continuous symmetries, and that skyrmions are topological solitons rather than Goldstone excitations. However, it omits nuances such as pions being pseudo-Goldstone bosons due to explicit chiral symmetry breaking (nonzero quark masses) and doesn’t discuss conditions under which phonons may acquire gaps (e.g., in discrete lattices).; answer: Skyrmion\nReflexion CoT agent 881z, refining particle evaluation, thinking: We check each excitation: Magnons arise as Goldstone modes of broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets; Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry in QCD; Phonons are Goldstone modes of broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals; Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry.; answer: Magnon: Yes – associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nSkyrmion: No – not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nPion: Yes – associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (pseudo-Goldstone).\nPhonon: Yes – associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nCritic agent GAQs, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that magnons, pions, and phonons arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes of broken continuous symmetries, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons. Limitations of this assessment include:\n1. Approximate versus exact symmetry breaking: Pions are only pseudo‐Goldstone bosons because chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by quark masses, and phonons in real crystals reflect the breaking of discrete rather than truly continuous translations.  \n2. Anisotropies and interactions: Magnons acquire gaps when spin‐rotational symmetry is broken by spin–orbit coupling or anisotropies.  \n3. Context dependence: Skyrmions in some field theories can carry topological charges linked to underlying broken symmetries, so labeling them purely “not associated” may oversimplify certain models.\n4. Scope of “effective particles”: The classification assumes linear excitations; solitonic objects like skyrmions have collective dynamics beyond small fluctuations.\n\nThese caveats mean the yes/no labels hold in idealized limits but require refinement in realistic systems.; answer: Skyrmion\nReflexion CoT agent 881z, refining particle evaluation, thinking: Each excitation is checked against being a Goldstone mode from a broken continuous symmetry: magnons from spin‐rotation, pions (pseudo) from chiral symmetry, phonons from translation, while skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes.; answer: Magnon: Yes – associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nSkyrmion: No – not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nPion: Yes – associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (pseudo-Goldstone boson).\nPhonon: Yes – associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\nDebate agent JynL, round 0, identifying particle, thinking: Magnon, pion, and phonon are Goldstone modes arising from broken continuous symmetries (spin rotation, chiral, and translational symmetry respectively).
