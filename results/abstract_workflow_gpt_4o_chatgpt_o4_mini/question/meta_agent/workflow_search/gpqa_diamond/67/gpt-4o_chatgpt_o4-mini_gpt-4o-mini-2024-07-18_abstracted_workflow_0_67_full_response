No extra info is missing.; answer: The spin-½ particle is initially in the Sz=+½ eigenstate (spin “up” along +Z), with the magnetic field B pointing along +Z.\nCoT-SC agent blLv, determining effect of field change, thinking: When the field is switched from +Z to +Y, the Hamiltonian changes from –γB\u2009Sz to –γB\u2009Sy. The initial Sz=+½ state is no longer an eigenstate and will undergo Larmor precession about the y-axis at frequency ω=γB. This causes the spin to rotate in the x–z plane, producing oscillations in ⟨Sz⟩ and ⟨Sx⟩.; answer: The spin will precess about the Y‐axis at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, so the initial |Sz=+½⟩ state rotates in the X–Z plane. ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB\u2009t), ⟨Sx⟩(t)=(ħ/2)sin(γB\u2009t).\nCoT-SC agent WtWJ, determining effect of field change, thinking: With the field switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γS·B=−γB\u2009Sy. The initial |↑_z⟩ state is no longer an energy eigenstate, so it undergoes Larmor precession about the y–axis at ω=γB. The spin expectation vector thus rotates in the x–z plane, making ⟨S_z⟩(t) oscillate as (½)cos(γB\u2009t).; answer: The spin precesses about the y-axis at angular frequency ω=γB, causing the z-component expectation ⟨S_z⟩ to oscillate as (½)cos(γB\u2009t).\nCoT-SC agent usze, determining effect of field change, thinking: With the field switched to +Y the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009Sy. The spin initially in Sz=+½ will thus undergo Larmor precession about the Y-axis at ω=γB, evolving into superpositions of Sz eigenstates and causing Sz to oscillate.; answer: The spin will precess about the Y-axis at angular frequency ω=γB, converting the initial Sz=+½ state into a time-dependent superposition and causing ⟨Sz⟩ to oscillate as (½)cos(γBt).\nReflexion CoT agent j2Jf, understanding quantum behavior, thinking: The system initially in Sz=+½ eigenstate undergoes Larmor precession about the new Y‐axis field at angular frequency ω=γB, causing its Z‐component to oscillate as ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB t).; answer: The magnetic moment oscillates at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, with ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB t).\nCritic agent GXqA, providing feedback, thinking: The chain-of-thought correctly identifies Larmor precession at ω=γB as governing ⟨Sz⟩(t). However, it relies on a semiclassical picture of the spin expectation value. It omits discussion of the full two-level quantum state evolution under H=−γB Sy, assumes an abrupt field switch (sudden approximation), neglects decoherence and relaxation, and treats ⟨Sz⟩ as an ensemble average without accounting for measurement collapse or environmental coupling.; answer: A more complete quantum description starts with |ψ(0)⟩=|Sz=+⟩ written in the Sy eigenbasis: |ψ(0)⟩=(|Sy=+⟩+|Sy=–⟩)/√2. Under H=−γB Sy, the state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩=(e^{−iγB t/2}|Sy=+⟩+e^{+iγB t/2}|Sy=–⟩)/√2, giving ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB t). Limitations: assumes instantaneous field switching, an isolated spin (no decoherence or relaxation), and ignores projective measurement back-action and environmental coupling.\nReflexion CoT agent j2Jf, refining quantum behavior understanding, thinking: The sub-task asks for the quantum evolution of a spin-½ under a suddenly switched magnetic field from +Z to +Y. This is well-posed: the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009Sy, leading to Larmor precession at ω=γB. The expectation ⟨Sz⟩(t) oscillates as (ħ/2)cos(γB\u2009t). Limitations include the sudden‐switch (sudden approximation), neglect of decoherence/relaxation, and that ⟨Sz⟩ is an ensemble average ignoring measurement back‐action.; answer: Under H=−γB\u2009Sy the initial |Sz=+½⟩ state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩=e^{iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ}|Sz=+½⟩, giving ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). This result assumes an instantaneous field switch, no decoherence or relaxation processes, and treats ⟨Sz⟩ purely as an ensemble average without including measurement collapse or environmental coupling.\nCritic agent GXqA, providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning correctly identifies that after the field suddenly switches to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009Sy, leading to Larmor precession at ω=γB and yielding ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB\u2009t). The main limitations are: (1) the sudden‐switch approximation which ignores finite ramp‐up times; (2) neglect of decoherence, relaxation, and environmental coupling; and (3) treating ⟨Sz⟩ purely as an ensemble average without accounting for measurement back‐action or collapse.; answer: gamma*B\nReflexion CoT agent j2Jf, refining quantum behavior understanding, thinking: To address Sub-task 3 I note that after the field switches from +Z to +Y the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009Sy. The initial Sz=+½ eigenstate is not an eigenstate of Sy, so it undergoes Larmor precession about the Y‐axis at angular frequency ω=γB. One computes the time‐evolution operator U(t)=exp(iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ) acting on |Sz=+½⟩ and finds ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB\u2009t). Limitations of this treatment are: (1) the sudden‐switch approximation ignores any finite ramp time of the field; (2) decoherence and relaxation (environmental coupling) are neglected; and (3) ⟨Sz⟩ is treated as an ensemble average without accounting for measurement back‐action or collapse.; answer: Under H=−γB\u2009Sy the initial |Sz=+½⟩ state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩=e^{iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ}|Sz=+½⟩, giving ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). Limitations include the sudden‐switch approximation (ignoring field ramp times), neglect of decoherence/relaxation (environmental coupling), and treating ⟨Sz⟩ purely as an ensemble average without measurement back‐action or collapse.\nCritic agent GXqA, providing feedback, thinking: The explanation correctly identifies that after switching the field to +Y the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB\u2009Sy, that the initial |Sz=+½〉 state precesses about Y at the Larmor frequency ω = γB, and that ⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2)\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). The listed limitations—the sudden‐switch (instantaneous) approximation, neglect of decoherence/relaxation, and treating ⟨Sz⟩ as an ensemble average without accounting for measurement back‐action—are all appropriate.; answer: Under H = -γB\u2009Sy the initial |Sz=+½〉 state evolves as |ψ(t)〉 = exp(iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ)|Sz=+½〉, yielding ⟨Sz⟩(t) = (ħ/2)\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). Limitations: (1) sudden‐switch ignores finite field‐ramp times; (2) no decoherence or relaxation (environmental coupling) is included; (3) measurement back‐action/collapse is not modeled in the ensemble‐average ⟨Sz⟩.\nReflexion CoT agent j2Jf, refining quantum behavior understanding, thinking: Sub-task 3 asks for the quantum evolution of a spin-½ initially aligned along +Z when the field is abruptly switched to +Y. The Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009Sy, so the state undergoes Larmor precession about the Y-axis. Using U(t)=exp(iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ) on |Sz=+½〉 yields ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(γB\u2009t). This treatment assumes an instantaneous field switch, neglects decoherence and relaxation, and treats ⟨Sz⟩ purely as an ensemble average without measurement back-action.; answer: Under H=−γB\u2009Sy the initial |Sz=+½〉 state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩=e^{iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ}|Sz=+½⟩, giving ⟨Sz⟩(t)=(ħ/2)\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). Limitations: (1) sudden‐switch approximation (ignores finite ramp time); (2) neglects decoherence and relaxation; (3) treats ⟨Sz⟩ as an ensemble average without accounting for measurement back-action or collapse.\nCoT agent cBfL, calculating oscillation frequency, thinking: Under a magnetic field along +Y, the spin undergoes Larmor precession about the Y-axis with frequency ω = γB, leading to oscillations of ⟨Sz⟩ at that frequency.; answer: B)\nDebate agent ZrRy, round 0, comparing frequency with choices, thinking: The calculated oscillation frequency is ω=γB.
