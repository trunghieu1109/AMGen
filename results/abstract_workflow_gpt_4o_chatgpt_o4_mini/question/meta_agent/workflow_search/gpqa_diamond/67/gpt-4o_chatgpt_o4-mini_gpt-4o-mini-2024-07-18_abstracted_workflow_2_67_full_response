The magnetic moment is μ=γ\u2009S_z.\nCoT-SC agent 6aJV, determining effect of magnetic field change, thinking: The spin-½ particle is initially in an eigenstate of Sz. Switching off Bz and switching on By makes Sz no longer conserved. The new Hamiltonian is H=−γBySy, so the Bloch vector precesses about the y‐axis at ω=γB.; answer: The spin, initially aligned along +Z, will precess around the new +Y field at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, causing the z‐component of the magnetic moment to oscillate in time.\nCoT-SC agent Hp1L, determining effect of magnetic field change, thinking: When the field is switched from +Z to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009S_y, so the spin state precesses about the y–axis at the Larmor frequency ω=γB. This causes the z–component to oscillate in time.; answer: The spin precesses around the +Y axis at Larmor frequency ω=γB, so its z-component oscillates as ⟨Sz(t)⟩=(ħ/2)cos(γB\u2009t).\nCoT-SC agent zB2P, determining effect of magnetic field change, thinking: With the field switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009Sy. The initial |Sz=+ℏ/2〉 state is therefore a superposition of Sy eigenstates and will precess around the Y-axis. This yields time-dependent Sz expectation oscillating at the Larmor frequency ω=γB.; answer: The spin precesses about the Y-axis at ω=γB, so ⟨Sz⟩= (ℏ/2)cos(γB\u2009t).\nReflexion CoT agent xRVS, applying Larmor precession, thinking: The new Hamiltonian H=−γB\u2009Sy yields Larmor precession about the y-axis at ω=γB, so the z-component oscillates at frequency γB.; answer: B)\nCritic agent qH0v, providing feedback, thinking: The solution correctly applies Larmor precession: with H = –γB Sy, the spin precesses about the y-axis at ω = γB, causing ⟨Sz⟩ to oscillate at that frequency.; answer: gamma*B\nReflexion CoT agent xRVS, refining Larmor precession application, thinking: The Hamiltonian after switching fields is H=−γB\u2009Sy, leading to Larmor precession about the y-axis at angular frequency ω=γB. Therefore the z-component oscillates at γB.; answer: B)\nCritic agent qH0v, providing feedback, thinking: The Larmor precession concept is applied correctly. With the field along +Y, the Hamiltonian H = -γ B Sy indeed yields precession about the y-axis at angular frequency ω = γ B, so the z-component oscillates at γ B. The argument is concise and accurate.; answer: gamma*B\nReflexion CoT agent xRVS, refining Larmor precession application, thinking: The Hamiltonian after switching fields is H = –γB Sy, which leads to Larmor precession about the y-axis at angular frequency ω = γB. Therefore the z-component oscillates at ω = γB.; answer: B)\nCritic agent qH0v, providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning correctly identifies the Hamiltonian H = -γB Sy and applies Larmor precession about the y-axis, yielding an oscillation frequency ω = γB. The average z-component then oscillates at this frequency. This is a clear and accurate application of Larmor precession.; answer: gamma*B\nReflexion CoT agent xRVS, refining Larmor precession application, thinking: With the field switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -γB Sy, giving Larmor precession about y at ω = γB. Thus the z-component oscillates at ω = γB.; answer: B)\nReflexion CoT agent zhv9, evaluating frequency relationship, thinking: The z-component oscillates at the same rate as the spin precesses about the y-axis, so the oscillation frequency of μ_z equals the Larmor precession frequency ω=γB.; answer: The oscillation frequency of μ_z is equal to the Larmor precession frequency, ω=γB.\nCritic agent cj00, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation is accurate. The z‐component oscillates at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, matching the precession rate around the y‐axis.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent zhv9, refining frequency relationship evaluation, thinking: The z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as the spin precesses about the y-axis. Since the precession occurs at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, the z-component oscillates at the same rate.; answer: The oscillation frequency of μ_z equals the Larmor precession frequency, ω = γB.\nCritic agent cj00, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly links the oscillation of μ_z to the Larmor precession at ω = γB. The reasoning is sound and the conclusion is accurate.; answer: γB\nReflexion CoT agent zhv9, refining frequency relationship evaluation, thinking: The spin precesses about the y-axis at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, and the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates at the same rate.; answer: The oscillation frequency of μ_z equals the Larmor precession frequency, ω = γB.\nCritic agent cj00, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation is correct: the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates at the Larmor precession frequency ω = γB.; answer: γB\nReflexion CoT agent zhv9, refining frequency relationship evaluation, thinking: The spin precesses about the new +Y field at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, and since μ_z oscillates with the precession, its oscillation frequency equals ω=γB.; answer: B)\nDebate agent GhZB, round 0, selecting correct frequency, thinking: The Larmor precession frequency about the Y‐axis is ω=γB, and the z‐component oscillates at this same frequency.; answer: B)\nDebate agent sD2R, round 0, selecting correct frequency, thinking: The oscillation frequency of μ_z matches the Larmor precession frequency ω=γB, so the correct choice is B).; answer: B)\nDebate agent 039g, round 0, selecting correct frequency, thinking: The spin precesses about the new +Y field at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, so the z-component oscillates at the same frequency.; answer: B)\nDebate agent BkLJ, round 0, selecting correct frequency, thinking: The spin precesses about the new field at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, and μ_z oscillates at this frequency.
