    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?&#39;, choice1=&#39;28&#39;, choice2=&#39;40&#39;, choice3=&#39;68&#39;, choice4=&#39;54&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Select the correct Lorentz factor from the given choices (28, 40, 68, 54) that matches the calculated requirement for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detectors inner walls. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 0zPB:
Using P = exp(-R/(γcτ₀)) and given at γ = 20 we have P = 1/3 ⇒ cτ₀ = R/(20 ln3). For P = 2/3, γ = R/(cτ₀ ln(3/2)) = 20·ln3/ln(3/2) ≈ 54.2, so the closest provided choice is 54.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 3VWX:
Using the decay probability P=exp(-R/(γcτ₀)), at γ=20 and P=1/3 we find cτ₀=R/(20 ln3). For P=2/3, solving γ=R/(cτ₀ ln(3/2)) gives γ≈20·ln3/ln(3/2)≈54.2, so the closest choice is 54.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent tuZD:
Using the decay probability relation P=exp(-R/(γcτ₀)), obtaining cτ₀ from P=1/3 at γ=20 gives cτ₀=R/(20 ln3). Solving P=2/3 yields γ=20·ln3/ln(3/2)≈54.2, so the closest choice is 54.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent yrpP:
Using the decay probability P=exp(-R/(γcτ₀)), with P=1/3 at γ=20 giving cτ₀=R/(20 ln3), and for P=2/3 we solve γ=R/(cτ₀ ln(3/2))=20·ln3/ln(3/2)≈54.2, so the closest choice is 54.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct Lorentz factor.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
