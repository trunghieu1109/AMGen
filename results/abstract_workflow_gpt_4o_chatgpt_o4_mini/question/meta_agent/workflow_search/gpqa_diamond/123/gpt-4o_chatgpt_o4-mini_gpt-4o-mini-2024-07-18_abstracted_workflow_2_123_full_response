Solving for λ gives λ=R/(−ln\u20091/3)=30\u2009m/1.0986≈27.3\u2009m, which is the average distance traveled before decay.; answer: 27.3 meters\nCoT-SC agent kb2x, determining relationship, thinking: In the particle’s rest frame its decay length is c·τ0; in the lab frame time dilation by γ increases this to λ=γ·β·c·τ0 (with β≈1 at ultra‐relativistic speeds), so the mean travel distance grows linearly with γ.; answer: The mean decay length λ in the lab frame scales as λ=γ·β·c·τ0 ≈γ·c·τ0, i.e. proportional to the Lorentz factor γ.\nCoT-SC agent jnHy, determining relationship, thinking: The lab-frame decay length λ is length-contracted by time dilation: λ=γvτ₀≈γcτ₀ for ultra‐relativistic β≈1, so the distance traveled grows linearly with γ.; answer: The mean decay length scales linearly with the Lorentz factor: λ=γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀\nCoT-SC agent lg9S, determining relationship, thinking: The proper lifetime τ₀ is dilated in the lab frame by the Lorentz factor γ, and the particle travels at v≈c, so the mean decay length is λ_lab=γβcτ₀≈γcτ₀, i.e. it scales linearly with γ.; answer: The lab-frame decay length λ=γ β c τ₀≈γ c τ₀, so the distance traveled before decaying grows linearly with the Lorentz factor γ.\nReflexion CoT agent pSDv, applying relationship, thinking: We need survival probability P=2/3=exp(−R/λ), so λ=−R/ln(P)=30\u2009m/0.4055≈74\u2009m. Since λ grows ∝γ and at γ≈20 λ≈27.3\u2009m, γ_needed=74/27.3×20≈54.; answer: D)\nCritic agent fLDi, providing feedback, thinking: The agent correctly applied the survival probability P = exp(−R/λ) to find λ ≃ 30/−ln(2/3) ≃ 74 m and then used the proportionality λ∝γ with the known λ ≃ 27.3 m at γ=20. This yields γ ≃ (74/27.3)×20 ≃ 54. The reasoning and arithmetic are sound.; answer: 54\nReflexion CoT agent pSDv, refining application, thinking: For two-thirds survival, use P=exp(−R/λ)=2/3 → λ=−R/ln(2/3)≈30/0.4055≈74\u2009m. Since λ∝γ and at γ≈20 λ≈27.3\u2009m, γ_needed=(74/27.3)×20≈54.; answer: D)\nCritic agent fLDi, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation is sound: starting from P=exp(−R/λ)=2/3 gives λ=−R/ln(2/3)≈74\u2009m. Since at γ≈20 one finds λ≈30/ln3≈27.3\u2009m, the Lorentz factor scales linearly, yielding γ≈(74/27.3)×20≈54.; answer: 54\nReflexion CoT agent pSDv, refining application, thinking: We require survival probability P=2/3=exp(−R/λ) so λ=−R/ln(P)=30\u2009m/0.4055≈74\u2009m. Since λ∝γ and at γ≈20 yields λ≈27.3\u2009m, the needed Lorentz factor is γ≈(74/27.3)×20≈54.; answer: D)\nCritic agent fLDi, providing feedback, thinking: The solution correctly applies the survival probability P=exp(–R/λ) to find λ=–R/ln(P)≈74 m for P=2/3, then uses the proportionality λ∝γ (with λ≈27.3 m at γ=20) to scale γ by 74/27.3, giving γ≈54. The reasoning and calculations are sound.; answer: 54\nReflexion CoT agent pSDv, refining application, thinking: To achieve a 2/3 survival probability, use P = exp(–R/λ) ⇒ λ = –R/ln(2/3) ≈ 30 m/0.4055 ≈ 74 m.
