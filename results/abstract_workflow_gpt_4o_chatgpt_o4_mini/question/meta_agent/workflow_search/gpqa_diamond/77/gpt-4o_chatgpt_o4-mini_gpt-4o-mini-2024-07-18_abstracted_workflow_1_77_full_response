This clearly falls under classical electrodynamics (Maxwell’s equations) and specifically uses the retarded (Lienard–Wiechert) potentials in the Lorenz gauge.; answer: The relevant theory is Maxwell’s equations in the Lorenz gauge, which lead to the retarded (Liénard–Wiechert) potentials. For a point charge q with trajectory s(t) and velocity v at the retarded time tr defined by |r−s(tr)|=c(t−tr), one has:\n\nV(r,t)= q/(4πε0)·1/[Rret(1−n·β)]\nA(r,t)= μ0q/(4π)·β/[Rret(1−n·β)]\n\nwhere Rret=|r−s(tr)|, n=(r−s(tr))/Rret, and β=v/c.\nCoT-SC agent puPS, applying retarded time concept, thinking: To apply retarded time, we use the condition that signals propagate at light speed. The retarded time tr is defined implicitly by the light‐cone equation c(t−tr)=|r−s(tr)|. At this time the charge is at s(tr) with velocity v=s˙(tr), and the displacement vector to the field point is d=r−s(tr).; answer: At the retarded time tr defined by c(t−tr)=|r−s(tr)|, the charge’s emission point is s(tr), its velocity is v=s˙(tr), and the observer‐source vector is d=r−s(tr).\nCoT-SC agent eKg2, applying retarded time concept, thinking: The sub-task asks to relate the charge’s position and velocity at the retarded time to the observation point. Retarded time is defined by the light‐travel condition, giving a direct relation between the source trajectory at emission and the field point.; answer: The retarded time t_r is defined by the implicit equation c\nt   – t_r) = |r – s(t_r)|. Define d = r – s(t_r), so |d| = c(t – t_r). The velocity at the emission instant is v = ˙s(t_r). These relations link the charge’s position s(t_r) and velocity v at t_r to the observation point r at time t.\nCoT-SC agent euez, applying retarded time concept, thinking: We need to state the light‐cone (retardation) condition that fixes the emission time tr in terms of observation time t and point r. Then express the charge’s position s(tr) and velocity v(tr) at that time and define the vector d from emission to observation.; answer: The retarded time tr is defined implicitly by |r − s(tr)| = c\u2009(t − tr). At tr the charge’s position is s(tr) and its velocity is v(tr). The vector from the emission point to the observation point is d = r − s(tr), with magnitude d = |d|. Thus s(tr), v(tr), and d determined by this condition link the source motion to the field point.\nReflexion CoT agent ZTC9, deriving scalar potential, thinking: Starting from the Liénard–Wiechert scalar potential in the Lorenz gauge for a point charge, one has\nV(r,t)=q/(4πε₀R_ret(1−n·β)),\nwith R_ret=|d|=|r−s(t_r)| and n·β=(v·d)/(c|d|).

However, it silently assumes several conditions that limit its applicability.; answer: Key limitations of this derivation:\n1. Assumes a classical point charge in free space (no extended charge distributions or media).\n2. Requires subluminal motion (|v|<c) so that the retarded‐time equation has a unique real solution.\n3.

Its validity is limited to a point charge moving at subluminal speeds (|v|<c) in free space, with a uniquely defined retarded time.

Point‐Charge Assumption: Valid only for a true point charge; fails for extended charge distributions.\n2. Gauge Dependence: Derivation relies on the Lorenz gauge; other gauges yield extra terms or require additional potentials.\n3.
