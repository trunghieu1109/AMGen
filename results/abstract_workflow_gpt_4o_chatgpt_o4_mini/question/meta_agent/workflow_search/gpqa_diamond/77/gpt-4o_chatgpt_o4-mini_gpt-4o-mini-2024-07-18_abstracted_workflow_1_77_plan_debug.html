Example(question=&#39;Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t &gt; tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$?

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the relevant electromagnetic theory and equations for scalar potential (V) and vector potential (ecA) for a moving point charge. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HgDw:
The question asks for the foundational theory and equations needed to write the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge. This clearly falls under classical electrodynamics (Maxwell’s equations) and specifically uses the retarded (Lienard–Wiechert) potentials in the Lorenz gauge.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent HgDw:
The relevant theory is Maxwell’s equations in the Lorenz gauge, which lead to the retarded (Liénard–Wiechert) potentials. For a point charge q with trajectory s(t) and velocity v at the retarded time tr defined by |r−s(tr)|=c(t−tr), one has:

V(r,t)= q/(4πε0)·1/[Rret(1−n·β)]
A(r,t)= μ0q/(4π)·β/[Rret(1−n·β)]

where Rret=|r−s(tr)|, n=(r−s(tr))/Rret, and β=v/c.

### Sub-task 2: Apply the concept of retarded time to relate the position and velocity of the charge at the field-generating instant to the observation point. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent puPS:
To apply retarded time, we use the condition that signals propagate at light speed. The retarded time tr is defined implicitly by the light‐cone equation c(t−tr)=|r−s(tr)|. At this time the charge is at s(tr) with velocity v=s˙(tr), and the displacement vector to the field point is d=r−s(tr).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent puPS:
At the retarded time tr defined by c(t−tr)=|r−s(tr)|, the charge’s emission point is s(tr), its velocity is v=s˙(tr), and the observer‐source vector is d=r−s(tr).

### Sub-task 3: Derive the expression for the scalar potential V(ecr, t) using the identified equations and the concept of retarded time. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZTC9:
Starting from the Liénard–Wiechert scalar potential in the Lorenz gauge, V(r,t)=q/[4πε₀R_ret(1−n·β)], with R_ret=|d| and n·β=(d·v)/(c|d|). Substitution and algebraic simplification gives V(r,t)=qc/[4πε₀(c|d|−d·v)].

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZTC9:
V(r,t)=qc/(4πε₀(c d−d·v))

### Sub-task 4: Derive the expression for the vector potential ecA(ecr, t) using the identified equations and the concept of retarded time. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrCz (yourself):
The vector potential follows directly from the Liénard–Wiechert potentials in the Lorenz gauge. Using A(r,t)=μ₀q c β/[4π(c d−d·v)] and β=v/c, we get A(r,t)=μ₀q v/[4π(c d−d·v)].

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrCz (yourself):
A(r,t)=\frac{\mu_o q\,\vec v}{4\pi\bigl(c\,d-\vec d\cdot\vec v\bigr)}

### please review the vector potential derivation and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent So6U:
The derivation correctly starts from the Liénard–Wiechert potentials in the Lorenz gauge and yields the standard vector potential
A(r,t)=μ₀q v(t_r) / [4π(c d – d·v(t_r))]. Limitations include:
1. Point‐charge idealization: ignores finite size and charge distribution.
2. Neglect of acceleration within the retardation interval: valid only if v changes slowly compared to d/c.
3. No radiation‐reaction or self‐force effects are included.
4. Singular behavior if c d = d·v (when charge approaches observer at light‐speed direction).
5. Assumes unique solution for the retarded time; advanced potentials and boundary conditions are omitted.

### Sub-task 4: Derive the expression for the vector potential ecA(ecr, t) using the identified equations and the concept of retarded time. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrCz (yourself):
Starting from the Liénard–Wiechert vector potential in the Lorenz gauge, A(r,t)=μ₀q c β / [4π(c d−d·v)] with β=v/c, substitution yields A(r,t)=μ₀q v / [4π(c d−d·v)], where d=r−s(t_r).

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrCz (yourself):
A(r,t) = μ₀ q v / [4π (c d − d·v)]

### please review the vector potential derivation and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent So6U:
The derived expression A(r,t)=μ₀ q v(t_r)/[4π(c d−d·v(t_r))] is indeed the standard Liénard–Wiechert vector potential in the Lorenz gauge, obtained from the retarded‐time solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation for A. It correctly incorporates the charge’s instantaneous velocity at the retarded time and ensures causality via the denominator factor (c d−d·v).

### Sub-task 4: Derive the expression for the vector potential ecA(ecr, t) using the identified equations and the concept of retarded time. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrCz (yourself):
Starting from the Liénard–Wiechert vector potential in the Lorenz gauge, we use the known retarded solution A(r,t) = μ₀q c β / [4π(c d − d·v)] with β = v/c and d = r − s(t_r). Substituting β yields the standard result.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zrCz (yourself):
A(r,t) = μ₀ q v(t_r) / [4π (c |d| − d·v(t_r))], with d = r − s(t_r) and t_r defined by c(t − t_r) = |d|.

### please review the vector potential derivation and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent So6U:
The derivation correctly recovers the standard Liénard–Wiechert vector potential in the Lorenz gauge, but it glosses over several important points: it does not explain the role of the Lorenz gauge condition in arriving at the retarded solution, assumes a point charge without discussing singular behaviour at the source or along the light‐cone, ignores radiation‐reaction/self‐force (no back‐reaction from emitted fields), and does not address the breakdown of the formula as v→c or for accelerated motion in the near field.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Derive the expression for the vector potential ecA(ecr, t) using the identified equations and the concept of retarded time.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Starting from the Liénard–Wiechert retarded potentials in the Lorenz gauge, the vector potential A satisfies the inhomogeneous wave equation. Its solution for a point charge q moving with velocity v at the retarded time t_r gives the standard form by substituting β=v/c into A(r,t)=μ₀q c β/[4π(c|d|−d·v)].
