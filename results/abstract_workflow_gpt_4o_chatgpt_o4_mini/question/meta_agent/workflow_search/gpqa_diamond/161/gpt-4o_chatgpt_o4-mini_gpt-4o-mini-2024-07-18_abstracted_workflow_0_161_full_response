This shows it is conformally flat, with a conformal factor that vanishes at r=2, indicating a boundary/singularity at that radius. Computing K via K=−(1/Ω^2)Δ lnΩ gives a constant negative curvature, confirming it describes a pseudosphere with boundary at r=2.; answer: The metric is conformally flat on the disk r<2 with conformal factor Ω^2=(3/2)(4−r^2). It has constant negative Gaussian curvature K=−1/2, and the circle r=2 is a singular boundary, corresponding to the rim of the pseudosphere of ‘radius’ 2.\nCoT agent Ngb4, identifying relationship, thinking: The metric is conformally flat with a factor Ω^2=(3/2)(4−r^2) that vanishes at r=2, so it maps the Euclidean disk r<2 to a surface of constant negative curvature (the pseudosphere) by stretching lengths according to Ω. Thus it captures the intrinsic geometry of the pseudosphere via a conformal parametrization.; answer: The metric ds²=(3/2)(4−r²)(dx²+dy²) is a conformal parametrization of the pseudosphere: the factor Ω²=(3/2)(4−r²) induces constant negative curvature K=−1/2 on the disk r<2, and the boundary r=2 corresponds to the rim of the pseudosphere.\nCoT agent yIYx, determining area formula, thinking: The area is given by integrating dA = (32/(4−r²))(r dr dθ) over 0≤r<2 and 0≤θ<2π.
