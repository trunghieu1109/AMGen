    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, choice1=&#39;10 MeV.&#39;, choice2=&#39;5 MeV.&#39;, choice3=&#39;2 MeV.&#39;, choice4=&#39;20 MeV.&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using relativistic mechanics. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xlzv:
We have initial M c^2=300 GeV. Fragments: m1=0.66M→198 GeV, m2=0.33M→99 GeV. Total KE=3 GeV. By momentum conservation p satisfies √(198²+p²)+√(99²+p²)=300. Numerically p≈19.9 GeV/c. Then E1=√(198²+19.9²)≈199.0 GeV, so T1=E1−198≈1.0 GeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xlzv:
1.0 GeV

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent NxBg:
In classical mechanics, momentum conservation implies both fragments have equal and opposite momentum p. Total KE E = p^2/(2m1)+p^2/(2m2)=p^2/2*(1/m1+1/m2). Thus p^2/2 = E/(1/m1+1/m2). The KE of fragment 1 is p^2/(2m1)=E*(1/m1)/(1/m1+1/m2)=E*m2/(m1+m2). With m1=0.66M, m2=0.33M, E=3 GeV, we get KE1=3 GeV*(0.33/0.99)=1 GeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent NxBg:
1 GeV.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine the difference between the kinetic energy values obtained from relativistic and classical calculations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
