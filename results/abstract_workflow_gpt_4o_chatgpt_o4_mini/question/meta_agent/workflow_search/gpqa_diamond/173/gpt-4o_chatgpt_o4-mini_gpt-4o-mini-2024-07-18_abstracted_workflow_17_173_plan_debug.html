    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, choice1=&#39;10 MeV.&#39;, choice2=&#39;5 MeV.&#39;, choice3=&#39;2 MeV.&#39;, choice4=&#39;20 MeV.&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values of the more massive fragment. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent DWSR:
First‐order relativistic calculation gives T1 ≃1.005 GeV vs classical 1.000 GeV, so ΔT ≃0.005 GeV = 5 MeV, corresponding to option B).

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent DWSR:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Select the correct answer choice that matches the calculated difference in kinetic energy.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
