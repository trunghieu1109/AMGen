    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?&#39;, choice1=&#39;96&#39;, choice2=&#39;74&#39;, choice3=&#39;138&#39;, choice4=&#39;172&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Determine the energy of each photon using the conservation laws. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent YPc2:
The total initial energy is 3.066 MeV and the two photons share it equally (given equal measured energies), so each photon has half of 3.066 MeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent YPc2:
1.533 MeV

### Sub-task 8: Determine the momentum of each photon using the conservation laws. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZX0q:
We know from sub‐task 4 that the total initial energy is E_tot=(γ1+γ2)m_ec^2=3.066 MeV and total momentum P_x=1.095 MeV/c. After annihilation two photons share energy equally so E_γ=1.533 MeV and p_γ=E_γ/c=1.533 MeV/c. Their emission is symmetric about the x‐axis, giving P_x=2p_γ cosφ=1.095 MeV/c ⇒cosφ=0.357 ⇒φ≈69°. Thus each photon has p_x=0.547 MeV/c and p_y=±1.431 MeV/c.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZX0q:
Magnitude of each photon: p_γ=1.533 MeV/c with vector components (p_x,p_y)=(0.547 MeV/c,±1.431 MeV/c)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Calculate the angle between the directions of the photons using vector analysis.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have photon momenta p1=(0.547,1.431) MeV/c and p2=(0.547,-1.431) MeV/c. The dot product is 0.547^2 - 1.431^2 = -1.7478 (MeV/c)^2. Each magnitude is 1.533 MeV/c. Thus cosθ = -1.7478 / (1.533^2) ≈ -0.745, giving θ ≈ arccos(-0.745) ≈ 138°.
