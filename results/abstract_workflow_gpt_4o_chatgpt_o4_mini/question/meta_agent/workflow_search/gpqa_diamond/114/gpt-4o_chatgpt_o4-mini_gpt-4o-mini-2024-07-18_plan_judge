Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_114
proposed answer: Each photon is emitted at ±θ ≃69.1° relative to the +x-axis, so the angle between them is 2θ ≃138.2°, matching choice C.

proposed answer: We have photon momenta p1=(0.547,1.431) MeV/c and p2=(0.547,-1.431) MeV/c. The dot product is 0.547^2 - 1.431^2 = -1.7478 (MeV/c)^2. Each magnitude is 1.533 MeV/c. Thus cosθ = -1.7478 / (1.533^2) ≈ -0.745, giving θ ≈ arccos(-0.745) ≈ 138°.

Answer:138°
Extracted answer: 138°
Correct answer: 2
