Its key prerequisites are:\n• F must be C¹ (continuous first derivatives) throughout V and on ∂V.\n• V must be a bounded region with a well-defined, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary.  \nLimitations arise if any of these conditions fail—e.g., F has singularities or discontinuities inside V (as with 1/r² at the origin), ∂V is not smooth or not closed, V is not simply connected, or V is unbounded.  In such cases the divergence theorem does not directly apply or requires careful handling (e.g. excluding singular points or taking limits).\n\n### Sub-task 4: Apply the divergence theorem to relate the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the sphere\'s boundary.

However, it implicitly assumed the field is sufficiently well-behaved (continuous and continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the sphere. In fact, f(r)=1/r² is singular at r=0, so the standard divergence theorem does not strictly apply at the origin without treating it as a special point or using distributional (delta-function) methods.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Apply the divergence theorem to relate the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the sphere\'s boundary.

Its validity rests on key assumptions:\n1. The vector field f must be continuously differentiable (C¹) throughout V and on its boundary S.  \n2. The region V must be bounded by a piecewise-smooth, closed surface S.  \n3. There must be no singularities or discontinuities of f inside V.  \n\nLimitations:\n- If f has singularities within V (for example 1/r²\u2009r̂ at the origin), ∇·f may include delta‐function contributions, and the naive volume integral of ∇·f away from singular points misses those contributions.\n- If the boundary is not closed or not piecewise smooth, the theorem does not directly apply without modifications.\n- For fields not C¹ (e.g. with jumps or cusps), one must break V into subregions where f is smooth or use generalized divergence theorems in the sense of distributions.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Apply the divergence theorem to relate the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the sphere\'s boundary.
