I note it has only a radial component f_r=1/r^2, is singular at the origin, and its divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0 because ∇·f=(1/r^2)d/dr(r^2 f_r)=(1/r^2)d/dr(1)=0 for r>0.; answer: The field f(r)=1/r^2 is purely radial (f_r=1/r^2), singular at the origin, and for r>0 its divergence vanishes since ∇·f=(1/r^2)d/dr(r^2·1/r^2)=0.\nCoT-SC agent JN21, calculating divergence, thinking: The divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field f_r(r) is given by ∇·f = (1/r^2) d/dr (r^2 f_r). Substituting f_r = 1/r^2 gives ∇·f = (1/r^2) d/dr (1) = 0 for r>0, with a singularity at the origin.; answer: ∇·f = 0 (for r>0)\nCoT-SC agent ZvIz, calculating divergence, thinking: We apply the spherical‐coordinate divergence formula for a purely radial field f_r=1/r^2: ∇·f=(1/r^2)∂_r(r^2 f_r)=(1/r^2)∂_r(1)=0 for r>0. There’s a singularity at the origin, but the local divergence vanishes everywhere else.; answer: ∇·f=(1/r^2)∂/∂r(r^2·1/r^2)=0 for r>0\nCoT-SC agent MyVR, calculating divergence, thinking: In spherical coordinates with only a radial component f_r=1/r^2, the divergence is ∇·f = (1/r^2) d/dr [r^2 f_r] = (1/r^2) d/dr [1] = 0 for r>0.; answer: 0\nCoT agent MSas, setting up volume integral, thinking: The user asks to set up the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere.
