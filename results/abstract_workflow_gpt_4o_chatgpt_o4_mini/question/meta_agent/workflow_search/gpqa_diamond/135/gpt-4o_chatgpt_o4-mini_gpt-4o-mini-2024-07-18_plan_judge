Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_135
proposed answer: Applying the divergence theorem: ∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∮_S f·dS. On the sphere r=R, f = (1/R^2) r̂ and dS = R^2 sinθ dθ dφ r̂, so f·dS = sinθ dθ dφ. Integrating over θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π gives 4π.

proposed answer: The divergence of f(r)=1/r^2 is zero for r>0, but the total flux through the sphere is ∮f·dA=4π (Gauss’s law). Hence ∫∇·f dV=4π.
