The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors.

On the sphere r=R, f = (1/R^2) r\u0302 and dS = R^2 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 r\u0302, so f\u00b7dS = sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. Integrating over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 and \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0 gives 4\u03c0.\n\nAnswer:B)",
