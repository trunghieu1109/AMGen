    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?&#39;, choice1=&#39;7&#39;, choice2=&#39;8&#39;, choice3=&#39;10&#39;, choice4=&#39;4&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 9: Select and count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product 4. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent trTU:
Consensus from structural analysis and the provided multiple-choice context indicates ten chemically distinct hydrogen environments in product 4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Yu1k:
Despite missing full stereochemical details, the final tetracyclic ketone is expected to lack symmetry and present ten chemically distinct hydrogen environments—including distinct bridgehead, ring methine, and diastereotopic methylene protons—matching choice C).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent tMBS:
Based on ring fusions, substituents, and loss of symmetry upon cyclopropane opening and ketone formation, analysis yields ten chemically distinct hydrogen environments.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent PODe:
Although detailed stereochemical information is lacking, analysis of the final tetracyclic ketone—with diastereotopic bromomethyl protons and distinct bridgehead, methylene, and methine hydrogens—indicates ten chemically distinct hydrogen environments.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent trTU:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Yu1k:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent tMBS:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent PODe:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Make final decision on the number of distinct hydrogen atoms.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
