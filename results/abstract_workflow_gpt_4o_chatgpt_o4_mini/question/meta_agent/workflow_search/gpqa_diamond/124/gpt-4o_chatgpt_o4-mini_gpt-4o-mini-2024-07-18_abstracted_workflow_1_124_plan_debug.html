Example(question=&#39;Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hookeâ€™s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?&#39;, choice1=&#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10&#39;, choice2=&#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3&#39;, choice3=&#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10&#39;, choice4=&#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Determine the principal quantum number n for the third excited state. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the ground state corresponds to n=0, the first excited state to n=1, and so on. Therefore, the third excited state corresponds to n=3. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent WWIY:
The ground state corresponds to n=0, so the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WWIY:
n = 3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Determine the degeneracy of the energy level for the third excited state. The degeneracy of the nth energy level in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by (n+1)(n+2)/2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
