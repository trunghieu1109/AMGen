Example(question=&#39;Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?&#39;, choice1=&#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10&#39;, choice2=&#39;(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3&#39;, choice3=&#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10&#39;, choice4=&#39;11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the energy of the third excited state using the formula derived in subtask_3. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HzM2:
Using E_N=(N+3/2)ħω from subtask_3 and noting that the third excited state corresponds to N=3, we get E_3=(3+3/2)ħω=(9/2)ħω.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent HzM2:
(9/2) ħω

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on degeneracy. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 0WVu:
For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of the level with principal quantum number N is g(N) = (N+1)(N+2)/2. For the third excited state N=3 gives g(3) = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = 10.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 0WVu:
10

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated energy and degeneracy with the given choices to identify the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
