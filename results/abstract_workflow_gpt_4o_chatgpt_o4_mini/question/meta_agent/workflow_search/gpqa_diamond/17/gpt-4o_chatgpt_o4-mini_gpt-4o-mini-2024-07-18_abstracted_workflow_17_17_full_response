The solar reference A(Si)_☉ (12+log10(nSi/nH)) isn’t provided; assuming the typical value ≃7.51\u2009dex gives A(Si)_1 ≃7.81 and A(Si)_2 ≃7.21, so the ratio ≃10^(7.81−7.21)=10^0.6≈3.98 (~3.9). However, this hinges on that assumed solar Si abundance.\n\n### thinking #3 by Debate Agent K9IC:\nTo compute nSi1/nSi2 we use A(Si)_1 = A(Si)_☉ + [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 and A(Si)_2 = A(Si)_☉ + [Si/H]_2 with [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = -0.3.
