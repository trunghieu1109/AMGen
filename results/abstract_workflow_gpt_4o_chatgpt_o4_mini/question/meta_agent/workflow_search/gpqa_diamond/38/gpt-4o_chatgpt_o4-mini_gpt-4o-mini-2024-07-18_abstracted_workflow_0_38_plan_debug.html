Example(question=&#39;We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x&lt;1 and x&gt;3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?&#39;, choice1=&#39;0.85&#39;, choice2=&#39;1.1&#39;, choice3=&#39;0.35&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.6&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the value of a. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Wq6y:
From normalization ∫₁³[(a²/(1+x))+0.25]dx=1 ⇒ a²·ln2+0.5=1 ⇒ a²=0.5/ln2 ⇒ a≈0.85

### answer by Final Decision Agent Wq6y:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated value of a with the given choices to determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
