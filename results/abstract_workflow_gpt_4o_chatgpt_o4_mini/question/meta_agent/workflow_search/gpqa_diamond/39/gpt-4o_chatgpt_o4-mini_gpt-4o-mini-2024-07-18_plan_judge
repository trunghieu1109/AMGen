Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_39
proposed answer: The phrase “compounds are on top of each other” refers to overlapping chromatographic spots or peaks, which occurs when compounds have similar polarities causing co-elution.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_39
proposed answer: The phrase “compounds are on top of each other” refers to overlapping chromatographic spots (identical Rf or retention times) due to similar polarities, which aligns with choice 2.
