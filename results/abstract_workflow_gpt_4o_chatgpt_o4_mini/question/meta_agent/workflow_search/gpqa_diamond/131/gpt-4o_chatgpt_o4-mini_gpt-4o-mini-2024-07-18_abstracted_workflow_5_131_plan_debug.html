    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.&#39;, choice1=&#39;1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, choice2=&#39;1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, choice3=&#39;1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene&#39;, choice4=&#39;1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Assess which pair of compounds from the options provided can collectively account for both the 6.7 ppm and 2.2 ppm signals as observed. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent aUmb:
Subtasks 5 and 6 demonstrate that 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one aromatic singlet and a 6H methyl singlet, while 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one aromatic singlet and two 3H methyl singlets, matching the observed 1:1 aromatic signals and 2:1:1 methyl signals.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent aUmb:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Select the correct pair of compounds from the given choices that match the observed NMR data.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
