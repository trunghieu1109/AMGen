This indicates one component has a pair of equivalent methyls (accounting for the 2×3\u2009H signal) and the other has three distinct methyls (each 3\u2009H). Combined with the two aromatic environments each giving a singlet, this matches a 1:1 mixture of a symmetric tetramethylbenzene (1,2,4,5-) and an unsymmetric tetramethylbenzene (1,2,3,5-).; answer: The two singlets at 6.7\u2009ppm correspond to two aromatic CH environments (1\u2009H each), and the three singlets at 2.2\u2009ppm (2:1:1) arise from one set of equivalent methyls (2×3\u2009H) and two unique methyls (3\u2009H each), consistent with a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\nCoT agent 8Ctc, determining expected NMR signals, thinking: To predict 1H NMR signals we consider each molecule’s symmetry and count unique proton environments (aromatic H, Me, Et). Chemical shifts are approximate.; answer: 1) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (C2v):\n   • Ar–H: one singlet ~6.7 ppm, 2H\n   • Me (positions 1&5): singlet ~2.30 ppm, 6H\n   • Me (positions 2&4): singlet ~2.25 ppm, 6H\n\n2) 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Cs):\n   • Ar–H at C4: singlet ~6.80 ppm, 1H\n   • Ar–H at C6: singlet ~6.75 ppm, 1H\n   • Me (positions 1&5): singlet ~2.35 ppm, 6H\n   • Me (position 2): singlet ~2.30 ppm, 3H\n   • Me (position 3): singlet ~2.25 ppm, 3H\n\n3) 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (C2):\n   • Ar–H: one singlet ~6.9 ppm, 2H\n   • Me (positions 1&4): singlet ~2.35 ppm, 6H\n   • Me (positions 2&3): singlet ~2.30 ppm, 6H\n\n4) 1,4-Diethylbenzene (D2h):\n   • Ar–H (2&6): singlet ~7.10 ppm, 2H\n   • Ar–H (3&5): singlet ~7.05 ppm, 2H\n   • CH2 (Et): quartet ~2.75 ppm, 4H (J≈7.6 Hz)\n   • CH3 (Et): triplet ~1.25 ppm, 6H (J≈7.6 Hz)\nCoT agent 8OaW, comparing expected and observed NMR signals, thinking: The observed two aromatic singlets (1H each) and three methyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio match only the combination of a symmetric tetramethylbenzene (two equivalent methyls giving the 2×3H signal) and an unsymmetric tetramethylbenzene (two unique 3H methyls). None of the other candidates reproduce both the number of aromatic singlets and the 2:1:1 methyl integration.; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nCoT agent oXlA, identifying compounds for 6.7 ppm signals, thinking: Only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene each give a single aromatic singlet (2H) due to their C2 symmetry; their mixture yields two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nCoT agent eupw, identifying compounds for 2.2 ppm signals, thinking: The three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio arise from one compound with two equivalent methyl groups (6H, giving the ‘2’ integration) and another with two distinct methyl groups (3H each, giving the two ‘1’s). Among the candidates, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides the 6H singlet and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides the two 3H singlets.; answer: A)\nCoT agent aUmb, assessing compound pairs, thinking: Subtasks 5 and 6 demonstrate that 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one aromatic singlet and a 6H methyl singlet, while 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one aromatic singlet and two 3H methyl singlets, matching the observed 1:1 aromatic signals and 2:1:1 methyl signals.; answer: A)\nCoT agent 6XEG, selecting correct compound pair, thinking: Sub-task 7 identified that the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for the two aromatic singlets and three methyl singlets in the observed ratios.
