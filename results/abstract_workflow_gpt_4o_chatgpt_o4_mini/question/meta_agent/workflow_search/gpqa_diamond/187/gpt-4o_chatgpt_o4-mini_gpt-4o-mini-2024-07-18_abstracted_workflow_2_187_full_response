The general result expresses d_{hkl} in terms of a and α and Miller indices.; answer: d_{hkl} = a·√(1 − 3\u2009cos²α + 2\u2009cos³α)\u2009/\u2009√[ (h² + k² + l²)(1 − cosα) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα − cos²α) ]\nCoT-SC agent wYJm, substituting parameters, thinking: We substitute a=10\u2009Å, α=30°, cos\u2009α=√3/2, and h=k=l=1 into the formula from sub-task 1: d_{hkl}=a·√(1−3\u2009cos²α+2\u2009cos³α)/√[(h²+k²+l²)(1−cosα)+2(hk+kl+lh)(cosα−cos²α)].; answer: d_{111} = 10·√(1−3·(√3/2)²+2·(√3/2)³) / √[3·(1−√3/2)+6·(√3/2−(√3/2)²)] ≈ 2.11\u2009Å\nCoT-SC agent 0r0k, substituting parameters, thinking: We directly replace a with 10 Å, α with 30°, and h=k=l=1 in the general rhombohedral dₕₖₗ formula.; answer: d_{111} = 10 * sqrt(1 - 3*cos^2(30°) + 2*cos^3(30°)) / sqrt(3*(1 - cos(30°)) + 6*(cos(30°) - cos^2(30°)))\nCoT-SC agent sjpE, substituting parameters, thinking: We take the general rhombohedral dₕₖₗ formula and set a=10\u2009Å, α=30°, h=k=l=1, then substitute cos30°=√3/2.; answer: d₁₁₁ = 10·√(1 − 3\u2009cos²30° + 2\u2009cos³30°) / √[3(1 − cos30°) + 6(cos30° − cos²30°)] ≃ 2.11\u2009Å\nReflexion CoT agent 6XJ7, calculating interplanar distance, thinking: Substitute a=10\u2009Å, α=30° (cosα=√3/2≈0.8660) and h=k=l=1 into\nd_{111}=10·√(1−3·0.75+2·0.6495)/√[3·(1−0.8660)+6·(0.8660−0.75)]\nNumerator=10·√(1−2.25+1.299)=10·√0.049≈10·0.221=2.21\u2009Å\nDenominator=√(0.402+0.696)=√1.098≈1.048\nd_{111}=2.21/1.048≈2.11\u2009Å; answer: 2.11 Å\nCritic agent bbec, providing feedback, thinking: The submitted work has two key errors in applying the rhombohedral interplanar‐spacing formula.  First, the denominator for d_{hkl} should be √[h²+k²+l²+2(hk+kl+hl)·cos\u2009α] = √(3+6·0.8660)≈2.863, not the √1.098≈1.048 used.  Second, carrying out the correct substitution gives d_{111}=10·√(1−3·0.75+2·0.6495)/2.863≈10·0.221/2.863≈0.773\u2009Å, which is still inconsistent with the multiple‐choice context.
