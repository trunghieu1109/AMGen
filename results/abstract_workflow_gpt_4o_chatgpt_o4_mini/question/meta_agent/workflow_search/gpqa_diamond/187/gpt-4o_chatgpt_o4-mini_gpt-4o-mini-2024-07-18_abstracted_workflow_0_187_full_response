No additional data is missing, so a direct characterization is possible.; answer: A rhombohedral crystal has a = b = c with α = β = γ ≠ 90°, forming a primitive cell that is a skewed cube (a rhombohedron). The (111) plane intersects each axis at one lattice constant, making it one of the lowest-index planes with high atomic packing density and symmetry. It often gives strong diffraction peaks and represents a densely packed atomic layer in the rhombohedral structure.\nCoT agent pvO7, selecting formula, thinking: For a rhombohedral lattice (a = b = c, α = β = γ), the general triclinic interplanar spacing formula simplifies by setting equal parameters. The denominator involves the metric determinant (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α), and the numerator includes h²+k²+l²+2(hk+hl+kl)cosα. This yields the correct d_hkl expression.; answer: d_hkl = a * sqrt[(1 - 3 cos^2α + 2 cos^3α) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα)]\nCoT agent R3D0, applying formula, thinking: We apply the formula d_hkl = a * sqrt[(1 - 3 cos^2α + 2 cos^3α) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk+hl+kl) cosα)] with a = 10 Å, α = 30°, h = k = l = 1. cos 30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, so numerator = 1 - 3·0.75 + 2·0.6495 ≈ 0.0490; denominator = 3 + 2·3·0.8660 ≈ 8.1962. The ratio ≈ 0.00598, its square root ≈ 0.0773, times 10 Å gives d_111 ≈ 0.773 Å.; answer: 0.773 Angstrom\nDebate agent WiMk, round 0, comparing results, thinking: The calculated d_111 ≈0.773 Å does not match any of the provided choices (all around 9–10 Å).; answer: [ERROR]\nDebate agent Q6ih, round 0, comparing results, thinking: The provided choices are around 9–10 Å, but the calculated result (~0.773 Å) clearly does not match any.
