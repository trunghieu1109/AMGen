The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151223\u2009u. Subtracting 3 electron masses (3×0.00054858\u2009u) gives a nuclear mass of 6.0134766\u2009u. Converting to energy units: 6.0134766\u2009u×931.494\u2009MeV/u ≃ 5603.64\u2009MeV, i.e. about 5.6036\u2009GeV.; answer: 5.6036 GeV/c^2\nCoT-SC agent Fv1T, determining relativistic mass, thinking: To find the relativistic mass m_rel = γ m0. For v=0.96c, γ = 1/√(1−0.96²) = 1/√(1−0.9216) = 1/√0.0784 = 3.5714.

From sub-task 2 we have γ ≃ 3.5714 and m₀ c² ≃ 5.6036 GeV, so E ≃ 3.5714×5.6036 GeV ≃ 20.01 GeV.; answer: 20.01 GeV\nCritic agent uWhN, providing feedback, thinking: Your approach of using E = γ m₀c² with γ ≃ 3.5714 is correct. However, the rest‐mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus should be taken more precisely (m₀c² ≃ 5.6015 GeV using 3p+3n minus binding energy), which yields E ≃ 3.5714 × 5.6015 GeV = 20.1320 GeV to 1e-4 precision.
