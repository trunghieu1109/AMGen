    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.&#39;, choice1=&#39;2-styrylepoxide&#39;, choice2=&#39;2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane&#39;, choice3=&#39;2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane&#39;, choice4=&#39;2-methyl-3-styryloxirane&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Select the compound choice that best matches the NMR data and the identified structural features of the resulting product. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent r0OB:
The NMR data indicate a para‐substituted phenyl ring (two aromatic doublets) and two distinct methyl singlets. Among the choices, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (choice B) provides the para‐methyl aromatic pattern and matches the observed signals most closely.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ys2b:
The NMR data show a para-methyl substituted phenyl ring (two aromatic doublets) and two distinct methyl singlets. Among the options, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane fits the para pattern and methyl signals best.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Xwlu:
The 1H-NMR shows two aromatic doublets (para substitution) and two distinct methyl singlets. Among the options only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (choice B) provides a para-methyl phenyl pattern and two Me groups, making it the best match.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent wIAV:
The NMR data show a para-substituted aromatic ring (two aromatic doublets) and two distinct methyl singlets. Only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (choice B) matches this pattern most closely.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent r0OB:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent ys2b:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Xwlu:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the best matching compound.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
