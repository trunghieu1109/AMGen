    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &amp;  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV &amp; 105.7 MeV respectively.&#39;, choice1=&#39;2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV&#39;, choice2=&#39;7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV&#39;, choice3=&#39;3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV&#39;, choice4=&#39;4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Apply conservation of energy to find the total energy of the decay products (mu(+) and nu). The total energy of the decay products must equal the rest mass energy of the Pi(+). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9bZF:
By conservation of energy, the sum of the total energies of the mu+ and the neutrino must equal the initial total energy of the stationary pion, which is its rest mass energy of 139.6 MeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9bZF:
139.6 MeV

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the kinetic energy of mu(+) using its total energy (from subtask 4) and its rest mass energy (105.7 MeV). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent DvAC:
To find the muon’s kinetic energy, we first need its total energy in the pion’s rest frame from two-body decay kinematics: E_μ = (m_π^2 + m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≃ 109.82 MeV. Subtracting its rest mass (105.7 MeV) gives KE_μ ≃ 4.12 MeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent DvAC:
4.12 MeV

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) using the remaining energy after accounting for the mu(+) energy.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The pion’s rest energy 139.6 MeV is split into the muon’s total energy (≈109.82 MeV) and the neutrino’s energy (all kinetic). KE_ν = 139.6 MeV − 109.82 MeV ≃ 29.8 MeV.
