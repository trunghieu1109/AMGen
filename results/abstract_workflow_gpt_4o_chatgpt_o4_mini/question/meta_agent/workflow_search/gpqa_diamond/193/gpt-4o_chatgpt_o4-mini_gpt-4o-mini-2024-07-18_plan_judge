Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_193
proposed answer: There are two configurations with energy -3J giving Boltzmann factor e^{3Jβ} each, and six configurations with energy +J giving e^{-Jβ} each. Summing yields Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_193
proposed answer: There are 2 configurations with Boltzmann factor e^{3Jβ} and 6 with e^{−Jβ}, so Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}, matching choice1.
