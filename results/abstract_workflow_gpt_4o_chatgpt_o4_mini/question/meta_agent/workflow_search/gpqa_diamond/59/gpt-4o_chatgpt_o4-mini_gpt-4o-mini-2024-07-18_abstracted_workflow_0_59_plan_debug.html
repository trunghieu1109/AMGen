    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?&#39;, choice1=&#39;72 years&#39;, choice2=&#39;The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;77 years&#39;, choice4=&#39;81 years&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on whether the astronaut reaches Earth before dying. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent o8Cz:
The proper travel time (~81 years) is less than the average lifespan (150 years), so the astronaut will reach Earth before dying. There is no provided multiple-choice letter, so we must return [ERROR].

### answer by Final Decision Agent o8Cz:
[ERROR]

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Select the correct answer choice based on the calculated travel time and the comparison with the aliens lifetime.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The proper time for the journey at v = 0.99999987c over ~160,000 ly is τ = d γ^{-1}/c ≃ 160,000 ly·√(1–β²) ≃ 160,000·0.00051 ≃ 81.6 years, which is below the 150-year lifespan, so the astronaut arrives. The matching choice is 81 years.
