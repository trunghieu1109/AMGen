Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_59
proposed answer: The proper time for the journey at v = 0.99999987c over ~160,000 ly is τ = d γ^{-1}/c ≃ 160,000 ly·√(1–β²) ≃ 160,000·0.00051 ≃ 81.6 years, which is below the 150-year lifespan, so the astronaut arrives. The matching choice is 81 years.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_59
proposed answer: The proper travel time (~81.6 years) is less than the astronaut’s 150-year lifespan, and among the given options, 81 years (D) is the closest.
