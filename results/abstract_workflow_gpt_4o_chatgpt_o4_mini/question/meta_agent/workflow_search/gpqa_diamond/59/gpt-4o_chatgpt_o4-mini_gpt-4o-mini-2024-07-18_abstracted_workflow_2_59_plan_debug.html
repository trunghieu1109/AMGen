Example(question=&#39;An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?&#39;, choice1=&#39;72 years&#39;, choice2=&#39;The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;77 years&#39;, choice4=&#39;81 years&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Select the correct answer choice based on the calculated time and the astronauts lifespan. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent uG4g:
The calculated proper travel time (~81.6 years) is less than the astronaut’s 150-year lifespan, so they will complete the journey. Among the options, 81 years (D) is the closest.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Ml5Y:
The proper travel time (~81.6 years) is less than the astronaut’s 150-year lifespan, so the closest choice is 81 years.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent z7dL:
The proper travel time (~81.6 years) is less than the astronaut’s 150-year lifespan, so they will complete the journey in their lifetime. Among the choices, 81 years (D) is the closest.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent vX9s:
The proper travel time (~81.6 years) is less than the astronaut’s 150-year lifespan, so the closest answer choice is 81 years.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct answer choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
