It’s straightforward: they are the Pauli matrices times ħ/2.; answer: P_x = (ħ/2)·[[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nP_y = (ħ/2)·[[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nP_z = (ħ/2)·[[1, 0], [0, -1]]\nCoT agent LDoc, understanding eigenvalue, thinking: We need to explain the role of the eigenvalue +ħ/2 in the eigenvalue equation for a spin-½ operator: it labels the spin-up state along direction n and fixes the eigenvector equation. This is not a multiple-choice query, so we give the conceptual explanation.; answer: The value +ħ/2 is the eigenvalue of the spin‐projection operator P·n for a spin‐½ particle. It signifies that the state is the “spin‐up” eigenstate along the chosen direction n. In the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ⟩ = (+ħ/2)|ψ⟩, this eigenvalue determines that the vector |ψ⟩ is an eigenvector with spin aligned parallel to n, and it fixes the relative amplitudes (up to a phase) in the normalized spinor solution.\nCoT-SC agent F5vM, formulating operator, thinking: To form the spin operator along an arbitrary unit vector n, we take the linear combination of its Cartesian components with the corresponding direction cosines. Since n lies in the x–z plane, n=(n_x,0,n_z), often parameterized as (sinθ,0,cosθ).; answer: P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).  In the x–z plane (n_y=0), P_n = (ħ/2)(sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z).\nCoT-SC agent VNUm, formulating operator, thinking: To project P along n in the x–z plane, we take the linear combination of P_x and P_z with coefficients n_x and n_z.; answer: P_n = \n n_x P_x + n_z P_z \n= \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\bigl(n_x\\sigma_x + n_z\\sigma_z\\bigr)\n= \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}n_z & n_x\\\\ n_x & -n_z\\end{pmatrix}\nCoT-SC agent 7kKs, formulating operator, thinking: We project the operator onto the direction n in the x–z plane by taking the dot product: P_n = n·P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Using the given matrices this yields (ħ/2)(n_xσ_x + n_zσ_z).; answer: P_n = n·P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (ħ/2)(n_xσ_x + n_zσ_z)\nReflexion CoT agent zbiy, setting up eigenvalue equation, thinking: We form the eigenvalue equation by substituting P_n from subtask 3 into (P·n)ψ = (+ħ/2)ψ and canceling the common factor ħ/2. Then express in Pauli‐matrix form and component form.; answer: Eigenvalue equation:\n(ħ/2)(sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z)\u2009ψ = (ħ/2)\u2009ψ\n⇒ (sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z)\u2009ψ = ψ\nIn matrix form:\n[ [cosθ,\u2009sinθ]; [sinθ,\u2009−cosθ] ] [ψ₁;\u2009ψ₂] = [ψ₁;\u2009ψ₂]\nCritic agent 2J45, providing feedback, thinking: The eigenvalue equation (ħ/2)(sinθ σₓ + cosθ σ_z) ψ = (ħ/2) ψ ⇒ (sinθ σₓ + cosθ σ_z) ψ = ψ is algebraically correct for a spin‐½ pointing in the x–z plane (φ=0). In matrix form [ [cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, –cosθ] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = [ψ₁; ψ₂] reproduces the two coupled equations for ψ₁,ψ₂. However, this setup has the following limitations:\n1. It assumes φ=0 (no y‐component), so it cannot describe an arbitrary direction in 3D.  \n2. It omits the overall phase or complex phase e^{iφ}, which is essential for a general spinor solution.  \n3. It does not enforce normalization or fix the global phase of the eigenvector.\n4. It treats the Pauli matrices in a purely real basis, which hides possible complex structure for general φ.; answer: To handle an arbitrary direction n=(sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), one must solve (σ·n)ψ=+ψ with\nσ·n = sinθ\u2009cosφ\u2009σₓ + sinθ\u2009sinφ\u2009σ_y + cosθ\u2009σ_z.\nThis yields the normalized eigenvector\nψ_+ = (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ}\u2009sin(θ/2))^T,\nwhich reduces to the x–z‐plane form when φ=0.\nReflexion CoT agent zbiy, refining eigenvalue equation setup, thinking: We substitute P_n from subtask 3 into the eigenvalue equation and cancel the common factor ħ/2, yielding the matrix equation for ψ in the x–z plane.; answer: (ħ/2)(sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z)\u2009ψ = (ħ/2)\u2009ψ  ⇒  (sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z)\u2009ψ = ψ  \nin matrix form:\n[ [cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, −cosθ] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = [ψ₁; ψ₂]\nCritic agent 2J45, providing feedback, thinking: The equation (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) ψ = ψ correctly results from dividing P·n ψ = (ħ/2) ψ by ħ/2. In matrix form [[cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, −cosθ]] ψ = ψ is valid. However it assumes φ = 0 (spin axis confined to the x–z plane), ignores azimuthal dependence (no σ_y term), neglects overall phase freedom, and only addresses the +1 eigenvalue case. It also presumes θ in [0, π].; answer: The fully general eigenvalue equation for a direction n(θ,φ) is (sinθ cosφ σ_x + sinθ sinφ σ_y + cosθ σ_z) ψ = +ψ. For φ=0 this reduces to (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) ψ = ψ. The normalized eigenvector is ψ = (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to a global phase.\nReflexion CoT agent zbiy, refining eigenvalue equation setup, thinking: We form P_n from subtask 3 as (ħ/2)(sin θ\u2009σ_x + cos θ\u2009σ_z). Substituting into (P·n)ψ = (ħ/2)ψ and canceling ħ/2 yields (sin θ\u2009σ_x + cos θ\u2009σ_z)ψ = ψ. Converting to matrix form gives the explicit coupled equations for ψ₁ and ψ₂.; answer: (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) ψ = (ħ/2) ψ ⇒ (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) ψ = ψ\nIn matrix form:\n[ [cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, −cosθ] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = [ψ₁; ψ₂]\nCritic agent 2J45, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation correctly forms P·n by projecting onto the x–z plane (φ=0) and cancels the common ħ/2 factor, yielding (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z)ψ = ψ. Casting this into matrix form as [[cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, –cosθ]]·(ψ₁,ψ₂)^T = (ψ₁,ψ₂)^T is algebraically consistent.; answer: Limitation: the setup assumes the azimuthal angle φ=0 (n in x–z plane) and omits any σ_y component. For a general direction n(θ,φ) one must use P·n = (ħ/2)(sinθ cosφ σ_x + sinθ sinφ σ_y + cosθ σ_z), leading to (sinθ cosφ σ_x + sinθ sinφ σ_y + cosθ σ_z)ψ = ψ. Without φ=0 the original 2×2 matrix changes and must include off-diagonal imaginary entries from σ_y.\nReflexion CoT agent zbiy, refining eigenvalue equation setup, thinking: To set up the eigenvalue equation, we take P·n = (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) from subtask 3 and substitute into (P·n)ψ = (ħ/2)ψ.
