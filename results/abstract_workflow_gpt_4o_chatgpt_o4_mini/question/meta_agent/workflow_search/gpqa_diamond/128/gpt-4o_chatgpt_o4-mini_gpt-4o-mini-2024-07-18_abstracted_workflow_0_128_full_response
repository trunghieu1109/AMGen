Catalytic hydrogenation reduces the –CN to –CH2NH2 without affecting the –OH, giving an aminomethyl substituent at C1 alongside the existing hydroxyl. Thus compound C is 1-(aminomethyl)-2,3-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol.; answer: 1-(Aminomethyl)-2,3-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol\nCoT agent T6mh, analyzing reaction C + HNO2, thinking: The primary aminomethyl substituent on C1 will be diazotized by HNO2 and replaced by a hydroxymethyl group, giving a diol at C1.; answer: 1-(hydroxymethyl)-2,3-dimethylcyclopentane-1-ol\nCoT agent lede, analyzing elimination from D, thinking: Compound D is the geminal diol at C1 that, upon elimination of water (an “inert gas” in this context), regenerates the ketone at that position. The ring bears methyl groups at C2, C3, and C4, matching 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one.; answer: B)\nCoT agent aNhI, evaluating IR spectrum of A, thinking: The IR absorption around 1750 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a non-conjugated C=O stretch (ketone). There are no broad O–H or N–H bands, so compound A must contain a simple cyclic ketone functional group rather than an alcohol, acid, or amide.; answer: The strong peak at ~1750 cm⁻¹ indicates an unconjugated ketone (C=O) functionality in compound A.\nCoT agent OhUQ, evaluating IR spectrum of E, thinking: The IR absorption around 1715 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O stretch in a saturated ketone. This matches the cyclopentanone core of 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one identified as compound E.; answer: The strong peak at 1715 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone C=O, consistent with 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one.\nCoT agent H69T, analyzing reaction A + ylide, thinking: The Wittig reaction with the unknown ylide installs the isopropylidene group at the former carbonyl.
