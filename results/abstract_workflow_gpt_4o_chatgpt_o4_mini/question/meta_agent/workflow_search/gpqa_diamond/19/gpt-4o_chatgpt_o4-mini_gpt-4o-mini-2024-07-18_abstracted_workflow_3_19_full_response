If the interaction current only couples to individual nucleons and not to two- or many-body currents, this directly supports treating the nucleon as an isolated target. Hence this assumption is in line with the impulse approximation.; answer: Yes\nCoT agent ZF6h, thinking: The impulse approximation assumes the struck nucleon interacts independently, so requiring the nucleus be transparent except for that nucleon ensures there are no additional nuclear interactions (final-state interactions) that would violate this independence. Thus this assumption directly supports the impulse approximation.; answer: Yes, it supports the impulse approximation.\nCoT agent lqD4, thinking: The impulse approximation assumes the probe interacts with a single nucleon behaving as if free, which requires assumptions about the interaction current (1), nuclear transparency (2), and neglect of binding forces (4). Whether quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic (3) pertains to internal nucleon structure models, not to the impulse approximation at the nucleon level. Thus assumption 3 is not required to justify the impulse approximation.; answer: No, the non-relativistic quark assumption does not support the impulse approximation.\nCoT agent NtiV, thinking: Assuming the nucleon experiences no binding forces means it behaves as if it were free during the interaction, which is precisely the essence of the impulse approximation.; answer: Yes, it supports the impulse approximation\nCoT-SC agent zTc7, thinking: Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 together ensure that the probe interacts only with a single nucleon, that there are no final-state interactions with the rest of the nucleus, and that the struck nucleon behaves as if it were free. These are precisely the conditions defining the impulse approximation.; answer: Yes\nCoT-SC agent LkIf, thinking: Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 together ensure that the probe interacts only with a single nucleon, that no other nuclear interactions distort the reaction, and that the nucleon behaves as if unbound—precisely the conditions for the impulse approximation.; answer: Yes\nCoT-SC agent FQAt, thinking: Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 state that the interaction hits only a single nucleon, the rest of the nucleus is transparent, and that nucleon feels no binding forces. Together, these ensure the nucleon behaves as if free during the probe, which is exactly the impulse approximation.; answer: Yes\nCoT-SC agent l9GA, thinking: Assumptions 1 and 4 are necessary for the impulse approximation, but assumption 3 is irrelevant to treating the nucleon as free. Crucially, assumption 2 (nuclear transparency) is missing, so the set {1,3,4} fails to guarantee the nucleus behaves transparently. Hence they do not jointly imply the impulse approximation.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent SxcB, thinking: Assumptions 1 and 4 support treating the nucleon as free in the interaction, but omitting assumption 2 (nuclear transparency) means one cannot neglect final‐state interactions with the rest of the nucleus. Including assumption 3 (non‐relativistic quarks) is irrelevant to the impulse approximation. Thus 1, 3, 4 together do not suffice.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent rOGZ, thinking: Assumptions 1 and 4 cover single-nucleon interaction and neglect of binding, but without assumption 2 (nuclear transparency) the probe could still interact with or be affected by the rest of the nucleus. Assumption 3 on quark relativity is irrelevant. Therefore 1, 3, and 4 alone do not suffice for the impulse approximation.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent H6yg, thinking: The impulse approximation requires that the probe couples only to a single nucleon (assumption 1) in addition to nuclear transparency (2) and no binding forces (4). Omitting assumption 1 means multi-nucleon currents could contribute, so 2,3,4 alone do not guarantee the impulse approximation.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent gSth, thinking: Assumptions 2 (nuclear transparency), 3 (non-relativistic quarks), and 4 (no binding forces) cover final-state interactions, internal structure, and free behavior, but they omit assumption 1 that the interaction current only couples to individual nucleons. Without that, other currents (meson exchange, two-body currents) could contribute, so 2,3,4 alone do not suffice for the impulse approximation.; answer: No, the set {2,3,4} is insufficient to imply the impulse approximation without assumption 1.\nCoT-SC agent W3gM, thinking: While assumptions 2 and 4 support the impulse approximation, assumption 3 is irrelevant and assumption 1 (that the interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons) is missing. Thus 2, 3, and 4 alone do not jointly imply the impulse approximation.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent TYlY, thinking: Assumptions 1 and 2 ensure the probe only hits one nucleon and there are no final-state interactions, while assumption 3 concerns the internal structure of the nucleon. However, the key requirement that the nucleon behaves as if unbound (assumption 4) is missing. Therefore 1, 2, and 3 alone do not imply the impulse approximation.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent 6LIc, thinking: Assumptions 1 and 2 ensure the probe interacts only with a single nucleon and there are no other nuclear interactions, but assumption 3 (non-relativistic quarks) does not address neglect of binding forces. The missing assumption 4 is required to treat the nucleon as free, so 1,2,3 alone do not imply the impulse approximation.; answer: No\nCoT-SC agent zC7B, thinking: Assumptions 1 and 2 address single‐nucleon coupling and nuclear transparency, but without assumption 4 (neglecting binding forces) the struck nucleon still feels the nucleus. Adding assumption 3 (nonrelativistic quarks) does not remove binding effects.
