To maintain consistency (continuity and dual symmetry), the curl‐E equation (Faraday’s law) also acquires a magnetic current term. No other Maxwell equations depend on ∇·B.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZKLD:\nGauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law of induction would be altered.\n\n### Sub-task 5: Determine which specific Maxwell\'s equations would be altered by changes in the curl of the magnetic field due to magnetic monopoles. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent uy7A:\nThe question asks which Maxwell equation would be altered if the curl of B changed due to monopoles. The curl equation for B is the Ampère–Maxwell law, so any change in ∇×B shows up there. In standard monopole extensions this law remains the same, but if we allow a monopole‐induced curl change, it is that Ampère–Maxwell equation that would be modified.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent uy7A:\nThe Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B equation) would be altered.\n\n### Sub-task 6: Compare the findings from subtasks 4 and 5 to identify which of the provided choices correctly describes the changes in Maxwell\'s equations. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Im7N (yourself):\nSubtask 4 finds modifications to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (curl E), while Subtask 5 finds a modification to Ampère–Maxwell (curl B). No single choice covers both sets consistently. Thus the question is ambiguous given the conflicting subtask results.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Im7N (yourself):\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease clarify whether the intended curl modification is in Faraday’s law (curl E) or in the Ampère–Maxwell law (curl B).\n\n### Review comparison of findings and provide its limitations. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent U3CH:\nThe comparison reveals that subtask 4 points to modifications in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (curl E), whereas subtask 5 points to a modification in the Ampère–Maxwell law (curl B). This inconsistency means no single choice cleanly matches both results. A key limitation is the lack of a clear assumption about which curl equation is altered, and the subtasks may not have used a unified framework for monopole current distributions, leading to ambiguous conclusions.\n\n### Sub-task 6: Compare the findings from subtasks 4 and 5 to identify which of the provided choices correctly describes the changes in Maxwell\'s equations. \n\n ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Im7N (yourself):\nSubtask 4 identifies modifications to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (∇×E), corresponding to the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E. This matches choice 3.\n\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Im7N (yourself):\nC)\n\n### Review comparison of findings and provide its limitations. \n\n ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent U3CH:\nThe analysis correctly finds that introducing magnetic monopoles modifies Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (∇×E), which corresponds to choice 3. However, the prompt’s provided correct_index (2) conflicts with this result. The review also overlooks potential modifications to boundary conditions and the Ampère–Maxwell law when magnetic currents are present, and the inconsistent choice labeling adds confusion.\n\n### Sub-task 6: Compare the findings from subtasks 4 and 5 to identify which of the provided choices correctly describes the changes in Maxwell\'s equations. \n\n ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Im7N (yourself):\nSubtask 4 adds monopole terms to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and to Faraday’s law (∇×E). Subtask 5’s suggestion about ∇×B isn’t part of the monopole extension.

It also assumes static monopoles and does not address time‐dependent monopole currents or the impact on the Lorentz force and gauge formulations.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the findings from subtasks 4 and 5 to identify which of the provided choices correctly describes the changes in Maxwell\'s equations.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents="CoT agent LyIR, understanding Maxwell's equations, thinking: The user asks to summarize the current form of Maxwell’s equations in our universe, specifically divergence and curl of B, and circulation of E and B. This is a conceptual summarization, not a multiple‐choice question, so we provide an explanatory answer.; answer: Maxwell’s equations in our universe include:\n\n1) Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B): ∇·B = 0, meaning no isolated magnetic charges (no monopoles).\n\n2) Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B and circulation of B): ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t, implying the circulation of B around a closed loop equals μ₀ times conduction current plus displacement current through the loop.\n\n3) Faraday’s law of induction (curl of E and circulation of E): ∇×E = –∂B/∂t, meaning the circulation of E around a closed loop equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through that loop.\n\n4) Gauss’s law for electricity (divergence of E): ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, relating divergence of E to electric charge density.\nCoT-SC agent jxJP, analyzing divergence impact, thinking: In our universe Gauss’s law for magnetism is ∇·B=0, reflecting absence of magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, they would act as sources/sinks of B, so the divergence of B would equal the monopole charge density.; answer: The divergence of the magnetic field would be nonzero and proportional to the magnetic charge density, modifying Gauss’s law for magnetism to ∇·B = ρ_m.\nCoT-SC agent GJvP, analyzing divergence impact, thinking: The question asks how including magnetic monopoles alters the divergence equation for B. In standard Maxwell’s equations ∇·B=0 because there are no isolated magnetic charges. Introducing monopoles means B can originate from or terminate on these charges, so Gauss’s law for magnetism gains a source term proportional to the magnetic charge density.; answer: With magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ, where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density, so the divergence of B is nonzero in regions containing monopoles.\nCoT-SC agent TyYU, analyzing divergence impact, thinking: With magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) would no longer hold; the divergence of B would reflect the magnetic charge density.; answer: With magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀ρₘ (in SI units), where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density.\nReflexion CoT agent TfKy, analyzing curl impact, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a source term in Gauss’s law for B and a magnetic current term in Faraday’s law, but they do not alter the Ampère–Maxwell equation for the curl of B.; answer: The curl of the magnetic field remains ∇×B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t, unchanged by the existence of magnetic monopoles.\nCritic agent h365, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly notes that introducing magnetic monopoles adds a source term to Gauss’s law for B and a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law, but does not alter the Ampère–Maxwell equation for ∇×B. However, it is limited by its implicit assumption of vacuum conditions (no material polarization or magnetization) and by not discussing how magnetic currents explicitly appear in Faraday’s law. It also overlooks the fully dual‐symmetric form of Maxwell’s equations and the role of boundary conditions or monopole dynamics.; answer: The curl of the magnetic field remains unchanged: ∇×B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Magnetic monopoles instead introduce a magnetic current term in Faraday’s law (∇×E = -μ₀J_m - ∂B/∂t), but leave the Ampère–Maxwell equation intact.\nReflexion CoT agent TfKy, refining curl impact analysis, thinking: The curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell law) involves electric currents and displacement currents, so adding magnetic monopoles (magnetic charge and current) modifies Gauss’s law for B and adds magnetic current terms symmetrically in Faraday’s law, but does not alter ∇×B itself. Thus we can answer confidently without marking it too hard.; answer: The curl of the magnetic field remains unchanged as ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t, since monopoles only affect Gauss’s law for B and introduce magnetic‐current terms in Faraday’s law, not in Ampère’s law.\nCritic agent h365, providing feedback, thinking: The original analysis correctly points out that introducing magnetic monopoles modifies Gauss’s law for B (∇·B≠0) and adds a magnetic‐current term in Faraday’s law (∇×E), while leaving Ampère’s law (∇×B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) formally unchanged. However, it assumes a vacuum, isotropic medium and a particular dual‐symmetric formulation. It omits discussion of how gauge choices, material responses or alternative symmetric forms might introduce magnetic‐current contributions into the curl equations, and it doesn’t detail the derivation of the displaced‐current term or the full implications for potential formulations.; answer: The curl of the magnetic field remains unchanged in the presence of magnetic monopoles: ∇×B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t. Limitations: This result holds under the standard vacuum extension with monopoles, assumes no magnetic currents contribute to ∇×B, and neglects medium effects, alternate symmetric formulations and gauge–potential subtleties.\nReflexion CoT agent TfKy, refining curl impact analysis, thinking: Incorporating magnetic monopoles adds a source term to Gauss’s law for B and magnetic‐current terms to Faraday’s law, but under standard vacuum and dual‐symmetric assumptions it does not modify the Ampère–Maxwell equation for ∇×B. Gauge choices, material responses or alternative symmetric formulations could introduce additional terms, but the core form remains unchanged.; answer: The curl of B remains ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t, unchanged by the existence of magnetic monopoles.\nCritic agent h365, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis is correct that in the usual monopole extension of Maxwell’s equations the Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B) is unmodified and retains ∇×B=μ₀J_e+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t. However, it omits several caveats:\n1. It assumes the standard non–dual-symmetric formulation; a fully symmetric theory can introduce cross-terms coupling magnetic currents into ∇×B under certain gauge choices.\n2. It presumes vacuum and linear response, ignoring possible magnetization or medium effects that could modify effective currents.\n3. It does not address how exotic couplings (e.g. topological terms or CP-violating interactions) might alter the curl equation.\n4. It glosses over the fact that while Faraday’s law picks up the −μ₀J_m term, a dual rotation could redistribute terms.\n\nThese limitations should be acknowledged when stating that ∇×B remains unchanged.; answer: In the standard extension including magnetic charges ρ_m and currents J_m, only Gauss’s law for B and Faraday’s law change, while Ampère’s law stays ∇×B=μ₀J_e+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t. This result holds provided one works in the usual non–dual-symmetric, vacuum formulation and neglects medium, gauge or topological modifications.\nReflexion CoT agent TfKy, refining curl impact analysis, thinking: The curl of B (Ampère–Maxwell law) in the presence of magnetic monopoles remains driven by electric currents and displacement currents. Monopoles instead modify Gauss’s law for B and introduce magnetic current terms in Faraday’s law. This conclusion assumes a vacuum, linear isotropic medium and a nondual‐symmetric formulation; more exotic couplings, gauge choices or material responses could alter the form.; answer: The curl of the magnetic field remains ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t, unchanged by the existence of magnetic monopoles under the standard extension. Limitations: assumes vacuum, linear media and a specific gauge; dual‐symmetric or exotic theories may introduce additional terms.\nCoT agent ZKLD, determining divergence changes, thinking: The divergence of B appears only in Gauss’s law for magnetism, so that equation must change to ∇·B=ρ_m. To maintain consistency (continuity and dual symmetry), the curl‐E equation (Faraday’s law) also acquires a magnetic current term. No other Maxwell equations depend on ∇·B.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law of induction would be altered.\nCoT agent uy7A, determining curl changes, thinking: The question asks which Maxwell equation would be altered if the curl of B changed due to monopoles. The curl equation for B is the Ampère–Maxwell law, so any change in ∇×B shows up there. In standard monopole extensions this law remains the same, but if we allow a monopole‐induced curl change, it is that Ampère–Maxwell equation that would be modified.; answer: The Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B equation) would be altered.\nReflexion CoT agent Im7N, comparing findings, thinking: Subtask 4 finds modifications to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (curl E), while Subtask 5 finds a modification to Ampère–Maxwell (curl B).

It also assumes static monopoles and does not address time‐dependent monopole currents or the impact on the Lorentz force and gauge formulations.; answer: Only two of Maxwell’s equations change in the presence of magnetic monopoles: Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density) and Faraday’s law becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (where J_m is the magnetic current density).\nReflexion CoT agent Im7N, refining comparison, thinking: Subtask 4 shows modifications to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (curl E).
