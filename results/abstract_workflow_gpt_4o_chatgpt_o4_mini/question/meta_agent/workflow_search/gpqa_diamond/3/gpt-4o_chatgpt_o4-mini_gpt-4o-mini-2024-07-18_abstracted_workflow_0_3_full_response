There’s sufficient information to describe how field equations change and how field lines behave without needing further details.; answer: Magnetic monopoles act as point sources or sinks of B, so Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B=ρ_m (instead of zero), allowing field lines to start/end on monopoles. They also introduce a magnetic current term J_m, modifying Faraday’s law to ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−J_m, and create a full duality between electric and magnetic charges, with monopoles radiating B-fields like electric charges radiate E-fields.\nCoT agent Kbiy, determining equations with divergence and curl, thinking: Maxwell’s equations include Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) for divergence of B and the Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) for curl of B, so both divergence and curl of the magnetic field are involved.; answer: B)\nCoT agent RYWx, evaluating impact of monopoles, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero divergence of B equal to the magnetic charge density and leave Ampère’s law (the curl of B) unchanged, since monopole currents appear in Faraday’s law for E, not in Ampère’s law for B.; answer: The divergence of B becomes ∇·B=ρ_m (magnetic charge density), while the curl of B remains ∇×B=μ₀J_e+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t as in the original Ampère–Maxwell law.\nDebate agent WrQm, round 0, modifying equations, thinking: Subtask 3 identified Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and the Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B).
