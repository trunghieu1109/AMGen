    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, choice1=&#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, choice2=&#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, choice3=&#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, choice4=&#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on modified equations. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent P6jc:
Magnetic monopoles serve as sources for the magnetic field, modifying only Gauss’s law for magnetism to include a magnetic charge density term. The Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B) remains unchanged.

### answer by Final Decision Agent P6jc:
∇·B = ρ_m
∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the modified equations to the original ones to determine which specific equations are different.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
