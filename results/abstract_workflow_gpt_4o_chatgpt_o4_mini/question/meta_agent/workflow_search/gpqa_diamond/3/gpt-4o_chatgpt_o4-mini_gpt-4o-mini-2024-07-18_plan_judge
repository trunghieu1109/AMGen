Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_3
proposed answer: Only Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) is modified to include monopole density; the curl equation (Ampère–Maxwell law) is unchanged.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_3
proposed answer: Subtask 4 shows modifications to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (curl E). Subtask 5’s Ampère–Maxwell curl B change isn’t part of the monopole extension. Thus the correct match is divergence of B and circulation of E, i.e., choice 3.
