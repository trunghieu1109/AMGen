    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, choice1=&#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, choice2=&#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, choice3=&#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;, correct_index=3).
