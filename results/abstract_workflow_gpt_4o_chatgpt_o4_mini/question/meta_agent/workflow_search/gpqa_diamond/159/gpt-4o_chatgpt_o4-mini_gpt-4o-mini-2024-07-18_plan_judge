Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: For a circular aperture (N→∞) the diffraction minima occur at ka sinθ = αn where α1=3.8317 and α2=7.0156. Using sinθ≈θ and k=2π/λ gives θ1=α1λ/(2πa)=0.610 λ/a and θ2=α2λ/(2πa)=1.117 λ/a. The separation θ2−θ1=(α2−α1)λ/(2πa)=0.506 λ/a.
