    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, choice1=&#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, choice2=&#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, choice3=&#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Apply the small angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ) to the condition for the first minimum to find the angular position in terms of λ and a. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent wLVL:
Using k=2π/λ and sinθ≈θ in k·a·sinθ = 3.8317 gives θ = 3.8317/(2π) · (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent wLVL:
θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima using the derived formula and compare it with the given choices to find the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>For a circular aperture (N→∞) the diffraction minima occur at ka sinθ = αn where α1=3.8317 and α2=7.0156. Using sinθ≈θ and k=2π/λ gives θ1=α1λ/(2πa)=0.610 λ/a and θ2=α2λ/(2πa)=1.117 λ/a. The separation θ2−θ1=(α2−α1)λ/(2πa)=0.506 λ/a.
