The well‐known result is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which in the problem’s notation is E_n = n²E.; answer: For a particle in a one‐dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are \nE_n = n^2 * E,  with n = 1, 2, 3, … and E = π²ħ²/(2mL²).\nCoT agent JLLs, applying Pauli exclusion principle, thinking: To place four spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite well under Pauli exclusion, each level can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Filling from lowest energy: n=1 takes two, then n=2 takes two.; answer: Two particles occupy n=1 (one spin-up, one spin-down) and two occupy n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\nCoT-SC agent UMeY, calculating ground state energy, thinking: Each energy level n holds two spin-1/2 particles. For four particles, fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). Total energy =2(1^2E)+2(2^2E)=2E+8E=10E.; answer: 10E\nCoT-SC agent ZYZk, calculating ground state energy, thinking: Two particles occupy n=1 (energy E each) and two occupy n=2 (energy 4E each). Total energy = 2×E + 2×4E = 2E + 8E = 10E.; answer: 10E\nCoT-SC agent 3sqa, calculating ground state energy, thinking: Each level n contributes n^2E per particle. Two particles at n=1 give 2×1^2E=2E; two at n=2 give 2×2^2E=8E; total ground-state energy =2E+8E=10E.; answer: 10E\nCoT-SC agent PYzm, calculating first excited state energy, thinking: To get the first excited state, promote one of the two particles from level n=2 up to n=3. The new occupations are n=1:2 particles, n=2:1 particle, n=3:1 particle. Thus the total energy is 2·1²E + 1·2²E + 1·3²E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.; answer: 15E\nCoT-SC agent jCKO, calculating first excited state energy, thinking: Promote one of the two particles in n=2 to n=3. Then energies: 2×1^2E + 1×2^2E + 1×3^2E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.; answer: 15E\nCoT-SC agent Kpai, calculating first excited state energy, thinking: The ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2 (total 10E). For the first excited state, promote one particle from n=2 to n=3: occupancy 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 gives energy 2*1^2E + 1*2^2E + 1*3^2E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.; answer: 15E\nCoT-SC agent v1rs, calculating second excited state energy, thinking: To find the second excited state, list possible configurations above 15E. The next-lowest energy comes from having one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3: 1*1^2E + 2*2^2E + 1*3^2E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.; answer: 18E\nCoT-SC agent 18nn, calculating second excited state energy, thinking: For the second excited state, we promote the remaining particle in n=2 to the next available spatial level (n=3), giving occupancies: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. The total energy is 2·1²E + 2·3²E = 2E + 18E = 20E.; answer: 20E\nCoT-SC agent JbYA, calculating second excited state energy, thinking: Starting from the first excited configuration (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 with energy 15E), the next-lowest excitation is to promote the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3 (allowed by Pauli), giving n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. The energy is 2⋅1^2E + 2⋅3^2E = 2E + 18E = 20E.; answer: 20E\nCoT agent HtXl, comparing energies with choices, thinking: The correct energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited).
