Each energy level n can host at most two particles of opposite spin. The four‐particle states are all ways to choose four distinct single‐particle states.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5RRu:\nThe single‐particle eigenstates are |n, m_s〉 with n=1,2,3,… and m_s=±½. Pauli exclusion allows at most one particle in each |n, m_s〉, so the 4‐particle states are all combinations of four distinct pairs (n, m_s). The ground‐state configuration is {1↑,1↓,2↑,2↓}. First excited configurations arise by promoting one particle to n=3, e.g. {1↑,1↓,2↑,3↑} (and analogous choices of which spin is excited), etc.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Calculate the total energy of the system for the ground state by assigning the lowest possible energy levels to the particles, ensuring compliance with the Pauli exclusion principle. \n\n ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wHVj:\nFor four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well, the lowest single-particle levels are n=1 (E₁=E) and n=2 (E₂=4E). Each level holds two opposite-spin fermions.

The first excited state is obtained by promoting one fermion from n=2 (4E) to n=3 (9E), giving total energy = 2·E1 + E2 + E3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BQBa:\n15E\n\n### Sub-task 5: Calculate the total energy of the system for the second excited state by promoting another particle to the next available higher energy level, ensuring all conditions are met. \n\n ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zoxZ:\nFor the second excited state, after the first excitation (one particle from n=2 to n=3), the next lowest-energy configuration is achieved by promoting another particle, resulting in occupations n=1:1 particle, n=2:2 particles, and n=3:1 particle. The total energy is E₁ + 2E₂ + E₃ = 1E + 2×4E + 9E = 18E.\n\n### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent zoxZ:\n18E\n\n### Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state with the given choices to identify the correct set of energies. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OCJy (yourself):\nCalculated energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E, which correspond to choice2.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OCJy (yourself):\nB)\n\n### Review energy comparison and provide feedback. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent p6KN:\nThe ground state (10E) and first excited state (15E) are correctly identified, but the true second excited state energy is 20E (when both excited particles occupy n=3), not 18E.
