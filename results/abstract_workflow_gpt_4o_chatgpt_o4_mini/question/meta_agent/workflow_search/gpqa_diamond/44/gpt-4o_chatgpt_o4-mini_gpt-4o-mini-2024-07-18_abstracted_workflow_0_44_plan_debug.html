    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )&#39;, choice1=&#39;4E, 10E, 50E&#39;, choice2=&#39;10E, 15E, 18E\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;4E, 10E, 15E&#39;, choice4=&#39;30E, 39E, 50E&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the energy of the second excited state by promoting another particle to the next available higher energy level. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JbYA:
Starting from the first excited configuration (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 with energy 15E), the next-lowest excitation is to promote the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3 (allowed by Pauli), giving n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. The energy is 2⋅1^2E + 2⋅3^2E = 2E + 18E = 20E.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent JbYA:
20E

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the calculated energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state with the given choices to determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
