Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Using the mass‐balance approach with α = 1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]² + β3[SCN⁻]³ + β4[SCN⁻]⁴ ≈ 2.3646 gives free [Co²⁺] = 0.01/2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Then [Co(SCN)₂] = β2·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]² = 40·0.00423·0.1² ≈ 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of total Co.
