Plugging in [SCN]=0.1\u2009M and βs gives factor=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646. Thus [Co²⁺]=1×10⁻²/2.3646≈4.23×10⁻³\u2009M.; answer: 4.23e-3 M\nCoT agent Q7QG, calculating SCN- concentration, thinking: The problem statement directly gives the initial thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M, and no further adjustments are requested in this sub-task.; answer: 0.1 M\nCoT agent r82T, calculating Co(SCN)+ concentration, thinking: We use β1 = [Co(SCN)+]/([Co2+][SCN-]). From sub-task 1 [Co2+] ≈4.23×10-3 M and [SCN-]≈0.1 M, so [Co(SCN)+] = β1·[Co2+]·[SCN-] = 9·4.23×10-3·0.1 ≈3.81×10-3 M.; answer: 3.81e-3 M\nCoT agent b4FQ, calculating Co(SCN)2 concentration, thinking: We use β2=[Co(SCN)2]/([Co2+][SCN-]^2). With [Co2+]=4.23×10^-3\u2009M, [SCN-]=0.1\u2009M and β2=40, [Co(SCN)2]=40×4.23e-3×(0.1)^2=1.692×10^-3\u2009M.; answer: 1.69e-3 M\nCoT agent xSjl, calculating Co(SCN)3- concentration, thinking: We use β3 = [Co(SCN)3–]/([Co2+][SCN–]^3). With [Co2+]=4.23×10–3 M, [SCN–]=0.1 M and β3=63, we get [Co(SCN)3–] = 63×4.23e-3×(0.1)^3 ≈ 2.66×10–4 M.; answer: 2.66e-4 M\nCoT agent JYGk, calculating Co(SCN)4^2- concentration, thinking: We use β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2–]/([Co2+][SCN–]^4). With [Co2+] = 4.23×10⁻³ M, [SCN–] = 0.1 M and β4 = 16, we get [Co(SCN)4^2–] = 16 × 4.23e-3 × (0.1)^4 ≈ 6.77×10⁻⁶ M.; answer: 6.77e-6 M\nCoT agent 75Q1, summing cobalt species concentrations, thinking: Sum all species: [Co2+]=4.23e-3, [CoSCN+]=3.81e-3, [Co(SCN)2]=1.692e-3, [Co(SCN)3–]=2.66e-4, [Co(SCN)4^2–]=6.77e-6.
