    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, choice2=&#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, choice3=&#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;10^-4 eV&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated minimum energy difference with the given options (10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, 10^-4 eV) to identify which option allows the states to be clearly resolved. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent juOD:
The minimum resolvable energy difference is on the order of the larger spectral width (~7.3×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, allowing clear resolution.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent IHYv:
The minimum resolvable ΔE ≈7.3×10⁻⁷ eV; among the choices only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this, so choice D) allows clear resolution.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent YeAv:
The minimum resolvable ΔE is ≈7.3×10⁻⁷ eV; among the options only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, so choice D) allows clear resolution.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent BZF9:
The minimum resolvable energy difference is on the order of the larger uncertainty (~6.6×10⁻⁷ eV), so ΔE_min ≈7.3×10⁻⁷ eV. Among the choices only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent juOD:
D)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent IHYv:
D)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent YeAv:
D)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent BZF9:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on energy difference comparison.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
