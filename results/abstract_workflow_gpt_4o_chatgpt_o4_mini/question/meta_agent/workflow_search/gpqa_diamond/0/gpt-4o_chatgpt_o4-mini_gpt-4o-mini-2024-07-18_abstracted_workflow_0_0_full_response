Shorter lifetimes yield larger energy uncertainties. Using τ for Δt gives ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). No missing information, straightforward application.; answer: Using the energy–time uncertainty relation ΔE·Δt ≥ ħ/2, the energy uncertainty for a state of lifetime τ is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Thus τ=10⁻⁹ s ⇒ ΔE≈ħ/(2×10⁻⁹ s)≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV, and τ=10⁻⁸ s ⇒ ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV.\nCoT-SC agent GzNz, calculating energy uncertainty, thinking: Apply the energy–time uncertainty relation ΔE≈ħ/(2τ) with ħ≈6.6×10⁻¹⁶\u2009eV·s.
