Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_0
proposed answer: The minimum resolvable energy difference is on the order of the larger spectral width (~7×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, allowing the states to be clearly resolved.

Answer:D)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_0
proposed answer: To resolve two levels their separation must exceed the sum of natural linewidths ≈7×10⁻⁷ eV. Among the choices only 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than this threshold.
