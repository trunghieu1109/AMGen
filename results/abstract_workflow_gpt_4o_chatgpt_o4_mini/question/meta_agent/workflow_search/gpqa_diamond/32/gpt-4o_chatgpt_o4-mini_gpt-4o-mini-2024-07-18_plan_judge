Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_32
proposed answer: All agents consistently identified choice A based on EXO stereochemistry (trans methyls at C4/C7 and anhydride bridge anti to the former diene).

Answer:A)
