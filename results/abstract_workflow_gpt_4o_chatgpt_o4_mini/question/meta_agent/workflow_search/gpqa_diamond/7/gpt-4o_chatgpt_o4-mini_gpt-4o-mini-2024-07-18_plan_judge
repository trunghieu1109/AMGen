Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_7
proposed answer: Based on the knockout phenotypes: g2 loss causes total susceptibility, masking g1 and g3 effects (epistasis), indicating G2 is the transcription factor upstream. The partial resistances of g1 and g3 and the strong loss in g1g3 show G1 and G3 are redundant downstream.

Answer:G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, G1 and G3 function redundantly, and G2 is epistatic over both.
Extracted answer: G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, G1 and G3 function redundantly, and G2 is epistatic over both.
Correct answer: 0

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_7
proposed answer: Knockout of G2 abolishes resistance in all backgrounds, indicating G2 is the upstream transcription factor. G1 and G3 single mutants retain partial resistance, but the g1g3 double mutant shows near-zero resistance, demonstrating redundancy. The g1g3 phenotype mirrors g1 more closely, indicating G1 is epistatic to G3.
