    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, choice1=&#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, choice2=&#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, choice3=&#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, choice4=&#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 8: Select the correct conclusion regarding the genes interactions based on the analysis of resistance levels and gene interactions. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent i5wK:
Knockout of G2 leads to complete susceptibility in all backgrounds, indicating G2 is the upstream transcription factor. Single g1 and g3 mutants retain partial resistance, but the g1g3 double mutant drops to near zero, showing redundancy. Epistasis analysis shows G1 masks G3’s effect.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent YfgD:
Knockout of G2 causes complete loss of resistance in all backgrounds, indicating G2 is the upstream transcription factor. Single mutants g1 and g3 retain partial resistance, but the g1g3 double mutant shows near-zero resistance, demonstrating redundancy of G1 and G3. The g1g3 phenotype mirrors g1 more closely, indicating G1 is epistatic to G3.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 48Ol:
Knockout of G2 causes complete loss of resistance in all backgrounds, indicating G2 is the upstream transcription factor. Single mutants g1 and g3 retain partial resistance but the g1g3 double mutant shows near-zero resistance, demonstrating redundancy between G1 and G3. The phenotype of g1g3 mirrors g1 more closely, so G1 is epistatic to G3.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent XxqK:
Knockout of G2 abolishes resistance in all backgrounds, indicating it is the upstream transcription factor. G1 and G3 single mutants retain partial resistance, but the g1g3 double mutant shows near-zero resistance, demonstrating redundancy. Epistasis analysis shows the phenotype of g1g3 mirrors g1 more closely, meaning G1 is epistatic to G3.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Make final decision on conclusion.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
