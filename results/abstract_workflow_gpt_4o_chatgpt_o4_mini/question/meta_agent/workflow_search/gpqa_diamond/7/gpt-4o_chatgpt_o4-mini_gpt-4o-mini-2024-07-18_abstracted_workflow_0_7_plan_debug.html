    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, choice1=&#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, choice2=&#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, choice3=&#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, choice4=&#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Identify which gene is likely a transcription factor by evaluating the resistance levels of mutants and considering the role of transcription factors in gene regulation. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p3r6:
The g2 knockout shows a complete loss of resistance, indicating it acts upstream to regulate downstream genes, a hallmark of a transcription factor. However, phenotypic data alone aren’t definitive without molecular assays.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p3r6:
G2

### Sub-task 4: Determine if there is gene redundancy between G1 and G3 by analyzing the resistance levels of g1, g3, and g1g3 mutants. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2vga:
We compare resistance of the single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) to the double mutant g1g3 (10%). The much stronger loss of resistance in the double indicates that each gene can partially compensate for the other&#39;s function, a hallmark of genetic redundancy.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2vga:
G1 and G3 show gene redundancy

### Sub-task 5: Identify epistatic relationships by comparing the resistance levels of single and double mutants, focusing on which genes absence leads to a significant change in resistance. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent rPVf:
Epistasis is indicated when the double‐mutant phenotype matches one single mutant, showing that gene’s loss masks the other. Here g2, g1g2, and g2g3 all display 0% resistance, identical to g2 alone, so loss of G2 masks effects of losing G1 or G3.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent rPVf:
G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Draw a conclusion about the interactions between G1, G2, and G3 based on the identified transcription factor, gene redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Based on the knockout phenotypes: g2 loss causes total susceptibility, masking g1 and g3 effects (epistasis), indicating G2 is the transcription factor upstream. The partial resistances of g1 and g3 and the strong loss in g1g3 show G1 and G3 are redundant downstream.

Answer:G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, G1 and G3 function redundantly, and G2 is epistatic over both.</pre>
