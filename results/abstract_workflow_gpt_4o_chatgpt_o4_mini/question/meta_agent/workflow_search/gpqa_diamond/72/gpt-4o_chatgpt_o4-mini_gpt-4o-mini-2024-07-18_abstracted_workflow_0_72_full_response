This is straightforward and doesn’t require additional data.; answer: The relativistic velocity addition formula for two velocities u and v along the same line is: u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c^2)\nCoT agent 6CjL, understanding energy formula, thinking: The task asks to identify and understand the relativistic energy formula. The well-known formula for total energy at relativistic speeds is E = γ m c², where γ = 1/√(1−v²/c²).; answer: The relativistic total energy formula is E = γ m c², where γ = 1/√(1−v²/c²).\nCoT-SC agent vP2Q, calculating relative speed, thinking: To find the relative speed we use the relativistic velocity addition formula: u' = (u – v)/(1 – uv/c²). Here u=0.6c, v=0.5c, so u' = (0.6c–0.5c)/(1–0.6·0.5) = 0.1c/0.7 ≈0.142857c.; answer: 0.142857c\nCoT-SC agent rZi6, calculating relative speed, thinking: Using the relativistic velocity addition formula u' = (u - v) / (1 - u v / c^2). Here u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c, so u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - 0.6*0.5) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c ≈ 0.14c.; answer: 0.14c\nCoT-SC agent RImC, calculating relative speed, thinking: We apply the relativistic velocity addition formula u'=(u−v)/(1−uv/c^2) with u=0.6c and v=0.5c: u'=(0.1c)/(1−0.3)=0.1c/0.7≈0.142857c.; answer: 0.14c\nCoT-SC agent Ik02, calculating total energy, thinking: We compute the Lorentz factors γ1=1/√(1–0.6²)=1.25 and γ2=1/√(1–0.5²)≈1.1547.

For mass 2m at v=0.6c, γ=1/√(1−0.36)=1.25, so E1=1.25×2m c²=2.5 m c². For mass 3m at v=0.5c, γ=1/√(1−0.25)≈1.1547, so E2≈1.1547×3m c²≈3.464 m c².

For v₁=0.6c, γ₁=1/√(1−0.36)=1.25, so E₁=2m·1.25c²=2.5mc². For v₂=0.5c, γ₂=1/√(1−0.25)≈1.1547, so E₂=3m·1.1547c²≈3.4641mc².
