In a flat \u039bCDM universe with H\u2080=70 km/s/Mpc, \u03a9\u2098=0.3, \u03a9_\u039b=0.7, standard cosmological calculations yield a comoving distance \u22438 Gpc. This matches choice A and is fully consistent with the assumed model parameters and the observed data.\n\nAnswer:The calculated comoving distance of \u22438 Gpc is consistent with the \u039bCDM model (H\u2080=70 km/s/Mpc, \u03a9\u2098=0.3, \u03a9_\u039b=0.7) and the observed Lyman-\u03b1 break at 790 nm.",
