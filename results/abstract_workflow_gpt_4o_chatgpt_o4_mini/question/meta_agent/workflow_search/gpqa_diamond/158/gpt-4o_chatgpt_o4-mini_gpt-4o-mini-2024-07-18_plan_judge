Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_158
proposed answer: We cannot compute the comoving distance without knowing the quasar’s redshift, so we default to the most likely provided answer based on typical calculations. However, to perform the calculation accurately, the redshift is required.

Answer:A)

proposed answer: We have identified the flux drop at 790 nm as the redshifted Lyman-α break (121.6 nm), giving z≃5.5. In a flat ΛCDM universe with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, standard cosmological calculations yield a comoving distance ≃8 Gpc. This matches choice A and is fully consistent with the assumed model parameters and the observed data.

Answer:The calculated comoving distance of ≃8 Gpc is consistent with the ΛCDM model (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7) and the observed Lyman-α break at 790 nm.
