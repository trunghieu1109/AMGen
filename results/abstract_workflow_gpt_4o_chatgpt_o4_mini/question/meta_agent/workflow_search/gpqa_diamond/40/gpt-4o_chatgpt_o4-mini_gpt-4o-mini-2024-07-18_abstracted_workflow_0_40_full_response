In vacuum light travels at c=1; in a medium with index n, interactions with the bound charges slow the effective propagation by factor n.; answer: In a medium of refractive index n, the light’s phase velocity is reduced to c/n (here 1/n), because the electric field polarizes the material and the re-emitted waves combine to give an overall slower propagation.\nCoT agent MMlm, understanding relativistic effects, thinking: To find the speed of light in a moving medium as seen by the lab observer, use the relativistic velocity addition formula: u_lab = (u_medium + v)/(1 + u_medium * v), where u_medium = c/n = 1/n. Plugging in gives u_lab = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v).; answer: C)\nCoT agent GTbT, deriving formula, thinking: We use the relativistic velocity addition formula for velocities u′=c/n in the medium’s rest frame and v for the medium relative to the lab. Thus u_lab=(u′+v)/(1+u′v) with c=1 and u′=1/n gives (1/n+v)/(1+v/n).
