        "response": "We approximated the absorption energy by the emission energy of 2.3393 eV and used \u03bb=1240 nm\u00b7eV/E to get \u03bb\u2248530 nm, which lies within the green region (\u2248495\u2013570 nm) of the visible spectrum. This estimate ignores possible Stokes shifts, solvent effects, or vibronic contributions, so it remains approximate.\n\nAnswer:Green\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the actual absorption energy or an estimate of the Stokes shift to compute the absorption wavelength accurately.",
