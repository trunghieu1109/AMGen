Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_29
proposed answer: We approximated the absorption energy by the emission energy of 2.3393 eV and used λ=1240 nm·eV/E to get λ≈530 nm, which lies within the green region (≈495–570 nm) of the visible spectrum. This estimate ignores possible Stokes shifts, solvent effects, or vibronic contributions, so it remains approximate.

Answer:Green

Please provide the actual absorption energy or an estimate of the Stokes shift to compute the absorption wavelength accurately.
Extracted answer: Green
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_29
proposed answer: Emission at 530 nm implies absorption at a shorter wavelength (around 500 nm), which lies in the blue–green region. Among the options (Blue, Yellow, Red, Violet), blue is the closest match, though without the absorption spectrum or known Stokes shift this remains an estimate.
