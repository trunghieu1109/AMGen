    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.&#39;, choice1=&#39;220-240&#39;, choice2=&#39;140-160&#39;, choice3=&#39;160-180&#39;, choice4=&#39;110-130&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Determine the molecular formula of A4 based on its reaction with element Y to form A5. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent hZYm:
A4 must be a colorless Pu fluorocomplex that forms a concentrated solution and reacts with Pu metal to yield A5. The most plausible candidate is the hexafluoroplutonate(VI) acid, H2PuF6, which is colorless in solution. However, without details on A5 or its aqueous decomposition, this assignment remains tentative.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent hZYm:
H2PuF6
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the identity or reaction products of A5 (and its decomposition in water) to confirm the formula of A4.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and determine the range it falls into.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
