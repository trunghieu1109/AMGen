Ozonolysis of the cis-alkene gives a vicinal dialdehyde, and Ba(OH)2 under basic conditions triggers a benzilic\u2010acid rearrangement to an \u03b1-hydroxy acid, not the desired product. There is no chemoselective reduction or protection step to convert only one aldehyde to an alcohol, nor is regiocontrol in ozonolysis addressed. Further detail is needed to design a selective transformation.\n\nAnswer:The selected reagent sequence is incorrect.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease propose a chemoselective reducing agent or a protection/deprotection strategy to selectively reduce one carbonyl to an alcohol while preserving the other as an aldehyde.",
