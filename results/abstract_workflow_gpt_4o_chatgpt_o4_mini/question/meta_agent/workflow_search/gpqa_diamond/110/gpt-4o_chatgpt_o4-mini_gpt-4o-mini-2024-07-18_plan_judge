Question: Example(question='Complete the following reactions and select the major products by considering the steric hindrance, and the stability of the products.\n2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B', choice1='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile', choice2='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile', choice3='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile', choice4='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_110
proposed answer: The Michael addition of the nitronate from 1-nitropropane to the Î²-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile is both sterically and electronically favored, yielding the more substituted and stable adduct as the major product.
