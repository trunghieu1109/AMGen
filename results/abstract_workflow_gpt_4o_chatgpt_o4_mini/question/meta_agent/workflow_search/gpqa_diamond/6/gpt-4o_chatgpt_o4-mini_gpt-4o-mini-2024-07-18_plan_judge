Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_6
proposed answer: Compute the product E_γ·ε using E_γ=2.6×10^14 eV and ε=10^−3 eV: E_γ·ε=2.6×10^11 eV^2, which matches (m_e c^2)^2≈2.61×10^11 eV^2, so the threshold condition is satisfied.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_17_6
proposed answer: To verify, use the pair-production threshold E_γ ε ≥ (m_e c^2)^2. With ε≈10⁻³ eV and m_e c^2=0.511 MeV, E_γ ≈ (0.511×10⁶ eV)²/10⁻³ eV ≈ 2.6×10¹⁴ eV = 2.6×10⁵ GeV, matching choice C).
