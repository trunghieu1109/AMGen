From KE = 169 MeV and rest energy = 300 MeV, γ = 1 + 169/300 ≃ 1.563, and β = √(1 − 1/γ²) ≃ 0.77, so the result is sound.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Use the kinetic energy and rest energy of particle A to calculate its velocity. \n\n ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent D9f4 (yourself):\nEach A has kinetic energy KE = 676 MeV/4 = 169 MeV and rest energy m c^2 = 300 MeV, so γ = 1 + KE/(m c^2) ≃ 1 + 169/300 ≃ 1.563. Then β = sqrt(1 − 1/γ²) ≃ sqrt(1 − 1/2.443) ≃ 0.77.\n\n### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent D9f4 (yourself):\nC)\n\n### Review velocity calculation and provide feedback. \n\n ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent mURU:\nThe step-by-step γ and β calculation is correct: each A has total energy E = m c² + KE = 300\u2009MeV + 169\u2009MeV = 469\u2009MeV, so γ = 469/300 ≃ 1.563 and β = √(1–1/γ²) ≃ 0.77.
