Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_146
proposed answer: Each A has total energy E ≈ 1876 MeV / 4 ≈ 469 MeV, giving γ = E/(mc²) ≈ 469/300 ≈ 1.56, so β = √(1–1/γ²) ≈ 0.77, matching choice C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_146
proposed answer: Each A has KE = 676 MeV/4 = 169 MeV and rest energy = 300 MeV, so γ = 1 + 169/300 ≃ 1.563, and β = √(1 – 1/γ²) ≃ 0.77.
