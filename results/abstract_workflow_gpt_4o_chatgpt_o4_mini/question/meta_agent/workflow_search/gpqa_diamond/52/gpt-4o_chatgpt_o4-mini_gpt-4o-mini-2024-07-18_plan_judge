Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_52
proposed answer: All reasoning agents agree that the para-substituted benzene (C6H4) plus methyl ester (CO2Me) plus propenyl (C3H5) sums to C11H12O2, matching choice D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_52
proposed answer: The para-disubstituted benzene (C6H4), one ring methyl and a methacrylate ester (–O–C(=O)–C(CH3)=CH2) yield C11H14O2. No –CH2 groups and two methyl singlets fit H=14 and O2.
