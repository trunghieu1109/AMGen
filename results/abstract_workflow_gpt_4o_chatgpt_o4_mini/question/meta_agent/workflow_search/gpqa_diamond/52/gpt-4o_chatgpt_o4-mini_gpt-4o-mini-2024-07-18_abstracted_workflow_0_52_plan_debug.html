    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.&#39;, choice1=&#39;C12H14O2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C12H12O2&#39;, choice3=&#39;C11H14O2&#39;, choice4=&#39;C11H12O2&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 5: Match the possible structural arrangements with the given chemical formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) to identify the correct formula. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent HzzA:
A para-substituted benzene (C6H4) plus a methyl ester (CO2Me, C2H3O2) and a propenyl substituent (C3H5) gives total formula C11H12O2, corresponding to choice D).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Ip81:
A para‐substituted benzene (C6H4) plus a methyl ester (CO2Me, C2H3O2) and a 1-propenyl group (C3H5) sums to C11H12O2, corresponding to choice4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent uGOE:
A para-substituted benzene (C6H4) plus a methyl ester (CO2Me, C2H3O2) and a propenyl group (C3H5) sum to C11H12O2.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent kNPK:
A para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) plus a methyl ester (CO2Me, C2H3O2) and a propenyl group (CH=CH–CH3, C3H5) gives C11H12O2, which corresponds to choice D).
