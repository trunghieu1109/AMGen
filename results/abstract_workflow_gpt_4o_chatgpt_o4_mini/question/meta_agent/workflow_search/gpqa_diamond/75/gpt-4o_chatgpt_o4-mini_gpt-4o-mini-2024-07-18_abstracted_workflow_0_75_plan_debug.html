    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?&#39;, choice1=&#39;green signal colocalizes with the red signal&#39;, choice2=&#39;there is no green signal&#39;, choice3=&#39;cell line-specific red signals label different organelles&#39;, choice4=&#39;cytoplasmic localization of the red signal&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on observation. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent OjG4:
The majority of agents observe no overlap of TUNEL–FITC green signal with mRaspberry red-labeled iPSCs across all images and Z-stacks, making the absence of green signal the most prominent finding.

### answer by Final Decision Agent OjG4:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Apply the understanding of the experimental setup and observations to determine the first noticeable feature when observing the embryos under the confocal microscope.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
