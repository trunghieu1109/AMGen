proposed answer: The proposed base‐promoted aldol condensation of cyclopentanone yields a mono‐condensed product (2-(cyclopentylidene)cyclopentanone), not the symmetrical R–CO–R ketone with two cyclopentylidene groups. Thus the sequence fails to produce [1,1′-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one.

Answer:The theoretical outcome does not match the target compound; the sequence is incorrect.
Extracted answer: The theoretical outcome does not match the target compound; the sequence is incorrect.
