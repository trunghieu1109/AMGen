Example(question=&#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, choice1=&#39;15&#39;, choice2=&#39;13&#39;, choice3=&#39;17&#39;, choice4=&#39;19&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B based on their deduced chemical formulas. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent kyD0:
Based on the tentative formulas A = M(NO₃)₂·2H₂O and B = M′(N₃)₂, salt A contains 1 M + 2 N + 8 O + 4 H = 15 atoms and salt B contains 1 M′ + 6 N = 7 atoms, for a total of 22 atoms. However, without confirmation of the metal cation identities, these formulas and the atom count remain provisional.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent mw4w:
Assuming A = M(NO3)2·2H2O contains 1 M + 2 N + 8 O + 4 H = 15 atoms and B = M&#39;(N3)2 contains 1 M&#39; + 6 N = 7 atoms, the sum is 22 atoms. However, without knowing M and M&#39; identities this atom count remains provisional.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent HG46:
A = M(NO₃)₂·2H₂O contains 1 M + 2 N + 6 O (from NO₃) + 2 O (from H₂O) + 4 H = 15 atoms; B = M′(N₃)₂ contains 1 M′ + 6 N = 7 atoms; total = 15 + 7 = 22.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent rLTc:
Based on the tentative formulas A = M(NO₃)₂·2H₂O and B = M′(N₃)₂, salt A contains 1 M + 2 N + 8 O + 4 H = 15 atoms and salt B contains 1 M′ + 6 N = 7 atoms, giving a total of 22 atoms. However, the exact identities of the metal cations M and M′ remain unknown, so the formulas—and thus the atom count—cannot be fully confirmed without additional data.

[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the identities or masses of the metal cations M and M′ from the solid residues to confirm the exact salt formulas and atom count.

[TOO_HARD]
Please determine the identities or masses of the metal cations M and M′ from the solid residues to confirm the exact salt formulas and atom count.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on total number of atoms.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
