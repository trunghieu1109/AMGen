Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_63
proposed answer: The previous calculation yielded a total of 13 atoms in salts A and B, matching choice2. Therefore, the correct answer is B).
