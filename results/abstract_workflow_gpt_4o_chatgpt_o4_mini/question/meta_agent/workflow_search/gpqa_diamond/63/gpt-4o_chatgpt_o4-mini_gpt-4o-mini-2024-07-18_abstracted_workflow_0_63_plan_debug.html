Example(question=&#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, choice1=&#39;15&#39;, choice2=&#39;13&#39;, choice3=&#39;17&#39;, choice4=&#39;19&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B based on the reactions and the remaining gas C. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent eiGD:
Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ uptake of 3.60 g corresponds to 0.200 mol H₂O. CuO formed (0.80 g) is 0.010 mol, so O₂ consumed is 0.005 mol. Remaining gas C is 2.24 L = 0.100 mol. Thus total O₂ produced = 0.100 + 0.005 = 0.105 mol. From the equimolar salt mixture (7.20 g), stoichiometric analysis yields a total of 13 atoms in salts A and B.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent eiGD:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Verify the calculated number of atoms against the given choices and determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
