Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_9
proposed answer: The densities calculated are: a) 5.51 g/cm³, b) 5.5 g/cm³, c) ≈7.5 g/cm³, d) ≈4.8 g/cm³. Option c has the highest density.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_9
proposed answer: Based on computed densities, option a has ≃5.51 g/cm³ versus ≃5.5 g/cm³ for the others, so a is highest.
