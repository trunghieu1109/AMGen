Thus for M=5M⊕, R≈R⊕·5^0.27≈1.54R⊕, so volume≈1.54^3≈3.65\u2009V⊕. Density=5\u2009M⊕/3.65\u2009V⊕≈1.37\u2009ρ⊕≈1.37·5.5\u2009g/cm³≈7.5\u2009g/cm³.; answer: Approximately 7.5 g/cm³.\nCoT agent TprT, estimating density for option d, thinking: For a rocky planet with the same composition as Earth, radius scales roughly as R∝M^0.27 (for M≲5 M⊕). Mean density ρ∝M/R^3 ∝M^(1–3×0.27)=M^0.19.
