The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is characteristic of NH2 protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets (2H each) correspond to two sets of aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.; answer: Triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H): CH3 of an ethyl group; Quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H): CH2 of the ethyl group; Broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H): NH2 protons; Doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H): two sets of aromatic H in a para-disubstituted benzene.\nCoT agent zztk, identifying functional groups, thinking: The IR peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 indicate N–H stretches (such as a primary amine), and the strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group.; answer: N–H (amine) stretch and C=O stretch\nCoT agent 1gqj, identifying structural implications, thinking: The NMR data show a 1.2\u2009ppm triplet and 4.5\u2009ppm quartet characteristic of an ethyl fragment, a broad 2\u2009H singlet at 4.0\u2009ppm typical of an NH2, and two sets of aromatic doublets (2\u2009H each) indicating a para-disubstituted benzene ring. This pattern points to a para‐substituted benzoate bearing an ethyl ester and an amino group.; answer: The 1H NMR implies an ethyl ester (CH3 triplet & CH2 quartet), a free NH2 (broad singlet, 2H), and a para-disubstituted benzene (two 2H doublets), consistent with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\nDebate agent End4, round 0, matching features, thinking: The IR shows N–H and C=O, NMR shows ethyl ester (triplet/quartet), NH2, para-disubstituted benzene.
