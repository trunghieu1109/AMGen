    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.&#39;, choice1=&#39;22&#39;, choice2=&#39;12&#39;, choice3=&#39;16&#39;, choice4=&#39;18&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on structures of compounds in mixture X. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent SO95:
Mixture X components must be C6H10 nonconjugated alkenes that decolorize Br2 and fully hydrogenate to cyclohexane; the only plausible structures are cyclohexene and a methylcyclopentene isomer. Without spectroscopic or boiling-point data, the exact position of the double bond in methylcyclopentene cannot be uniquely determined.

### answer by Final Decision Agent SO95:
Cyclohexene and 1-methylcyclopentene
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide spectroscopic (e.g., NMR, IR) or boiling-point data to unambiguously determine the exact methylcyclopentene isomer.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X using the structures determined in subtask 5.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 H atoms. 1-Methylcyclopentene (C6H10) also has 10 H atoms. Therefore the total H atoms in the two components is 10 + 10 = 20.
