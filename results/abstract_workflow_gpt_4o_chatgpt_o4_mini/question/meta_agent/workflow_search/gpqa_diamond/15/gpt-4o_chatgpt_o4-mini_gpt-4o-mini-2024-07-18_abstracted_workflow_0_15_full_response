(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no sp3 stereocenter, only a Z double bond (no optical activity).\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: two sp3 stereocenters at C3a and C7a plus an E-alkene.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: two sp3 stereocenters at C2 and C3; R,S configuration gives a meso compound (internal mirror plane).\n4.

(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three sp3 stereocenters at C1, C3 and C5 (all same configuration).\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one sp3 stereocenter at C3 (bearing methyl, H, and two different chain substituents).\nCoT-SC agent PacM, determining symmetry, thinking: We examine each structure for symmetry elements that would render it achiral despite stereocenters or indicate chirality: 1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene has no sp³ stereocenter and no chiral axis; it is achiral. 2. The bicyclic 8-(chloromethylene) derivative has two stereocenters and lacks an internal mirror plane; it is chiral. 3. (2R,3S)-2,3-Dimethylsuccinic acid is meso (internal mirror plane through C2–C3 bond); achiral. 4. (2R,3R)-2,3-Dimethylsuccinic acid has two like-configured stereocenters and no symmetry plane; chiral. 5. (R)-Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has one stereocenter and no symmetry; chiral. 6. (1s,3s,5s)-Cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol has three same-configured stereocenters and no mirror plane (C₃ but no σ); chiral. 7. 1-Cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one has one stereocenter and no symmetry; chiral.; answer: 1: achiral (no chirality element)\n2: chiral (no σ plane)\n3: achiral (meso, internal σ)\n4: chiral (no σ)\n5: chiral (no σ)\n6: chiral (C3 axis, no σ)\n7: chiral (no σ)\nCoT-SC agent 92RT, determining symmetry, thinking: We need to inspect each structure for symmetry elements that would render it achiral even if stereocenters are present. 1) No sp3 center; trivial achiral. 2) Two stereocenters in a rigid bicyclic without internal mirror; chiral. 3) R,S diastereomer of succinic acid; internal mirror plane → meso, achiral. 4) R,R Succinic acid; no symmetry → chiral. 5) Monosubstituted cyclohexenol; no plane through C1 → chiral. 6) 1,3,5-triol all same configuration on cyclohexane gives D3 symmetry (C3 axis only) with no mirror plane → chiral. 7) One sp3 center with four different substituents; no plane → chiral.; answer: 1) achiral (no stereocenter)\n2) no symmetry plane → chiral\n3) internal mirror plane → achiral (meso)\n4) no symmetry plane → chiral\n5) no symmetry plane → chiral\n6) no mirror plane (C3 axis only) → chiral\n7) no symmetry plane → chiral\nCoT-SC agent oUrg, determining symmetry, thinking: The sub-task asks for a detailed analysis of each compound's symmetry elements, not a single-letter multiple-choice answer. Per the instructions, if no alphabet choice applies, respond with [ERROR].; answer: [ERROR]\nReflexion CoT agent ZcIU, selecting compounds, thinking: Based on sub-task analyses, compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 each have stereocenters and no internal mirror plane, thus are optically active.; answer: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\nCritic agent N6vK, providing feedback, thinking: The selection by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZcIU correctly excludes 1 (no stereocenter) and 3 (meso succinic acid) and includes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, each of which bears stereocenters. However, assessing optical activity in bicyclic frameworks (2) and conformationally flexible rings (5, 6) without clear 3D structures can lead to misjudging internal symmetry and dynamic racemization. In addition, compound 7’s substituent environments must be carefully compared to confirm a true stereocenter.; answer: The choice of 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 is reasonable but constrained by missing structural detail and conformational context. [TOO_HARD]\nRequest detailed stereochemical drawings or 3D models for each compound and decompose the analysis into: (1) identification of every stereocenter, (2) search for internal mirror planes/axes in a fixed conformation, and (3) evaluation of any dynamic processes (e.g. ring flips) that could render the molecule achiral or racemize it.\nReflexion CoT agent ZcIU, refining compound selection, thinking: The prompt requests a selection for sub-task 3 but does not provide multiple-choice options, so no single alphabet choice applies.; answer: [ERROR]\nCritic agent N6vK, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed selection fails to account for meso and symmetric conformers. For example, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is meso (achiral) despite two stereocenters, and (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol can adopt a plane of symmetry in its preferred chair conformation. Without conformational analysis or experimental optical‐rotation data, assignments of optical activity remain uncertain.\n[TOO_HARD]\nRequest detailed 3D conformations or polarimetry data to confirm which compounds truly lack internal symmetry and are optically active.; answer: Best current selection: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\nReflexion CoT agent ZcIU, refining compound selection, thinking: Based on the identified stereocenters and symmetry analyses, compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 each bear chiral centers and lack obvious internal mirror planes, indicating potential optical activity. However, without explicit 3D structures or experimental rotation data, conformational symmetries (e.g., in bicyclic systems or flexible rings) and meso-like arrangements cannot be fully ruled out.; answer: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\n[TOO_HARD]\nRequest detailed 3D conformations or polarimetry data to confirm the absence of internal symmetry and true optical activity.\nCritic agent N6vK, providing feedback, thinking: The selection incorrectly includes compounds 2 and 6, both of which are meso (having internal planes of symmetry) and thus optically inactive, while correctly including 4, 5, and 7. Without explicit 3D conformational data or experimental rotation measurements, one cannot fully rule out hidden symmetry elements in bicyclic or flexible rings.; answer: 4, 5, 7\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide detailed 3D conformations or polarimetry data to confirm the absence of internal symmetry in the selected structures.\nReflexion CoT agent ZcIU, refining compound selection, thinking: Based on the presence of stereocenters and the absence of obvious internal mirror planes in the drawn structures, compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 each appear to be chiral and thus potentially optically active.
