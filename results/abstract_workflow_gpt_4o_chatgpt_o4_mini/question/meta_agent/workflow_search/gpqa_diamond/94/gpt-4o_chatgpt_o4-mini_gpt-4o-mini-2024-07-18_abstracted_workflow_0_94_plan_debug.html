Example(question=&#39;3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:&#39;, choice1=&#39;4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol&#39;, choice2=&#39;2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol&#39;, choice3=&#39;5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one&#39;, choice4=&#39;6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 6: Analyze the possible products formed from the reaction of the methyllithium-copper(I) iodide complex with the product mixture. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J2np:
The Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi) opens each epoxide at the less substituted carbon to give two methylated keto‐alcohols. Without stereochemical detail we can name the two regioisomers, but cannot assign configurations.


### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent J2np:
The reaction will give two methylated keto-alcohols: from the C1–C2 epoxide, 2-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one, and from the C5–C6 epoxide, 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the cis/trans and absolute stereochemistry of each epoxide intermediate to fully predict the configuration at the new stereocenters.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the possible products with the given choices and identify the correct product.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
