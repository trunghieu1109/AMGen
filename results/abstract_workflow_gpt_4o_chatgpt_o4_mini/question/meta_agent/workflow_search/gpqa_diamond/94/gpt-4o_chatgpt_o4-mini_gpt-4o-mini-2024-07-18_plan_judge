Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_94
proposed answer: The Gilman reagent opens the epoxide at the less substituted carbon, yielding a keto-alcohol with OH at C6 and trimethyl groups at C2 and C5. Only choice 4 matches 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one.

Answer:D)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_94
proposed answer: The organocuprate Me2CuLi selectively opens the less hindered 5,6-epoxide at C6, installing a methyl and upon protonation yields the hydroxy ketone 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one, corresponding to choice C.
