At equilibrium [Ca²⁺]=[EDTA⁴⁻]=x and [CaEDTA²⁻]≈0.02\u2009M. So x² = 0.02/5×10¹⁰ = 4×10⁻¹³, x = √(4×10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷\u2009M.; answer: 6.3×10⁻⁷\u2009M\nCritic agent owTz, providing feedback, thinking: The solution correctly applies the formation constant expression Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA]) and, by setting [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA] = x, solves x² = 0.02/5×10¹⁰ = 4×10⁻¹³. The square root gives x ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, matching the expected result.; answer: 6.3×10⁻⁷ M\nReflexion CoT agent cfsj, refining concentration calculation, thinking: Using Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) = 5×10^10, with [CaEDTA]≈0.02 M and [Ca2+]=[EDTA]=x gives x^2 = 0.02/5×10^10 = 4×10^-13, so x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: C)\nCritic agent owTz, providing feedback, thinking: The equilibrium calculation is correct. Using Kf=[CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) with [CaEDTA]=0.02 M and assuming [Ca2+]=[EDTA]=x gives x^2=0.02/5×10^10=4×10^−13, so x≈6.3×10^−7 M. Choice 3 (6.3×10^−7 M) is correct.; answer: 6.3×10^−7 M\nReflexion CoT agent cfsj, refining concentration calculation, thinking: We apply the formation constant expression Kf = [CaEDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5×10¹⁰. Let [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x and [CaEDTA²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M.

Using Kf=[CaEDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])=5×10¹⁰ and assuming [Ca²⁺]=[EDTA⁴⁻]=x with [CaEDTA²⁻]=0.02 M gives x²=0.02/(5×10¹⁰)=4×10⁻¹³, so x≈6.3×10⁻⁷ M.; answer: 6.3×10⁻⁷ M\nReflexion CoT agent cfsj, refining concentration calculation, thinking: We use the formation constant expression Kf = [CaEDTA2–]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]) = 5×10^10. Let [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–] = x and [CaEDTA2–] = 0.02 M.
