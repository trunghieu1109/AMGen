Here the reaction is CaY2– ⇌ Ca2+ + Y4–, so KCa-EDTA = [Ca2+][Y4–]/[CaY2–].; answer: KCa-EDTA = [Ca2+][Y4–] / [CaY2–]\nCoT agent VQYW, setting up equilibrium expression, thinking: We identify the dissociation: CaY2– ⇌ Ca2+ + Y4–, K = [CaY2–]/([Ca2+][Y4–]). Let x = [Ca2+]eq = [Y4–]eq, initial [CaY2–] = 0.02 M, so [CaY2–]eq = 0.02 – x. Thus K = (0.02 – x)/(x·x).; answer: 5×10^10 = (0.02 – x)/x^2\nCoT agent hm7Z, solving equilibrium expression, thinking: We solve the equilibrium K = (0.02 – x)/x². Since K is large, x << 0.02, so x² ≈ 0.02/5×10¹⁰ = 4×10⁻¹³ and x ≈ √(4×10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 4CvW, round 0, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈6.3×10^-7\u2009M, which matches choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent cx8v, round 0, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] is 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which matches choice 3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent Fpeg, round 0, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] is 6.3×10−7 M, which matches choice3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent AMHG, round 0, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] is 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which matches choice3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 4CvW, round 1, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] is approximately 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent cx8v, round 1, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which directly matches choice 3 (C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent Fpeg, round 1, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] is approximately 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent AMHG, round 1, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈6.3×10^-7 M corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent 4CvW, round 2, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M matches choice C.; answer: C)\nDebate agent cx8v, round 2, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M matches choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent Fpeg, round 2, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈6.3×10⁻⁷ M matches choice C.; answer: C)\nDebate agent AMHG, round 2, comparing calculated concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M corresponds to choice C).; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent, determining correct concentration, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M matches choice C.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
