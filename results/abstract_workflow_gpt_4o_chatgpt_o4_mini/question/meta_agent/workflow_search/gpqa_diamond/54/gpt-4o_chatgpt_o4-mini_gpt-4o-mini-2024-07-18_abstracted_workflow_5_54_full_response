The 1.6 ppm doublet (J=7 Hz) is the alkene‐methyl, and the 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. This connectivity (OCOCH₃–CH=CH–CH₃) and large trans coupling constant confirm the E‐stereochemistry.; answer: 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16 Hz; 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq, J=16, 7 Hz; 2.1 ppm: 3H, s; 1.6 ppm: 3H, d, J=7 Hz ⇒ trans‐propenyl acetate (E‐alkene)\nCritic agent ZDVo, providing feedback, thinking: Splitting patterns are assigned using the n+1 rule for first-order systems and by measuring coupling constants (J) to distinguish vicinal (3J), geminal (2J) or long-range (4J+) couplings. For example, a large J≈16 Hz identifies a trans-alkene, J≈7 Hz denotes coupling to a methyl, and a singlet indicates no adjacent protons.  However, limitations arise:; answer: • Second-order effects when Δδ is similar to J, producing distorted multiplets.\n• Overlapping signals in crowded regions obscure splitting.\n• Diastereotopic or chemically non-equivalent protons can give complex patterns beyond n+1.\n• Broadening due to exchange (e.g., OH, NH) hides fine structure.\n• Weak long-range couplings (<1 Hz) may be unresolved.\n• Coupling to heteroatoms (e.g., 31P, 19F) complicates spectra.\n• Conformational averaging can change observed J values.\nReflexion CoT agent egtx, refining splitting pattern determination, thinking: The large 16 Hz coupling between the 7.0 ppm doublet and the 5.5 ppm component indicates a trans‐alkene. The 5.5 ppm signal’s additional 7 Hz coupling to the 1.6 ppm methyl (doublet) confirms CH=CH–CH₃ connectivity. The 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetyl methyl. These splittings and J values unambiguously assign a trans‐propenyl acetate.; answer: 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16 Hz; 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq, J=16, 7 Hz; 1.6 ppm: 3H, d, J=7 Hz; 2.1 ppm: 3H, s. ⇒ trans-propenyl acetate (E-alkene)\nCritic agent ZDVo, providing feedback, thinking: The splitting pattern determination accurately identifies the key couplings: the 7.0 ppm doublet (J = 16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm dq (J = 16, 7 Hz) confirm an E-alkene with CH=CH–CH₃ connectivity, and the 2.1 ppm singlet unmistakably corresponds to the acetyl methyl.; answer: Splitting pattern review:\n• 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq, J = 16, 7 Hz) indicate trans-alkene coupling and adjacent methyl group coupling.\n• 1.6 ppm (3H, d, J = 7 Hz) couples to the 5.5 ppm proton.\n• 2.1 ppm (3H, s) is the acetyl methyl.\nLimitations:\n• Overlapping signals or coincident chemical shifts can obscure patterns in complex spectra.\n• Second-order (non-first-order) effects when Δδ ≈ J complicate multiplet assignments.\n• Small long-range couplings (4J, 5J) may be undetected.\n• Solvent, temperature, and concentration effects can broaden or shift peaks.\n• Low signal-to-noise or low concentration reduces resolution of fine splittings.\nReflexion CoT agent egtx, refining splitting pattern determination, thinking: The large 16 Hz coupling between the 7.0 and 5.5 ppm signals indicates a trans (E) alkene. The 5.5 ppm dq’s 7 Hz coupling to the 1.6 ppm methyl (d) confirms CH=CH–CH₃ connectivity, and the 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. Thus, splittings and J values unambiguously assign trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16 Hz; 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq, J=16, 7 Hz; 1.6 ppm: 3H, d, J=7 Hz; 2.1 ppm: 3H, s ⇒ trans-propenyl acetate (E-alkene)\nCritic agent ZDVo, providing feedback, thinking: The subtask answer accurately applies the n+1 rule and coupling constants to assign the trans‐alkene geometry, but one must be aware of experimental and spectral limitations when interpreting splitting patterns.; answer: Splitting patterns are assigned by applying the n+1 rule—each proton’s multiplicity reflects the number of equivalent neighboring protons—and measuring J‐values to infer connectivity and stereochemistry (e.g. J≈16 Hz for trans alkene, ≈10 Hz for cis). \nLimitations:\n• Overlapping signals can mask true multiplicities and coupling constants.\n• Small or similar J‐values may not be resolved, leading to ambiguous assignments.\n• Second‐order (non first‐order) effects occur when chemical shift differences approach coupling constants, distorting multiplet shapes.\n• Long‐range (4J, 5J) couplings or coupling to nonproton nuclei can complicate patterns.\n• Dynamic processes (exchange, conformational averaging) can collapse or broaden splittings.\n• Solvent and concentration effects can alter coupling constants.  \nWhen ambiguities arise, complementary experiments (e.g. 2D COSY, NOESY), higher field NMR, or selective decoupling may be required for unambiguous structural assignment.\nReflexion CoT agent egtx, refining splitting pattern determination, thinking: The 7.0 ppm doublet (J = 16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets (J = 16, 7 Hz) arise from vicinal coupling across a trans‐alkene (large Jtrans ≈ 16 Hz) and coupling of the β-alkene proton to the methyl group (J ≈ 7 Hz). The 1.6 ppm doublet (J = 7 Hz) is the alkene‐methyl, and the 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. These splittings and J values define the connectivity OCOCH3–CH=CH–CH3 with E stereochemistry.; answer: 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16 Hz; 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq, J=16,7 Hz; 1.6 ppm: 3H, d, J=7 Hz; 2.1 ppm: 3H, s ⇒ trans-propenyl acetate (E)\nCoT agent YtXB, extracting features of candidate compounds, thinking: To distinguish the four isomers, we need to note (1) the vinyl–vinyl coupling constant (cis ~10 Hz vs trans ~16 Hz), (2) the presence or absence of an O–CH2– group (butenyl vs propenyl), (3) characteristic chemical shifts and multiplicities for each proton type.; answer: Cis-propenyl acetate:\n• Two vinyl Hs: ~7.0 ppm (d, J≈10 Hz), ~5.6 ppm (d, J≈10 Hz)\n• Vinyl Me: ~1.7 ppm (d, J≈7 Hz)\n• Acetate Me: ~2.1 ppm (s)\n\nTrans-propenyl acetate:\n• Two vinyl Hs: ~7.0 ppm (d, J≈16 Hz), ~6.4 ppm (d, J≈16 Hz)\n• Vinyl Me: ~1.7 ppm (d, J≈7 Hz)\n• Acetate Me: ~2.1 ppm (s)\n\nCis-butenyl acetate (2-butenyl acetate):\n• Two vinyl Hs: ~5.9 ppm (d, J≈10 Hz), ~5.3 ppm (d, J≈10 Hz)\n• O–CH2–: ~4.9 ppm (t, J≈6–7 Hz)\n• CH2 next to vinyl: ~2.2 ppm (m)\n• Terminal Me: ~1.0 ppm (t, J≈7 Hz)\n• Acetate Me: ~2.1 ppm (s)\n\nTrans-butenyl acetate:\n• Two vinyl Hs: ~5.9 ppm (d, J≈16 Hz), ~5.3 ppm (d, J≈16 Hz)\n• O–CH2–: ~4.9 ppm (t, J≈6–7 Hz)\n• CH2 next to vinyl: ~2.2 ppm (m)\n• Terminal Me: ~1.0 ppm (t, J≈7 Hz)\n• Acetate Me: ~2.1 ppm (s)\nDebate agent phEF, round 0, comparing NMR features, thinking: The unknown shows two vinyl protons at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (dq, J=16,7 Hz), a vinyl methyl at 1.6 ppm (d, J=7 Hz), and an acetate methyl at 2.1 ppm (s). Only trans-propenyl acetate has a trans coupling of ~16 Hz between the vinyl Hs, a vinyl H coupling to a methyl (~7 Hz) giving a dq, the correct vinyl methyl doublet, and the acetate methyl singlet.

No O–CH2– signals appear, so it’s a propenyl acetate. The large J=16\u2009Hz indicates a trans‐alkene.; answer: A)\nDebate agent ChUx, round 0, comparing NMR features, thinking: We compare the unknown’s 1H NMR signals (7.0 ppm d, J=16\u2009Hz; 5.5 ppm dq; 2.1 ppm s; 1.6 ppm d) with the expected patterns:\n\nTrans-propenyl acetate: vinyl Hs as doublets with J≈16\u2009Hz (one at ~7.0, one at ~6.4), vinyl Me as d (J≈7\u2009Hz), acetate Me as s, no O–CH2–.

The unknown shows a 7.0\u2009ppm doublet (J\u2009=\u200916\u2009Hz), a 5.5\u2009ppm doublet of quartets (large J\u2009≈\u200916\u2009Hz to the other vinyl H and small J\u2009≈\u20097\u2009Hz to a methyl), a 2.1\u2009ppm singlet (acetate Me), and a 1.6\u2009ppm doublet (vinyl Me, J\u2009≈\u20097\u2009Hz). Cis-propenyl acetate would show J\u2009≈\u200910\u2009Hz, so it is excluded. Both butenyl acetates have an O–CH2 signal (~4.9\u2009ppm), which is absent. Trans-butenyl likewise has O–CH2. The only match is trans-propenyl acetate, whose vinyl protons couple across the double bond with J\u2009≈\u200916\u2009Hz and one vinyl proton also couples to the vinyl methyl, giving the observed dq at 5.5\u2009ppm.; answer: Trans-propenyl acetate\nDebate agent phEF, round 1, comparing NMR features, thinking: We compare each candidate’s expected NMR pattern to the unknown’s signals: 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (dq, J=16,7 Hz), 2.1 ppm (s), 1.6 ppm (d, J=7 Hz). Cis-propenyl acetate would have cis-J≈10 Hz, not 16 Hz. Both butenyl acetates require an O–CH2 signal (~4.9 ppm) and a CH2 multiplet, which the unknown lacks.

Trans coupling (16 Hz) and absence of O–CH2 only fit trans-propenyl acetate; cis isomer shows ~10 Hz, and butenyl acetates require CH2 signals.; answer: Cis-propenyl acetate: mismatch (Jcis≈10 Hz vs observed 16 Hz)\nTrans-propenyl acetate: match (trans J≈16 Hz; dq at 5.5 ppm; correct Me signals; no O–CH2)\nCis-butenyl acetate: mismatch (requires O–CH2 and CH2 signals)\nTrans-butenyl acetate: mismatch (requires O–CH2 and CH2 signals)\nDebate agent S3nZ, round 2, comparing NMR features, thinking: To match the unknown’s NMR to each candidate, we compare coupling constants and signal sets.
