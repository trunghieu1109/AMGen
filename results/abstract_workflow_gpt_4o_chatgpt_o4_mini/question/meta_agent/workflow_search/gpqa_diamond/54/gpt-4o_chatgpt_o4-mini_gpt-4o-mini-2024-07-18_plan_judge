Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown organic compound. The following 1H NMR data was obtained:\n1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)\nIdentify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.', choice1='Trans-propenyl acetate', choice2='Cis-propenyl acetate', choice3='Cis-butenyl acetate', choice4='Trans-butenyl acetate', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_54
proposed answer: The large J=16 Hz coupling between vinyl protons indicates a trans double bond, and the methyl signals (acetyl singlet and allylic doublet) match propenyl acetate without extra methylene signals.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_54
proposed answer: The large 16 Hz coupling constant indicates a trans alkene, and the observed vinyl dq at 5.5 ppm, vinyl methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm, and acetate methyl singlet at 2.1 ppm uniquely match trans-propenyl acetate.
