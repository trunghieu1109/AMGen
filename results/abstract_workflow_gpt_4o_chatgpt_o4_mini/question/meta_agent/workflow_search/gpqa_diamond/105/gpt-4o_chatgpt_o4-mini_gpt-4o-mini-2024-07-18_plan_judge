Question: Example(question='The reaction between cyclohexanone and piperidine can result in the formation of a cyclic imine, also known as a Schiff base. This type of reaction is a classic example of imine formation, which involves the condensation of a ketone (cyclohexanone in this case) with a primary amine (piperidine) in the presence of an acid catalyst.\nWhat will be the favorable acid used (A) and the final product (B) of the following reaction?\nCyclohexanone + piperidine + (A, acrylaldehyde, H3O+) ---> B', choice1='A = TsOH, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal', choice2='A = HCl, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal', choice3='A = TsOH, B = 1-(2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexylidene)piperidin-1-ium', choice4='A = HCl, B = 1-(2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexylidene)piperidin-1-ium', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: p-Toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, organic-soluble acid that efficiently protonates the cyclohexanone carbonyl to promote enamine formation with piperidine. The enamine undergoes Michael addition to acrylaldehyde, and subsequent hydrolysis yields the Î³-ketoaldehyde 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal. HCl would protonate the amine and inhibit enamine formation.
