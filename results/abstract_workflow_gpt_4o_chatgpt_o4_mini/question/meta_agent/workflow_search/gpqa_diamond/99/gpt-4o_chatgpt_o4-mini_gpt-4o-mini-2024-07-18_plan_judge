Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_99
proposed answer: Based on sub-task evaluations: D gives two singlets (true), F is not used for dyes (statement false), H does not give yellow with FeCl3 (statement false), C is flammable gas (true). The incorrect statement identified in the original question corresponds to F being used for dye synthesis.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
