Example(question=&#39;Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.&#39;, choice1=&#39;D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.&#39;, choice2=&#39;F is used for the synthesis of dyes.&#39;, choice3=&#39;H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.&#39;, choice4=&#39;C is a flammable gas.&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 13: Select the incorrect statement about the products obtained in the reaction sequence based on the evaluations from previous subtasks. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent acx6:
Based on evaluations: D (propadiene) does not give two singlets; C (propyne) is a flammable gas; H gives no ferric chloride color; F (propane) is inert and not used in dye synthesis. Thus the incorrect statement is B).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KxZF:
Evaluations show compound F (propane) is not used in dye synthesis, so statement B is incorrect.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent UIoQ:
Based on the evaluations, compound F (propane) is inert and not used in dye synthesis, making statement B incorrect.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent mhMa:
Based on the subtask evaluations: D (propadiene) does not give two singlets; C (propyne) is a flammable gas; H (propane) yields no color with FeCl3; only statement B is incorrect since propane is not used in dye synthesis.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent acx6:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent KxZF:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent UIoQ:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent mhMa:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 13: Make final decision on incorrect statement.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
