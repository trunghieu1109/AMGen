Of the C3H6 isomers, only propene (CH3–CH=CH2) fits this behavior; cyclopropane would not readily add Br2 under these conditions.; answer: A is propene (CH3–CH=CH2). It is a colorless, flammable gas (bp –47.7°C, MW 42.08 g/mol) featuring a C=C double bond. The double-bonded carbons are sp2-hybridized, planar, and undergo electrophilic addition, polymerization, and typical alkene reactions.\nCoT agent WbRY, determining compound B, thinking: Propene (CH2=CH–CH3) adds Br2 across the double bond in CCl4 to yield a vicinal dibromide via electrophilic addition, giving 1,2-dibromopropane.; answer: Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3–CHBr–CH2Br).\nCoT agent QzfO, identifying compound C, thinking: Compound B is 1,2‐dibromopropane. Treatment with alcoholic KOH induces two consecutive dehydrohalogenations of the vicinal dibromide, yielding the corresponding alkyne. That alkyne is propyne (methylacetylene).; answer: Propyne (methylacetylene), CH₃–C≡CH.\nCoT agent Ooz0, determining compound D, thinking: Compound C is propyne (CH₃–C≡CH). Passing a terminal alkyne through a red-hot iron tube induces cyclotrimerization, yielding 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene).; answer: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)\nCoT agent boXR, identifying compound E, thinking: Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene).
