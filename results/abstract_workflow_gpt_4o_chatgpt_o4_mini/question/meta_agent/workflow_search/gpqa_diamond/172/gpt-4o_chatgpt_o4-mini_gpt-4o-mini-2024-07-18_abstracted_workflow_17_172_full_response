Differentiating gives ΔE ≈ (dE/dp)Δp = (p/m)Δp. Since v = p/m, ΔE ≈ v·Δp.; answer: ΔE ≈ (p/m)·Δp = v·Δp\nCoT-SC agent 753w, determining relationship between Δp and ΔE, thinking: The kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m = v. Thus small changes give ΔE ≈ (p/m)Δp = v\u2009Δp.; answer: ΔE ≈ v\u2009Δp\nCoT-SC agent 7m0s, determining relationship between Δp and ΔE, thinking: To relate Δp to ΔE for an electron, use the energy–momentum relation E(p).
