Example(question=&#34;If uncertainty in space of electron&#39;s location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.&#34;, choice1=&#39;~10^(-19) J&#39;, choice2=&#39;~10^(-18) J&#39;, choice3=&#39;~10^(-16) J&#39;, choice4=&#39;~10^(-17) J&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated ΔE with the given choices to select the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent MgwA:
The calculated ΔE ≈1×10⁻¹⁶ J matches choice C.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent J6XF:
The calculated ΔE is approximately 1×10⁻¹⁶ J, which corresponds to choice C.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent qdOF:
Using Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.05×10⁻³⁴ Js / (2×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 5.25×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s and ΔE ≈ vΔp ≈ 2×10⁸ m/s × 5.25×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s ≈ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J, which corresponds to choice C).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent HK5A:
We computed ΔE ≈1×10⁻¹⁶ J, which matches choice C).

### answer #3 by Debate Agent MgwA:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent J6XF:
C)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent qdOF:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
