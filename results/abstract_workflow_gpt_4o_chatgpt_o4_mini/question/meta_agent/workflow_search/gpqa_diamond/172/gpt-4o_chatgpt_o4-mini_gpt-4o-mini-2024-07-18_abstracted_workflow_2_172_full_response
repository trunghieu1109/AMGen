Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10^-10 m and ħ ≈ 1.054×10^-34 J·s, we get Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) ≈ 1.054×10^-34/(2×1×10^-10) ≈ 5.27×10^-25 kg·m/s.; answer: ≈5.3×10^-25 kg·m/s\nCoT-SC agent 5k2q, converting momentum to energy, thinking: For a relativistic particle E^2=(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2 and dE/dp=pc^2/E=v. Thus ΔE≈vΔp with v=2×10^8\u2009m/s and Δp≈5.3×10^−25\u2009kg·m/s gives ΔE≈(2×10^8)(5.3×10^−25)≈1.06×10^−16\u2009J, near 10^−16\u2009J.; answer: C)\nCoT-SC agent U33Y, converting momentum to energy, thinking: To convert Δp to ΔE for a relativistic particle use ΔE≈(pc²/E)Δp, but pc²/E=v, so ΔE≈v·Δp=2×10⁸\u2009m/s·5.3×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s≈1.06×10⁻¹⁶\u2009J.; answer: ≈1×10⁻¹⁶ J\nCoT-SC agent f6Iq, converting momentum to energy, thinking: We use the relativistic energy–momentum relation E²=(pc)²+(mc²)². For small momentum uncertainty, ΔE ≈ (pc²/E)Δp. An electron with v=2×10⁸ m/s has β=0.667, γ=1/√(1−β²)≈1.341, so p=γmv≈1.341·9.11×10⁻³¹·2×10⁸≈2.45×10⁻²² kg·m/s and E=γmc²≈1.341·9.11×10⁻³¹·(3×10⁸)²≈1.10×10⁻¹³ J.
