Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_87
proposed answer: Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes within germinal center B cells, such as those in Peyer’s patches, leading to high variability. The observed high mutation rate in the V-heavy chain genes of proliferating Peyer’s patch B cells directly reflects this process, confirming alignment with the experimental context of affinity maturation in gut‐associated lymphoid tissue.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_87
proposed answer: High variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating Peyer’s patch B cells arises from antigen-driven point mutations introduced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase during germinal center reactions, which defines somatic hypermutation.
