Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_100
proposed answer: Sub-task 4 identified A as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde; Sub-task 5 determined B as TsOH. Matching these to the provided options gives choice 2, which is option B).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_100
proposed answer: Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde undergoes efficient acid-catalyzed condensation with the amine to give the imine, and TsOH is a strong acid that promotes both nucleophilic addition and dehydration steps.
