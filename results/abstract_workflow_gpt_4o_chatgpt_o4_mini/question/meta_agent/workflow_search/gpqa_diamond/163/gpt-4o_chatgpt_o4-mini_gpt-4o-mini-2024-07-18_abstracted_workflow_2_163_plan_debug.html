    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 0.4&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 0.7&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1.2&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Compare the total masses of system_1 and system_2 derived in subtasks 3 and 4 to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent dkok:
Total masses: system_1 ≈0.25 M⊙, system_2 ≈0.60 M⊙; ratio 0.25/0.60 ≈0.42 ≈0.4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent IqI3:
Subtask 3 gives total mass of system_1 ≈ 0.25 M⊙; subtask 4 gives total mass of system_2 ≈ 0.60 M⊙. Their ratio is 0.25/0.60 ≈ 0.42 ≈ 0.4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent QmiS:
Total mass of system_1 ≈0.25 M⊙ and system_2 ≈0.60 M⊙, so the ratio is 0.25/0.60 ≈0.42 ≈0.4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent oZ4M:
Total masses from subtasks are ≈0.25 M⊙ and ≈0.60 M⊙, so the ratio 0.25/0.60 ≈0.42 ≈0.4.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
