    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 0.4&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 0.7&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1.2&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Compare the masses of system_1 and system_2 to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent eFhD:
We have M1≈0.25 M⊙ and M2≈0.6 M⊙ from sub‐tasks 1 and 2. Taking the ratio gives M1/M2≈0.25/0.6≈0.42, rounded to ≈0.4 under the circular, edge‐on assumptions.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent eFhD:
≈0.4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Select the correct choice from the given options based on the calculated factor.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
