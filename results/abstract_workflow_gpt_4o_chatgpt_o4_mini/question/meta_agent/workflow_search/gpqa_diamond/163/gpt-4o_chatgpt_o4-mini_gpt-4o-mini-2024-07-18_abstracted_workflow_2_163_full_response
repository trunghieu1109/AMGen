For an eclipsing binary (sin i≈1): M₁=f(m)·(1+q)²/q³=0.075·9/8≈0.0844 M⊙, M₂=q·M₁≈0.1688 M⊙.

The formula M₁=f(m)·(1+q)²/q³ is used properly, yielding M₁≈0.0844 M⊙, M₂≈0.1688 M⊙, and total ≈0.253 M⊙. Just ensure that f(m) was computed with the correct period and units, and note that sin i is close to but not exactly 1 for real eclipsing systems.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent mECe, refining total mass of system_1, thinking: We use the mass function f(m)=0.075\u2009M⊙ and the mass ratio q=K₁/K₂=10/5=2.

Solving M₂=qM₁ in the mass function gives M₁=(1+q)²·f(m)/q³=0.075·9/8≈0.0844 M⊙, M₂≈0.1688 M⊙, so the total mass M₁+M₂≈0.253 M⊙, rounded to ≈0.25 M⊙.; answer: Total mass of system_1 ≈ 0.25 M⊙\nReflexion CoT agent VzTY, deriving total mass of system_2, thinking: To derive the total mass M1+M2 from the mass function f(M) we need the mass ratio q=M2/M1 (given by K1/K2=15/10=1.5) and assume sin i≈1. The mass function f1=(M2^3)/(M1+M2)^2≈0.13\u2009M⊙. Substituting M2=1.5M1 and solving gives M1≈0.24\u2009M⊙ and M2≈0.36\u2009M⊙, so M1+M2≈0.6\u2009M⊙.

Solving (M₂³)/(M₁+M₂)² = f₁ yields M₁ ≈ 0.24 M☉ and M₂ ≈ 0.36 M☉, so M₁+M₂ ≈ 0.6 M☉.

The mass ratio q = K₁/K₂ = 1.5, so M₂ = 1.5\u2009M₁. Solving M₂³/(M₁+M₂)² = f₁ ≈ 0.13\u2009M⊙ gives M₁ ≈ 0.24\u2009M⊙ and M₂ ≈ 0.36\u2009M⊙, hence M₁ + M₂ ≈ 0.6\u2009M⊙.

Assuming a circular orbit and sin\u2009i ≃ 1, one obtains M1 ≃ 0.24\u2009M⊙, M2 ≃ 0.36\u2009M⊙, and Mtot ≃ 0.60\u2009M⊙.

The quoted f₁≈0.13 M⊙ appears reasonable for K₁=15 km/s and P=1 yr, but spelling out those steps and confirming inclination is needed for clarity. Also, stating the mass ratio q=K₁/K₂ explicitly before solving would improve transparency.; answer: M₁+M₂ ≈ 0.60 M☉\nReflexion CoT agent VzTY, refining total mass of system_2, thinking: To derive M_total: use the mass function f₁=(P·K₁³)/(2πG) with P=1\u2009yr and K₁=15\u2009km/s giving f₁≈0.13\u2009M⊙.
