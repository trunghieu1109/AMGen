Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_162
proposed answer: The calculated acid volume (~28.08 cm³) matches choice A’s 28.05 cm³, and despite the pH discrepancy likely arising from ambiguity about whether the acid volume is included in the final 100 cm³, A) remains the closest match.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_17_162
proposed answer: The calculated pH of 2.69 and required acid volume of ~30.09 cm3 match choice2, which corresponds to option B).
