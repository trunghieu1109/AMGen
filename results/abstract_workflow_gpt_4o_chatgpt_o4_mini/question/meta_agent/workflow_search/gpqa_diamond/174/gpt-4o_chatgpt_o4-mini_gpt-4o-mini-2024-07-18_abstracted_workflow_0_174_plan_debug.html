    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, choice1=&#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, choice2=&#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, choice3=&#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, choice4=&#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;, correct_index=1).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
