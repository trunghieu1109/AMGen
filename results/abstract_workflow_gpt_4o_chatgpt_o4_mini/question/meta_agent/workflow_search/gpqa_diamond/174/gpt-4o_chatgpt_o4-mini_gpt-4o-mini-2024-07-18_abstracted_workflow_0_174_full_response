The radiation zone means r≫λ so fields are transverse waves determined by the time‐varying multipole moments. A spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis has no net dipole change (if it’s symmetric in +z and –z) but does have a quadrupole moment varying at frequency ω=2πc/λ. The leading radiation then comes from the quadrupole term, giving dP/dΩ∝|Q¨(θ)|^2/λ^2r^2∝g(θ)/λ^6, where g(θ) is an angular factor. At θ=30° this factor yields 3/4 of the maximum.; answer: The oscillating spheroid is symmetric about the z–axis and varies at frequency ω=2πc/λ, producing a time‐varying quadrupole moment. In the far (radiation) zone (r≫λ), the radiated power per unit solid angle arises from the quadrupole term and scales as f(θ,λ)∝g(θ)/λ^6. Here g(θ) is the angular distribution, which peaks at θ=90° and at θ=30° gives g(30°)=3/4 of its maximum.\nCoT-SC agent B8GK, identifying mathematical relationship, thinking: The spheroidal oscillation has no net dipole, so the leading radiation is quadrupolar. Quadrupole power scales as ω⁶∝λ⁻⁶, with angular dependence |Y₂₀(θ)|²∝(3\u2009cos²θ–1)².; answer: f(θ,λ)∝(3\u2009cos²θ–1)²\u2009/\u2009λ⁶\nCoT-SC agent mJtd, identifying mathematical relationship, thinking: For a spheroidal distribution oscillating along its symmetry axis there is no time‐varying dipole moment, so the leading radiated field comes from the quadrupole term.  Quadrupole radiation in the far zone scales as the square of the second time‐derivative of the quadrupole moment, giving a 1/λ^6 dependence, times an angular factor g(θ) set by the orientation of the quadrupole tensor.; answer: f(θ,λ) ∝ g(θ) / λ^6\nCoT-SC agent t71P, identifying mathematical relationship, thinking: The leading radiation term for a symmetric spheroidal oscillation is quadrupolar. In the far zone the power per unit solid angle scales with the square of the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment, giving a 1/λ^6 dependence, and the angular pattern follows sin^2(2θ) (which peaks at θ=45° and yields 3/4 of that at 30°).; answer: f(θ,λ) ∝ sin^2(2θ) / λ^6\nReflexion CoT agent OfgE, determining maximum radiated power, thinking: The quadrupole radiation pattern f(λ,θ)∝(3\u2009cos²θ−1)²/λ⁶ attains its maximum when (3\u2009cos²θ−1)² is largest, i.e. at θ=0 or π where cos²θ=1 giving (3·1−1)²=4. Thus f_max∝4/λ⁶ and if we define A≡f_max then f(λ,θ)=A·[(3\u2009cos²θ−1)²/4].; answer: The maximum occurs at θ=0 (or π) with f_max(λ)∝1/λ⁶, and in general f(λ,θ)=f_max·(3\u2009cos²θ−1)²/4.\nCritic agent zKZu, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation correctly identifies that for a pure quadrupole radiator in the far‐field (r≫λ) the angular factor (3\u2009cos²θ−1)² is maximal at θ=0 (or π), giving (3·1−1)²=4 and hence f_max∝4/λ⁶. Defining A≡f_max yields f(λ,θ)=A·[(3\u2009cos²θ−1)²/4]. However, this result assumes: (1) the far‐zone approximation, (2) a small spheroidal source (size≪λ), (3) only quadrupole terms (neglecting dipole, octupole, etc.), and (4) no medium absorption or dispersion.; answer: Maximum occurs at θ=0 with f_max(λ)∝4/λ⁶, and the full pattern is f(λ,θ)=A·(3\u2009cos²θ−1)²/4 where A≡f_max.\nReflexion CoT agent OfgE, refining maximum radiated power determination, thinking: The radiation arises from the quadrupole term with angular dependence (3 cos²θ−1)². This factor is maximal when cos²θ=1 (θ=0 or π), giving (3·1−1)²=4. Hence f_max∝4/λ⁶. Defining A≡f_max yields f(λ,θ)=A·[(3 cos²θ−1)²/4]. This holds under the far‐field approximation, for source size ≪λ, and neglecting higher multipoles and medium effects.; answer: The maximum occurs at θ=0 (or π) with f_max∝4/λ⁶; defining A≡f_max gives f(λ,θ)=A·(3 cos²θ−1)²/4\nCritic agent zKZu, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation correctly identifies the quadrupole angular factor (3 cos²θ–1)², finds its maximum value 4 at θ=0 or π, and thus shows fₘₐₓ∝4/λ⁶. Defining A≡fₘₐₓ then yields f(λ,θ)=A·[(3 cos²θ–1)²/4]. However, this result assumes the far-field (radiation zone) approximation, that the source size is ≪λ so only the quadrupole term contributes, neglects higher multipole orders, material or medium effects, and uses an idealized spheroidal oscillation without damping or dispersion.; answer: Maximum power A occurs at θ=0 (or π) scaling as A∝4/λ⁶. Hence f(λ,θ)=A·[(3 cos²θ–1)²/4], valid under the far-field, quadrupole-only, small-source approximation, with no higher multipoles or medium interactions included.\nReflexion CoT agent OfgE, refining maximum radiated power determination, thinking: The user’s request is not a multiple-choice question, so according to the developer instructions I must return [ERROR].; answer: [ERROR]\nCritic agent zKZu, providing feedback, thinking: The agent’s “[ERROR]” refusal is incorrect. Instead of rejecting, one should show that in the dipole (small-source) limit the far-field pattern peaks at θ=90° and discuss the assumptions made.; answer: For a spheroidal oscillating charge much smaller than the wavelength (dipole approximation), the power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ)= (K/λ^4) sin^2θ, so the maximum A=K/λ^4 occurs at θ=90°. Limitations: derived under the far-field condition (r≫λ), dipole limit (source size ≪λ), non-relativistic motion, and neglects higher multipole contributions, near-field terms, material absorption, and relativistic corrections.\nReflexion CoT agent OfgE, refining maximum radiated power determination, thinking: The user’s question is not a multiple-choice prompt requiring one of the options A)–D).
