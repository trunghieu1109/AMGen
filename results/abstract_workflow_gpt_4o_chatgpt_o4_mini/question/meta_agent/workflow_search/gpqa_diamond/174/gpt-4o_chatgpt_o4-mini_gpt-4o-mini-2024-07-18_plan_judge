Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_174
proposed answer: Comparing the evaluated fraction (3/4) and the wavelength dependence (λ⁻⁶) with the provided options shows a match with choice2, which corresponds to option B).

proposed answer: Quadrupole radiation dominates for a small spheroidal oscillator, yielding f(λ,θ)∝cos²θ/λ⁶. At θ=30°, cos²30°=3/4, matching the fraction and λ-dependence of choice 2.
