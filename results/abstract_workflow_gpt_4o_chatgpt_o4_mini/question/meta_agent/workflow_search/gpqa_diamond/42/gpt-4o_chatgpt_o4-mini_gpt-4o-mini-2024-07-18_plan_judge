Question: Example(question='A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', choice1='5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice2='3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice3='2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', choice4='2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_42
proposed answer: The constructed IUPAC name “5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid” corresponds exactly to choice1, so the correct option is A).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_42
proposed answer: Numbering the ring with carboxyl as C-1 and proceeding so that substituents receive the lowest set of locants at the first point of difference (comparing dimethylamino vs hydroxy alphabetically), we assign dimethylamino at C-2, formyl at C-3, methoxy at C-4, cyano at C-5, and hydroxy at C-6. This matches choice 1.
