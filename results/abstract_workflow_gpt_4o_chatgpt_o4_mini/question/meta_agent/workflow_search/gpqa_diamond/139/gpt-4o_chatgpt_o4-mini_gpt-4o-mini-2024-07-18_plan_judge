Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_139
proposed answer: Substance X is LiAlD4, containing 4 deuterium atoms (isotope of hydrogen, mass ≈2.0141 u each) and one aluminum atom (mass ≈26.9815 u). Summing the masses of all deuteriums gives 4×2.0141≈8.0564 u. The single aluminum atom contributes ≈26.9815 u.

Answer:Lightest (deuterium) cumulative mass ≈8.056 u; Heaviest (aluminum) cumulative mass ≈26.982 u.
Extracted answer: Lightest (deuterium) cumulative mass ≈8.056 u; Heaviest (aluminum) cumulative mass ≈26.982 u.
Correct answer: 2
