    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.&#39;, choice1=&#39;29&#39;, choice2=&#39;25&#39;, choice3=&#39;35&#39;, choice4=&#39;31&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify Substance X and its constituent elements, focusing on the heavier isotope mentioned. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent p7KS:
Substance X reacts with alkali metal to give deuteride gas D2 (each D has 1 p + 1 n → D2 has 2 p + 2 n), precipitate NaOD gives D2O on heating (mp ≈277 K). So X is heavy water.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent p7KS:
Substance X is heavy water (D2O), composed of deuterium and oxygen.

### Sub-task 6: Identify the very close analog of Substance X used as a reagent in organic chemistry. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent bQ9W:
Substance X is heavy water (D2O). Its very close analog used as a reagent in organic chemistry is ordinary water (H2O).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bQ9W:
H2O

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, considering all isotopes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
