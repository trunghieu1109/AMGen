    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?&#39;, choice1=&#39;C2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C2v&#39;, choice3=&#39;D4h&#39;, choice4=&#39;D∞h&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the identity of product E. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent k4GX:
All debate agents consistently identified product E as the vicinal dibromide formed from Br₂ and C₂H₄, namely 1,2-dibromoethane.

### answer by Final Decision Agent k4GX:
1,2-dibromoethane

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Analyze the molecular structure of product E to determine its symmetry group.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
