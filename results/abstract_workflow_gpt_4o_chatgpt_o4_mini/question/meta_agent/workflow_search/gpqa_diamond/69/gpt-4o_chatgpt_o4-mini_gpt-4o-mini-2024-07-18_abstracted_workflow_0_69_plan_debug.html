F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?&#39;, choice1=&#39;C2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C2v&#39;, choice3=&#39;D4h&#39;, choice4=&#39;D∞h&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on structure of E. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent PrR1:
The reaction stoichiometry C + 2D → E and absence of molecular formulas, functional groups or spectroscopic data means any detailed structure is speculative. The most consistent inference is that E is a bis-adduct with two D moieties attached to C, yielding a symmetrical di-substituted core.

### answer by Final Decision Agent PrR1:
E is likely a symmetrical bis-adduct in which two D units are covalently bonded to the reactive centers of C, forming a D–C–D di-substituted core.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the molecular formulas or structural details of C and D to enable precise elucidation of E’s structure.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Identify the molecular symmetry group of E based on its structure.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Given that E is described as a symmetrical bis-adduct (two identical D units attached to C), the molecule should possess a C2 rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, which corresponds to the C2v point group. However, without explicit molecular formulas or structural details of C and D, this assignment remains tentative.

Answer:C2v
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the molecular formulas or structural details of C and D to confirm the symmetry.</pre>
