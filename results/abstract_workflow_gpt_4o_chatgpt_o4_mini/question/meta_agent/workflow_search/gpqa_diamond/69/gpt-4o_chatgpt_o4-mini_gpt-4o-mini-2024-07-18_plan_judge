Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_69
proposed answer: Given that E is described as a symmetrical bis-adduct (two identical D units attached to C), the molecule should possess a C2 rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, which corresponds to the C2v point group. However, without explicit molecular formulas or structural details of C and D, this assignment remains tentative.

Answer:C2v
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the molecular formulas or structural details of C and D to confirm the symmetry.
Extracted answer: C2v

proposed answer: Product E is 1,2-dibromoethane in its most stable staggered conformation. The only nontrivial symmetry element is a C2 axis through the C–C bond, giving point group C2.
