    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’&lt;b&gt;&#39;, choice1=&#39;Mutant 2&#39;, choice2=&#39;Mutant 4&#39;, choice3=&#39;Mutant 1&#39;, choice4=&#39;Mutant 3&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Apply knowledge of genetic mutations and their effects to predict which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ko5x:
Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) early in the first exon, causing truncation of the enzyme and abolishing its activity, which will prevent synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent YBxV:
Mutant 2 changes the third codon to a premature stop (TAA), causing early truncation of the enzyme and abolishing its activity, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent MqKR:
Mutant 2 creates a premature stop codon (TAA) in the third codon of the first exon, leading to early truncation of the enzyme and loss of function, which prevents synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ZPNK:
Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at the third codon, leading to early truncation of the enzyme and loss of its function, thus preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent ko5x:
A)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent YBxV:
A)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent MqKR:
A)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent ZPNK:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on mutation effect.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
