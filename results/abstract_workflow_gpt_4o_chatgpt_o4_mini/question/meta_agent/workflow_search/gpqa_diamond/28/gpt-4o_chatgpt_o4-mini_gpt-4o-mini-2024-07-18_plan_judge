Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_28
proposed answer: Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) in the third codon, leading to early truncation and loss of function, preventing synthesis of the compound.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_28
proposed answer: Mutant 1 causes only a single conservative amino‐acid change near the N-terminus, making it the mildest alteration and thus the most likely to disrupt the unwanted activity while preserving essential functions. However, without domain mapping or targeted functional assays, this selection remains speculative, warranting a [TOO_HARD] flag.

Answer:C)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide domain mapping or functional assay data to identify residues uniquely required for anti-nutritional compound synthesis.
