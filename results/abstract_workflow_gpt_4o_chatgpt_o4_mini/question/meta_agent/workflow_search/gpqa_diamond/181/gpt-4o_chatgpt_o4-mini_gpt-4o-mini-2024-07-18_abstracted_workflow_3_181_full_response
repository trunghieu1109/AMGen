Choices B, C, and D each violate at least one requirement (negligible drift vs. diffusion, two carriers, Schottky barrier).; answer: A)\nCoT-SC agent 6yRk, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law requires a trap-free, single-carrier device with ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and negligible diffusion current. Choice A exactly states these conditions. Choice B incorrectly mentions negligible drift current. Choice C involves two carriers, violating single-carrier assumption. Choice D specifies a Schottky contact, implying an injection barrier.; answer: A)\nCoT-SC agent JIMF, thinking: We compare each choice to the trap-free, single-carrier, ohmic injection, negligible diffusion conditions of the Mott–Gurney law.\n– A: Trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic), negligible diffusion. Matches exactly.\n– B: Ohmic contact is correct, but states negligible drift current; however SCLC is drift‐dominated, so B is invalid.\n– C: Involves two carriers; Mott–Gurney applies to single‐carrier only, so C is invalid.\n– D: Schottky contact implies an injection barrier, violating Ohmic injection requirement, so D is invalid.; answer: A)\nReflexion CoT agent uYrY, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law is derived for space‐charge‐limited current in a trap‐free, single‐carrier device with ohmic injection (no barrier) and negligible diffusion current. Choice1 exactly matches these conditions, so the equation is valid.; answer: Yes\nCritic agent tl1Z, thinking: The evaluation is correct.

Choice1 matches these conditions exactly, so the equation is valid under those assumptions.; answer: Yes\nCritic agent tl1Z, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that the Mott–Gurney equation applies under the stated trap-free, single-carrier, ohmic injection, and negligible diffusion conditions. Choice1 is indeed valid.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent uYrY, refining evaluation, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation is derived for space‐charge‐limited current in a trap‐free, single‐carrier device with ohmic injection (no barrier) and negligible diffusion current, exactly matching the conditions in choice1.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent ByXb, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law applies to space‐charge‐limited current where drift current dominates and diffusion is negligible. Choice2’s assumption of negligible drift current directly contradicts this requirement, so the equation is not valid under those conditions.; answer: The equation is not valid for choice2.\nCritic agent 9AJ2, thinking: The evaluation is solid: the Mott–Gurney law describes space‐charge‐limited current dominated by drift with negligible diffusion, so assuming negligible drift directly contradicts the law’s conditions. Hence concluding the equation is not valid for choice2 is correct.; answer: The evaluation is correct.\nReflexion CoT agent ByXb, refining evaluation, thinking: Choice2 assumes negligible drift current, which contradicts the drift‐dominated nature of space‐charge‐limited current in the Mott–Gurney regime. Therefore the equation is not valid under those conditions.; answer: The equation is not valid for choice2.\nCritic agent 9AJ2, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that space-charge-limited current is drift-dominated, so assuming negligible drift current contradicts the regime where the Mott–Gurney equation applies.; answer: The Mott–Gurney equation is not valid for choice2.\nReflexion CoT agent ByXb, refining evaluation, thinking: Choice2 assumes negligible drift current, but space-charge-limited current under the Mott–Gurney law is drift-dominated with negligible diffusion. This contradiction means the equation does not apply under those conditions.; answer: The equation is not valid for choice2.\nCritic agent 9AJ2, thinking: The evaluation correctly points out that the Mott–Gurney law describes a drift-dominated SCLC regime and thus cannot assume negligible drift current, so choice2 is invalid.; answer: The equation is not valid for choice2.\nReflexion CoT agent ByXb, refining evaluation, thinking: Choice2 assumes negligible drift current, which contradicts the drift‐dominated nature of space‐charge‐limited current described by the Mott–Gurney law. Therefore the equation is not valid under those conditions.; answer: The equation is not valid for choice2.\nReflexion CoT agent rGXS, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device; introducing both electrons and holes changes the space-charge distribution and current dynamics, violating the single-carrier assumption.

The chain-of-thought justification is sound.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent rGXS, refining evaluation, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device with Ohmic injection and negligible diffusion. Introducing both electrons and holes violates the single-carrier assumption, so it does not apply to a two-carrier device.; answer: No\nCritic agent jMkC, thinking: The evaluation correctly notes that the Mott–Gurney equation requires a trap-free, single‐carrier device with Ohmic injection and negligible diffusion, so it does not apply to a two‐carrier device.; answer: No\nReflexion CoT agent rGXS, refining evaluation, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation requires a trap-free, single-carrier device with Ohmic injection and negligible diffusion.

Thus the Mott–Gurney law does not apply under these conditions.; answer: Not valid\nCritic agent JnVI, thinking: The evaluation is accurate. A Schottky contact introduces an injection barrier, so the Mott–Gurney law’s requirement for Ohmic injection is violated and the equation does not apply.; answer: Correct\nReflexion CoT agent o83C, refining evaluation, thinking: Choice 4 specifies a Schottky contact which introduces an injection barrier, violating the requirement for ohmic injection. Therefore, the Mott–Gurney equation is not valid in this case.; answer: [ERROR]\nCritic agent JnVI, thinking: The evaluation correctly notes that a Schottky contact introduces an injection barrier, violating the ohmic injection assumption required for the Mott–Gurney law. Therefore choice 4 is indeed invalid.; answer: Choice 4 is not valid because the presence of a Schottky contact prevents the ohmic injection needed for the Mott–Gurney equation.\nReflexion CoT agent o83C, refining evaluation, thinking: Choice 4 specifies a Schottky contact which introduces an injection barrier, violating the requirement for Ohmic injection. Therefore, the Mott–Gurney equation is not valid under these conditions.; answer: [ERROR]\nCritic agent JnVI, thinking: The evaluation is correct.
