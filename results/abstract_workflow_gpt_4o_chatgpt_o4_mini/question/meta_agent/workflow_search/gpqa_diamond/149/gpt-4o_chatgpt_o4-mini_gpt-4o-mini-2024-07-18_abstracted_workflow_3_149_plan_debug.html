Example(question=&#39;A compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and the given NMR data is reacted with the following set of reagents:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl\n2. H2O\n3. aq. KOH, Heat \n\n1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Identify the final product.&#39;, choice1=&#39;4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal&#39;, choice2=&#39;3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal&#39;, choice3=&#39;2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal&#39;, choice4=&#39;2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the final product. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 8pXu:
Under strongly basic, heated conditions, a symmetric dialdehyde hydrate undergoes a Cannizzaro disproportionation yielding one hydroxymethyl and one carboxylate substituent. Without defined stoichiometry or workup, the most plausible isolated product is 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzoic acid, but the exact form (free acid vs. salt) depends on workup.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 8pXu:
4-(hydroxymethyl)benzoic acid
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify reaction stoichiometry, intramolecular vs. intermolecular pathway, and workup conditions to determine the isolated form.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the predicted final product with the given choices and identify the correct one.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
