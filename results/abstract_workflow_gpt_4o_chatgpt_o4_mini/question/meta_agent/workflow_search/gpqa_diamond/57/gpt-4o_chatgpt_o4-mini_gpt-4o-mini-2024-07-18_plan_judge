proposed answer: I reviewed standard references (Green–Schwarz–Witten; Polchinski; Zwiebach) and expert reviews which show that perturbative superstring amplitudes are UV‐finite thanks to the extended nature of strings and modular invariance, whereas QED and QCD require renormalization and classical electrodynamics suffers self‐energy divergences. However, these results hold under specific assumptions and loop orders.

Answer:Perturbative superstring theory is generally regarded as UV‐finite and not requiring high‐energy regularization, in contrast to QED, QCD, and classical electrodynamics. Limitations: 1) Finiteness is proven order by order in the genus (perturbative) expansion, not nonperturbatively. 2) Results assume critical (10D) superstring backgrounds with supersymmetry and GSO projection. 3) Off‐shell quantities and string field theory formulations can still exhibit divergences. 4) Noncritical or bosonic string models face tachyonic/UV issues. 5) A complete nonperturbative definition (e.g. M-theory) with guaranteed finiteness remains lacking.

proposed answer: All analyses agree that Superstring Theory is ultraviolet finite and inherently provides a high-energy cutoff, so it never requires regularization.
