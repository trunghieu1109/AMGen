        "response": "I reviewed standard references (Green\u2013Schwarz\u2013Witten; Polchinski; Zwiebach) and expert reviews which show that perturbative superstring amplitudes are UV\u2010finite thanks to the extended nature of strings and modular invariance, whereas QED and QCD require renormalization and classical electrodynamics suffers self\u2010energy divergences. However, these results hold under specific assumptions and loop orders.\n\nAnswer:Perturbative superstring theory is generally regarded as UV\u2010finite and not requiring high\u2010energy regularization, in contrast to QED, QCD, and classical electrodynamics. Limitations: 1) Finiteness is proven order by order in the genus (perturbative) expansion, not nonperturbatively. 2) Results assume critical (10D) superstring backgrounds with supersymmetry and GSO projection. 3) Off\u2010shell quantities and string field theory formulations can still exhibit divergences. 4) Noncritical or bosonic string models face tachyonic/UV issues. 5) A complete nonperturbative definition (e.g. M-theory) with guaranteed finiteness remains lacking.",
