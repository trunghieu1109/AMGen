This yields 4 detectable stars. However, precise S/N estimates depend on observing mode, atmospheric conditions, and detector behavior, which are unspecified.\n\nAnswer:4\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the ESPRESSO observing mode (e.g., 1-UT high-resolution vs. 4-UT), assumed atmospheric conditions (seeing, airmass), and detector linearity/saturation limits to refine these detectability estimates.",
