I then summarize how these impact S/N scaling with magnitude, exposure time, and telescope aperture.; answer: ESPRESSO operates in three modes: singleHR (R≈140 000), singleUHR (R≈200 000), and multiMR (R≈70 000) over 380–788 nm. Total throughput (atmosphere\u2009+\u2009telescope\u2009+\u2009instrument) peaks at ≈15%. On one 8.2 m UT in HR mode, it reaches S/N≈10 per binned pixel in a 1 h exposure for V≈14.0\u2009mag stars; in combined 4-UT mode, S/N≈10 is reached at V≈16\u2009mag. S/N scales approximately ∝√(t_exp) and ∝10^(−0.2·ΔV). The instrument’s thermal and pressure stabilization yields RV stability <10 cm/s, but for S/N estimates the key drivers are collecting area, throughput, resolution (which sets pixel size), and detector noise, all folded into the limiting-magnitude curves provided in the ESPRESSO User Manual.\nCoT agent w6nf, calculating apparent magnitude, thinking: To get each star’s apparent magnitude m, use the distance-modulus formula m = M + 5·log10(d/10 pc).
