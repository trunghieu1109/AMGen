Example(question=&#39;How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;3&#39;, choice3=&#39;2&#39;, choice4=&#39;5&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on detectability. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 2YlJ:
We compare the S/N values obtained for each star to the threshold of 10: stars a (≈9100), b (≈2500), and e (≈12.6) meet or exceed the threshold, while c, d, and f do not. That yields 3 detectable stars.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 2YlJ:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Count the number of stars that meet or exceed the S/N threshold of 10.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
