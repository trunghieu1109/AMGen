Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_66
proposed answer: Since m1+m2 = -1 + -1 = -2 ≠ m = -1, the corresponding Clebsch–Gordan coefficient vanishes, giving joint probability zero, which matches choice C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_17_66
proposed answer: The Clebsch–Gordan coefficient for (m1,m2)=(-1,-1) is zero, so the probability amplitude is 0; squaring gives probability 0.
