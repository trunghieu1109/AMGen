This is straightforward and doesn’t require additional information.; answer: The state |1,1,2,-1> is the coupled orbital angular momentum basis for two electrons, each in a p‐orbital (l₁=1, l₂=1), combined to total orbital angular momentum L=2 with projection M=−1.\nCoT-SC agent zTf5, determining possible L_1z and L_2z values, thinking: To get total M = m1 + m2 = -1 with m1,m2 ∈ {−1,0,1}, the only solutions are (m1,m2) = (−1,0) or (0,−1).; answer: The possible values of (L1z,L2z) are (−ħ, 0) and (0, −ħ).\nCoT-SC agent aHsy, determining possible L_1z and L_2z values, thinking: We need m1+m2 = M = -1 with m1,m2∈{-1,0,1}.

The combination m1=m2=-1 gives M=-2, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero.; answer: 0\nCritic agent XL7u, providing feedback, thinking: The amplitude is correctly identified as zero. Since m1 + m2 must equal M = -1, the pair (-1, -1) sums to -2 and thus has a vanishing Clebsch–Gordan coefficient.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent LqsG, refining probability amplitude, thinking: For total M = -1 with l1 = l2 = 1, the pair (m1, m2) = (-1, -1) yields M = -2, not -1, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient vanishes.; answer: 0\nCritic agent XL7u, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation is correct. For l1=l2=1 and total m=−1, the only contributions come from m1+m2=−1.
