Example(question=&#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;1&#39;, choice2=&#39;1/2&#39;, choice3=&#39;0&#39;, choice4=&#39;2/3&#39;, correct_index=2).

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent amRc:
The Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1,−1;1,−1|2,−1⟩ vanishes since m₁+m₂≠m, yielding probability 0, which corresponds to choice C.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent b14c:
Since m₁ + m₂ = -2 ≠ m = -1, the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1,−1;1,−1|2,−1⟩ vanishes, giving joint probability zero, which corresponds to choice C).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent qwKM:
The Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1,−1;1,−1|2,−1⟩ vanishes because m₁+m₂=−2≠−1, so the joint probability is 0, which corresponds to choice C.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 7qyx:
Since the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1,−1;1,−1|2,−1⟩ vanishes (m₁+m₂=−2≠m=−1), the joint probability is 0, corresponding to choice C.
