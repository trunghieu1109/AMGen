        "response": "To develop a real-time PCR kit you need: a validated primer/probe set, optimized master mix, controls, cycling protocol, and validation data. However, without the exact viral cDNA sequence or gene coordinates you cannot finalize probe design or optimize assay conditions precisely.\n\nAnswer:1. Assemble qPCR master mix: DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl\u2082, buffer.\n2. Add designed primers (200\u2013500 nM) and TaqMan probe (100\u2013250 nM).\n3. Include controls: positive (known viral cDNA), negative (no template), and internal amplification control.\n4. Set thermal cycling: 95 \u00b0C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, recording fluorescence each cycle.\n5. Generate a standard curve with serial dilutions to determine limit of detection and efficiency.\n6. Test specificity against related viruses and host nucleic acids.\n7. Lyophilize or aliquot reagents, provide clear instructions, and package with controls.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the exact viral cDNA target sequence or precise gene coordinates so that the primer/probe sequences and assay parameters can be finalized.",
