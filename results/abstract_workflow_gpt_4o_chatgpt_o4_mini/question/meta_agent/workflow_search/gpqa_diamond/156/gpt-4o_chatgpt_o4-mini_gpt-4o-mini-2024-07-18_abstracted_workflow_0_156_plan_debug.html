    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?&#39;, choice1=&#39;First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis&#39;, choice2=&#39;First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.&#39;, choice3=&#39;First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.&#39;, choice4=&#39;First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on primer design. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent OU7K:
Designing specific real-time PCR primers requires the exact viral cDNA sequence or defined gene coordinates to select optimal binding sites, calculate melting temperatures, GC content, and verify specificity. Without that information, precise oligonucleotide sequences cannot be generated; only a general workflow can be provided.

### answer by Final Decision Agent OU7K:
1. Select a conserved, unique 70–150 bp region of the viral cDNA (e.g., part of a structural or polymerase gene).
2. Input this region into primer design software (e.g., Primer3) with parameters: primer length 18–24 nt, Tm 58–60 °C, GC content 40–60%, amplicon size 70–150 bp.
3. Evaluate candidate primers for hairpins and primer–dimer formation using a tool like OligoAnalyzer.
4. Verify specificity by BLASTing each primer against the host genome and related viral sequences.
5. If using probe-based qPCR, design a hydrolysis probe (e.g., TaqMan) between the primers with a Tm ~10 °C higher than the primers and label with suitable reporter/quencher.
6. Order primers (and probe), then empirically validate efficiency via a standard curve and specificity via melt-curve or gel analysis.

Please provide the exact viral cDNA sequence or precise target gene coordinates so that specific primer (and probe) sequences can be designed.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Develop a real-time PCR kit using the designed primers for quick and accurate detection of the virus.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>To develop a real-time PCR kit you need: a validated primer/probe set, optimized master mix, controls, cycling protocol, and validation data. However, without the exact viral cDNA sequence or gene coordinates you cannot finalize probe design or optimize assay conditions precisely.

Answer:1. Assemble qPCR master mix: DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl₂, buffer.
2. Add designed primers (200–500 nM) and TaqMan probe (100–250 nM).
3. Include controls: positive (known viral cDNA), negative (no template), and internal amplification control.
4. Set thermal cycling: 95 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s, recording fluorescence each cycle.
5. Generate a standard curve with serial dilutions to determine limit of detection and efficiency.
6. Test specificity against related viruses and host nucleic acids.
7. Lyophilize or aliquot reagents, provide clear instructions, and package with controls.
