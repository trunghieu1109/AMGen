Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_156
proposed answer: To develop a real-time PCR kit you need: a validated primer/probe set, optimized master mix, controls, cycling protocol, and validation data. However, without the exact viral cDNA sequence or gene coordinates you cannot finalize probe design or optimize assay conditions precisely.

Answer:1. Assemble qPCR master mix: DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl₂, buffer.
2. Add designed primers (200–500 nM) and TaqMan probe (100–250 nM).
3. Include controls: positive (known viral cDNA), negative (no template), and internal amplification control.
4. Set thermal cycling: 95 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s, recording fluorescence each cycle.
5. Generate a standard curve with serial dilutions to determine limit of detection and efficiency.
6. Test specificity against related viruses and host nucleic acids.
7. Lyophilize or aliquot reagents, provide clear instructions, and package with controls.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_3_156
proposed answer: To prepare the final kit, we need to assemble validated reagents and consumables, produce clear labeling and instructions, ensure quality control and regulatory compliance, and establish distribution/shipment workflows.

Answer:1. Kit Assembly:
   • Aliquot purified primers, probes, master mix, positive control RNA/cDNA, and negative controls into labeled tubes or wells.  
   • Include RNase-free water, reaction buffer, reverse transcriptase/polymerase mix, and internal amplification control.
2. Lyophilization & Stability:
   • Lyophilize master mix or provide it in stabilized liquid form.
   • Package desiccant pouches and store kits at recommended temperature (e.g., 2–8 °C or ambient if validated).
3. Documentation & Labeling:
   • Prepare a comprehensive Instructions for Use (IFU) detailing sample prep, assay setup, cycling conditions, interpretation of results, and troubleshooting.
   • Include lot number, expiration date, storage conditions, and manufacturer contact on each kit component and outer box.
   • Provide a Certificate of Analysis (CoA) summarizing QC data: LOD, specificity, sensitivity, precision.
4. Quality Control:
   • Perform batch-wise QC: test one positive, one negative, and internal control to confirm assay performance.
   • Release only batches meeting predefined acceptance criteria.
5. Regulatory Compliance:
   • Compile validation dossier (analytical performance, reproducibility, stability) for regulatory submission (e.g., CE-IVD, FDA EUA).
   • Ensure manufacturing under QMS (ISO 13485) and label in accordance with regulatory guidelines.
6. Packaging & Distribution:
   • Package kits in insulated boxes with cold packs if required.
   • Include a quick-start guide and a link or QR code to online video tutorials.
   • Establish ordering, tracking, and customer support processes.
7. Training & Technical Support:
   • Offer webinars or on-site training for lab personnel.
   • Provide hot-line or email support for troubleshooting and assay optimization.
