Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_144
proposed answer: All debate agents concluded that after accounting for one redundant stereogenic element or a meso form, the effective stereogenic count is 5, yielding 2^5 = 32 stereoisomers.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_144
proposed answer: All debate agents agree on 32 stereoisomers based on 3 chiral centers and 2 stereogenic double bonds, giving 2^(3+2)=32, matching choice C).
