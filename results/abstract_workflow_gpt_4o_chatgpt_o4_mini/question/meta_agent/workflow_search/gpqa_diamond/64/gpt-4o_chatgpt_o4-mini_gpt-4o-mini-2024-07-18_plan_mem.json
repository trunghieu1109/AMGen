        "Product A ((E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one) is thermodynamically favored by conjugation and relief of ring strain under basic, intramolecular cyclization conditions. However, high dilution, strict temperature control, and an inert atmosphere are required to suppress oligomerization, polymerization, competing eliminations or retro-aldol pathways, and oxidation. Product B (lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate) is the expected stable carboxylate salt in the presence of LDA and remains intact until acidic workup. It is highly moisture-sensitive, and inadequate exclusion of water can lead to premature protonation. Strong base also risks E/Z alkene isomerization or over-deprotonation at allylic positions, so quenching must be performed carefully to avoid side-product formation.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
