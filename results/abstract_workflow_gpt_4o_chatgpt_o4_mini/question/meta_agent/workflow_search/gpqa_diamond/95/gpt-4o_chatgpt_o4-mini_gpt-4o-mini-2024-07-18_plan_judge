Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_95
proposed answer: The calculated entropy using the Bekenstein–Hawking formula is S ≃10^62 J/K, which matches choice 3 (C).

Answer:C)
