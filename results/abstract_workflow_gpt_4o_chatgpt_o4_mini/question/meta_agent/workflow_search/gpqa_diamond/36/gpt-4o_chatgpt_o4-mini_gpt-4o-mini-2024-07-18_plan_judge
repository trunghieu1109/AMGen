Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_36
proposed answer: The final product E is 3-heptene (CH3CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH3). It has a continuous seven-carbon chain with no plane of symmetry, so each carbon occupies a unique environment. Thus, there are seven distinct 13C-NMR signals.
