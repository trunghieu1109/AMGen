Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_150
proposed answer: All reasoning shows the coefficient for eigenvalue 0 is –1/√3, so the measurement probability is |–1/√3|^2 = 1/3, corresponding to choice A).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_150
proposed answer: The projection coefficient onto the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is c = –1/√3, so the probability is |c|² = 1/3.
