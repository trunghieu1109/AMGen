That corresponds to a benzene ring with an ethoxy substituent at C1, a tert-butyl at C2, and a nitro at C3. Functional groups are straightforward.; answer: Structure: a benzene ring with –OCH2CH3 at position 1, –C(CH3)3 at position 2, and –NO2 at position 3. Functional groups: aromatic ring, ether (ethoxy), tertiary alkyl (tert-butyl), and nitro.\nCoT agent Tdgl, analyzing transformations, thinking: To introduce the three substituents we must use: 1) Friedel–Crafts alkylation to install the tert-butyl group; 2) electrophilic nitration to install the nitro group; 3) a sequence of reduction (–NO2 to –NH2), diazotization (–NH2 to –N2+), hydrolysis to phenol, then Williamson etherification to convert –OH to –OEt. This addresses all three functional groups.; answer: Friedel–Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl), nitration (–NO2), reduction/diazotization/hydrolysis to phenol then Williamson ether synthesis (–OEt)\nCoT agent shT9, reviewing sequences, thinking: We can assign standard reagents and conditions to each transformation: Friedel–Crafts alkylation, electrophilic nitration, nitro reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis to phenol, and Williamson ether synthesis.
