We lack enough data to pinpoint a unique mapping of nucleotides to digits or the exact combination method.; answer: A possible rule: assign each base a fixed value (e.g. A=1, C=2, G=5, T=7), sum the values of all but the last nucleotide for the first part, use the last nucleotide’s value as the second part, and concatenate them. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide additional input→output pairs or clarify how nucleotide values are determined to confirm this pattern.\nCoT-SC agent ou2W, verifying pattern, thinking: Applying the proposed mapping A=1, C=2, G=5, T=7 and the rule “sum all but last base then concatenate with last base’s value”:\n• AGG → sum(A+G)=1+5=6, last G=5 → 65 ≠ 115\n• TGCTGA → sum(T+G+C+T+G)=7+5+2+7+5=26, last A=1 → 261 ≠ 176\nThus the rule does not reproduce either output and is inconsistent.; answer: The rule is invalid and does not consistently apply to the examples.\nCoT-SC agent F2Kr, verifying pattern, thinking: I tested the suggested mapping (A=1, C=2, G=5, T=7) using the sum-of-all-but-last concatenated with the last value rule. For AGG: 1+5=6 + last 5 gives 65, not 115. For TGCTGA: 7+5+2+7+5=26 + last 1 gives 261, not 176. Thus it fails to reproduce the examples.; answer: The proposed rule does not hold for the given examples.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide additional input–output pairs or clarify the nucleotide value assignments to further verify the pattern.\nCoT-SC agent 8de3, verifying pattern, thinking: The proposed rule (A=1, C=2, G=5, T=7, summing all but last and concatenating with last) yields 65 for AGG and 261 for TGCTGA, which do not match 115 and 176. Thus it fails to hold consistently.; answer: The identified pattern does not consistently apply to the given examples.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide additional input-output pairs or clarify the nucleotide-to-number assignments to confirm the correct mapping.\nCoT agent NajN, applying pattern, thinking: The provided rule (sum all but last then concatenate last) was invalid.
