Without knowing the exact nucleotide-to-number assignments or whether positions are weighted differently, the rule is underdetermined.; answer: Hypothesis: assign each nucleotide N a fixed numeric weight w(N) and compute the output by summing w(N) over all positions (optionally adding or multiplying by a position index factor).\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the specific nucleotide value mappings or additional input–output examples for clarification.\nCoT agent UJoE, applying hypothesis, thinking: The hypothesized rule sums fixed weights per nucleotide.
