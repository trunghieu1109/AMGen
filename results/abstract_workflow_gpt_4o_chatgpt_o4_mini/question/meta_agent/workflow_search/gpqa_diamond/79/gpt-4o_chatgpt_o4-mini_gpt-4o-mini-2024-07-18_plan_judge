Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_79
proposed answer: The rule mapping nucleotides to digits remains unclear, so applying it to ACAGTGACC is not reliably justified. However, given the prior result of 315 and its matching to choice B), that is the best candidate under uncertainty.

Answer:B)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide additional nucleotide-to-digit mappings or examples to clarify the pattern.
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_79
proposed answer: With only two inputâ€“output examples, there are infinitely many possible weight assignments to A, C, G, and T, so the rule cannot be uniquely determined and thus we cannot match ACAGTGACC to one of the given choices.
