    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -&gt; output):\n\nAGG -&gt; 115\nTGCTGA -&gt; 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?&#39;, choice1=&#39;333&#39;, choice2=&#39;315&#39;, choice3=&#39;351&#39;, choice4=&#39;185&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Apply the hypothesized rule from subtask_2 to the new input string ACAGTGACC to calculate its corresponding output number. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent UJoE:
The hypothesized rule sums fixed weights per nucleotide. However, with only two examples there are infinitely many possible weight assignments for A, C, G, and T, so we cannot determine the specific weights needed to compute the output for ACAGTGACC.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent UJoE:
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide specific weight mappings for each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) or additional input–output examples to determine the rule.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated output from subtask_3 with the given choices (333, 315, 351, 185) to determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
