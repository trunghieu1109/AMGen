    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star&#39;s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?&#34;, choice1=&#39;~0.07&#39;, choice2=&#39;~0.32&#39;, choice3=&#39;~0.11&#39;, choice4=&#39;~0.39&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated radius of the hypothetical exoplanet to the given choices and select the correct one. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 2ltM:
The spot-induced modulation amplitude δ ≃0.104 yields an equivalent transit depth. The planet-to-star radius ratio is R_pl/R_star = √δ ≃√0.104 ≃0.322, which corresponds to choice B (~0.32).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent J1JM:
The spot-induced amplitude δ ≃0.104 implies a transit depth of the same value, so R_pl/R_star = √δ ≃0.322, which corresponds to choice B (~0.32).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 5lau:
The spot-induced amplitude δ ≃0.104 yields R_pl/R_star = √δ ≃0.322, which matches choice B (~0.32).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 5PCe:
The spot-induced modulation amplitude δ ≃ 0.104 gives R_pl/R_star = √δ ≃ 0.322, matching choice B (~0.32).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
