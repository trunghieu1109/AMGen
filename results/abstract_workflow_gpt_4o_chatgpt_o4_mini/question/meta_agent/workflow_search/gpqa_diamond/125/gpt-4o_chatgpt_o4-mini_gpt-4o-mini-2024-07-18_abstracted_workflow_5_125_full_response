The achiral diol from Reaction II has no stereoisomers and thus also appears as one peak, without enantiomeric splitting.

Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH and acid. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and acid.; answer: Reaction I starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one; Reagent: LiAlH4 followed by acidic workup.\nReaction II starting material: Pentane-2,4-dione; Reagent: excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.\nCoT agent q0js, determining expected products, thinking: Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) reduces the ketone in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one to the corresponding secondary alcohol, retaining the stereochemistry at C3. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both carbonyls of pentane-2,4-dione to give the diol (pentane-2,4-diol).; answer: Reaction I product: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol; Reaction II product: pentane-2,4-diol.\nCoT agent wWbh, applying LAH reduction, thinking: Lithium aluminum hydride fully reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol with retention of configuration at C-3.; answer: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\nCoT agent hVXa, applying NaBH4 reduction, thinking: Sodium borohydride reduces both ketone groups of pentane-2,4-dione to give the corresponding diol.; answer: Pentane-2,4-diol\nCoT agent 8IAe, extracting defining features, thinking: The products are well-defined: Reaction I yields a chiral secondary alcohol with a methoxy substituent, Reaction II yields an achiral diol. No missing info.; answer: Reaction I product: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n• S configuration at C-3 (secondary alcohol)\n• Methoxy substituent at C-5\n\nReaction II product: pentane-2,4-diol\n• Two primary alcohol groups at C-2 and C-4\n• No stereocenters (achiral)\nCoT agent 9KsW, assessing impact on normal-phase HPLC, thinking: The mixture contains two distinct compounds: the chiral secondary alcohol from Reaction I and the achiral diol from Reaction II. On a normal-phase (non-chiral) HPLC column, enantiomers are not resolved and compounds separate based on polarity. The diol is more polar than the monoalcohol and thus elutes later, giving two distinct peaks.; answer: Two peaks are observed: one for the chiral secondary alcohol and one for the achiral diol (the diol elutes later due to higher polarity).\nCoT agent sBd1, assessing impact on chiral HPLC, thinking: The chiral secondary alcohol from Reaction I is enantiopure and will give a single resolved peak on a chiral column. The achiral diol from Reaction II has no stereoisomers and thus also appears as one peak, without enantiomeric splitting. Therefore, combining them yields two separate peaks on the chiral HPLC trace.; answer: The combined sample shows two peaks on chiral HPLC: one for the enantiopure secondary alcohol and one for the achiral diol.\nCoT agent 3upV, selecting number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC, thinking: The combined mixture on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column will separate compounds based solely on polarity, not chirality. The chiral secondary alcohol (from Reaction I) gives one peak (its enantiomers coelute) and the achiral diol (from Reaction II) gives a second distinct peak due to its higher polarity.; answer: 2 peaks\nCoT agent ows0, selecting number of peaks in chiral HPLC, thinking: Reaction I gives one enantiopure alcohol peak on the chiral column; Reaction II gives one peak for the achiral diol. Combined sample yields two distinct peaks.; answer: 2 peaks', iteration_idx=-1)]
