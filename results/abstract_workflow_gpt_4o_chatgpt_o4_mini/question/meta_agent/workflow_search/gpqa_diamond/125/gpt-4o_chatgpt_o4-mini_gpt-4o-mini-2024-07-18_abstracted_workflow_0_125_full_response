The existing S center at C5 is untouched, and a new stereocenter at C3 is formed. No reason for inversion at C5 or racemization, but attack at C3 is from both faces, yielding two diastereomers.; answer: 5-Methoxyhexan-3-ol with retention of the S configuration at C5 and formation of two diastereomers at C3 (one R, one S).\nCoT agent RBTP, analyzing Reaction II, thinking: Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketones at C2 and C4. Excess NaBH4 reduces both to secondary alcohols, giving 2,4-pentanediol.
