Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_125
proposed answer: Reaction I yields two diastereomers (3R,5S and 3S,5S), giving two peaks on chiral HPLC. Reaction II yields three stereoisomers: the achiral meso form (one peak) and a pair of enantiomers (two peaks) separable on a chiral column. Total peaks = 2 + 3 = 5.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_125
proposed answer: Reaction I gives one enantiopure alcohol peak on the chiral column; Reaction II gives one peak for the achiral diol. Combined sample yields two distinct peaks.
