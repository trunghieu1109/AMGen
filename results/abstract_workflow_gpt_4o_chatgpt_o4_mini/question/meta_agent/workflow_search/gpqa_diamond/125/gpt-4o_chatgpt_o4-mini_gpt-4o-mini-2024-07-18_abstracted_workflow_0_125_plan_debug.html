Example(question=&#39;An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?&#39;, choice1=&#39;3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC&#39;, choice2=&#39;5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC&#39;, choice3=&#39;4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC&#39;, choice4=&#39;3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Identify the number of distinct chemical entities produced from Reaction I. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent RhzK:
LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a chiral secondary alcohol, retaining the existing S center at C5. The new stereocenter at C3 forms as a racemic mixture, giving two diastereomers.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent RhzK:
2

### Sub-task 4: Identify the number of distinct chemical entities produced from Reaction II. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Birx:
Pentane-2,4-dione reduced by excess NaBH4 yields 2,4-pentanediol with two stereocenters. This produces three stereoisomers: the achiral meso form and a pair of enantiomers (2R,4R and 2S,4S). Thus there are three distinct chemical entities.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Birx:
3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine the number of peaks expected in chiral HPLC based on the chiral properties of the products from both reactions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Reaction I yields two diastereomers (3R,5S and 3S,5S), giving two peaks on chiral HPLC. Reaction II yields three stereoisomers: the achiral meso form (one peak) and a pair of enantiomers (two peaks) separable on a chiral column. Total peaks = 2 + 3 = 5.
