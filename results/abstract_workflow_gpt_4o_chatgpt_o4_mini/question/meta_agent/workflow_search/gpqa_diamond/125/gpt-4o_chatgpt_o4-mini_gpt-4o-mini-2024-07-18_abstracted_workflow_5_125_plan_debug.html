    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?&#39;, choice1=&#39;3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC&#39;, choice2=&#39;5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC&#39;, choice3=&#39;4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC&#39;, choice4=&#39;3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Assess the impact of combining the products from Reaction I and Reaction II on the chromatographic behavior in chiral HPLC. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent sBd1:
The chiral secondary alcohol from Reaction I is enantiopure and will give a single resolved peak on a chiral column. The achiral diol from Reaction II has no stereoisomers and thus also appears as one peak, without enantiomeric splitting. Therefore, combining them yields two separate peaks on the chiral HPLC trace.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent sBd1:
The combined sample shows two peaks on chiral HPLC: one for the enantiopure secondary alcohol and one for the achiral diol.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Select the number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC based on the analysis of the combined products.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
