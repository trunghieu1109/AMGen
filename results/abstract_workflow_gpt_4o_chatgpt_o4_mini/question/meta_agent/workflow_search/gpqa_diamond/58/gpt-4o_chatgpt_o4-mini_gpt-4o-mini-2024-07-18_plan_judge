Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_58
proposed answer: The net [H+] is negative, meaning excess OH– of 0.0824 M. Calculate pOH = –log(0.0824) ≈ 1.084, then pH = 14 – 1.084 ≈ 12.916 ≈ 12.92.

Answer:pH ≈ 12.92
Extracted answer: pH ≈ 12.92
Correct answer: 1
