Alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) donate electrons via hyperconjugation (activating, ortho/para directors). Halogens withdraw by induction but donate by resonance (deactivating overall, ortho/para directors). Carbonyl-containing groups (COOR, COOH) withdraw by resonance and induction (deactivating, meta directors). Nitro strongly withdraws by induction and resonance (strongly deactivating, meta director).; answer: 1) –CH3: activating, ortho/para director\n2) –COOC2H5: deactivating, meta director\n3) –Cl: deactivating, ortho/para director\n4) –NO2: strongly deactivating, meta director\n5) –C2H5: activating, ortho/para director\n6) –COOH: deactivating, meta director\nCoT-SC agent vOvS, determining directing effects, thinking: Activating substituents (alkyl) direct ortho/para; deactivating carbonyl or nitro direct meta; halogen deactivating but ortho/para director.; answer: 1) –CH3: ortho/para director\n2) –COOC2H5: meta director\n3) –Cl: ortho/para director\n4) –NO2: meta director\n5) –C2H5: ortho/para director\n6) –COOH: meta director\nCoT-SC agent yeZx, determining directing effects, thinking: Based on activation/deactivation and resonance/inductive effects, activating groups direct ortho/para, deactivating meta-direct.; answer: 1) –CH3: ortho/para director; 2) –COOC2H5: meta director; 3) –Cl: ortho/para director; 4) –NO2: meta director; 5) –C2H5: ortho/para director; 6) –COOH: meta director\nCoT-SC agent k9gt, determining directing effects, thinking: Based on the activating/deactivating classification: activating groups (alkyl) are ortho/para directors; deactivating groups without resonance donation (carbonyl, nitro) are meta directors; halogens, though deactivating by induction, donate by resonance and direct ortho/para.; answer: 1) –CH3: ortho/para directing\n2) –COOC2H5: meta directing\n3) –Cl: ortho/para directing\n4) –NO2: meta directing\n5) –C2H5: ortho/para directing\n6) –COOH: meta directing\nCoT agent FngS, evaluating para-isomer formation, thinking: Ortho/para directors (CH3, Cl, C2H5) give significant para product; meta directors (COOC2H5, NO2, COOH) give very little para product.; answer: 1) High para yield\n2) Very low para yield\n3) High para yield\n4) Very low para yield\n5) High para yield\n6) Very low para yield\nCoT-SC agent bv4J, ranking substances, thinking: Meta directors (NO2, COOH, COOR) give very low para yield, with the strongest deactivation (COOH) giving the least, then COOR, then NO2. Among ortho/para directors, para yield increases from CH3 < C2H5 < Cl. Thus overall order is 6<2<4<5<1<3.; answer: C)\nCoT-SC agent kB2C, ranking substances, thinking: Based on directing effects, the meta directors give very low para yields ordered by deactivation strength (COOH < COOR < NO2), and the ortho/para directors give higher para yields ordered by activation strength (C2H5 < CH3 < Cl).; answer: 6<2<4<5<1<3\nCoT-SC agent MzYQ, ranking substances, thinking: Meta directors (COOH, COOC2H5, NO2) give very low para yield, with COOH lowest, then COOC2H5, then NO2. Ortho/para directors (C2H5, CH3, Cl) give higher para yield, in order C2H5<CH3<Cl.
