proposed answer: Based on the directing effects and relative activating/deactivating strengths discussed by all agents, the most consistent qualitative order for increasing para‐isomer yield is nitro (4) < carboxyl (6) < ester (2) < halogen (3) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5). However, without details on catalyst, solvent, temperature, and bromine concentration, quantitative yields can’t be reliably estimated.

Answer:4<6<2<3<1<5
