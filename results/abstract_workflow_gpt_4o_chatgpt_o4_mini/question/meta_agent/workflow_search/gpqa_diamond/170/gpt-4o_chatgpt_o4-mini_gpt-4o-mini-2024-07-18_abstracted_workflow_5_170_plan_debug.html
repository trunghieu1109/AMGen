Example(question=&#39;Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.&#39;, choice1=&#39;3&lt;5&lt;1&lt;6&lt;2&lt;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39;, choice3=&#39;6&lt;2&lt;4&lt;5&lt;1&lt;3&#39;, choice4=&#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Select and arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer based on the assessments made. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent qWDk:
Based on electrophilic substitution directing effects and relative activating/deactivating strengths: nitro (4) is a strong meta director giving negligible para, followed by carboxyl (6), ester (2), halogen (3), methyl (1), and ethyl (5) which is the strongest ortho/para activator. However, actual weight-fraction yields depend heavily on reaction conditions (catalyst, solvent, temperature, bromine concentration) which are not provided.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KnND:
Without specified reaction conditions (catalyst, solvent, temperature, bromine concentration), precise para‐isomer weight fractions cannot be determined. Qualitatively, based on relative activating/deactivating strengths and directing effects, the order from lowest to highest para yield is: nitro (4) ≪ carboxyl (6) &lt; ester (2) &lt; halogen (3) &lt; methyl (1) &lt; ethyl (5).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 8KnK:
Based on electrophilic bromination directing effects and relative activating/deactivating strengths, the para-isomer yield increases in the order: nitro (4) &lt; carboxyl (6) &lt; ester (2) &lt; halogen (3) &lt; methyl (1) &lt; ethyl (5). However, absence of specified reaction conditions precludes quantitative yield estimation.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 2BAk:
The para-isomer yields depend strongly on reaction conditions (catalyst, solvent, temperature, bromine concentration), which are not specified. Qualitatively, the order is nitro (4) &lt; carboxyl (6) &lt; ester (2) &lt; halogen (3) &lt; methyl (1) &lt; ethyl (5), but no provided choice matches this sequence.

Please provide catalyst, solvent, temperature, and bromine concentration to estimate quantitative para-isomer yields.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on arrangement.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Based on the directing effects and relative activating/deactivating strengths discussed by all agents, the most consistent qualitative order for increasing para‐isomer yield is nitro (4) &lt; carboxyl (6) &lt; ester (2) &lt; halogen (3) &lt; methyl (1) &lt; ethyl (5). However, without details on catalyst, solvent, temperature, and bromine concentration, quantitative yields can’t be reliably estimated.
