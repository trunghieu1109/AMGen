Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_1
proposed answer: Product 3 was determined to have 11 carbon atoms, matching choice3.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_1
proposed answer: trans-cinnamaldehyde has 9 carbons; MeMgBr adds 1 →10; PCC oxidation doesn’t change the count; Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction adds one more →11 total.
