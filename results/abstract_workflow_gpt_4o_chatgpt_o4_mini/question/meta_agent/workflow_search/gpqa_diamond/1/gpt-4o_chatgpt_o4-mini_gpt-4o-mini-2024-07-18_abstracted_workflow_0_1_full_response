The phenyl ring contributes 6 C, the double bond chain contributes 2 C, and the aldehyde carbon contributes 1 C, for a total of 9 C atoms.; answer: trans-cinnamaldehyde has 9 carbon atoms.\nCoT agent Rnqc, determining reaction and structure of product 1, thinking: Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Methylmagnesium bromide performs 1,2-addition to the carbonyl, yielding after acidic workup an allylic secondary alcohol. The C=C geometry remains E.; answer: Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–CH₃ (i.e. (E)-3-phenyl-2-buten-1-ol)\nCoT agent 3I8V, identifying structure of product 1, thinking: Product 1 is the 1,2-addition product of methylmagnesium bromide to trans-cinnamaldehyde, giving (E)-3-phenyl-2-buten-1-ol. It has 6 carbons in the phenyl ring plus 4 in the butenol chain, totaling 10 carbons.; answer: Product 1 is (E)-3-phenyl-2-buten-1-ol (Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–CH₃), which has 10 carbon atoms.\nCoT agent GcJv, determining reaction and structure of product 2, thinking: PCC selectively oxidizes the secondary alcohol of product 1 (Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–CH₃) to give the corresponding ketone without touching the alkene, yielding an α,β-unsaturated ketone.; answer: Product 2 is the α,β-unsaturated ketone 3-phenyl-2-buten-1-one (Ph–CH=CH–CO–CH₃).\nCoT agent Zedw, identifying structure of product 2, thinking: Product 2 is 3-phenyl-2-buten-1-one (Ph–CH=CH–CO–CH₃). The phenyl ring contributes 6 carbons, and the side chain adds 4 more, for a total of 10 carbons.; answer: A)\nCoT agent Dc4M, determining reaction and structure of product 3, thinking: Dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane is the sulfoxonium ylide used in the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction, which converts ketones into epoxides. Product 2 (Ph–CH=CH–CO–Me) thus undergoes epoxidation at the carbonyl to give an oxirane ring between the former carbonyl carbon and the ylide’s methylene. The substituents on the ring carbon are the styryl (Ph–CH=CH–) and the methyl groups.; answer: The reaction is a Corey–Chaykovsky epoxidation of the α,β-unsaturated ketone, yielding 2-(phenylethenyl)-1-methyloxirane\nCoT agent l7Eg, identifying structure of product 3, thinking: Product 3 is the epoxide 2-(phenylethenyl)-1-methyloxirane.
