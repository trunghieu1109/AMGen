Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_182
proposed answer: All proposed structures yield formula C10H16 assuming only the formyl and carboxyl groups are reduced and the ring C=C remains. Thus IHD = (2·10+2−16)/2 = 3. However, it’s unclear if HI/red P also hydrogenates the ring double bond, which would lower H deficiency.

Answer:3
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify whether the ring double bond survives or is hydrogenated under HI/red P reduction to confirm the IHD calculation.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_182
proposed answer: Using the molecular formula C10H16, IHD = (2×10 + 2 − 16)/2 = (20 + 2 − 16)/2 = 6/2 = 3.
