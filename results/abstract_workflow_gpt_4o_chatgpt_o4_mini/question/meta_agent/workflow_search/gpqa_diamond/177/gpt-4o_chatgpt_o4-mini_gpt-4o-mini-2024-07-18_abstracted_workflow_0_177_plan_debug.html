### Sub-task 5: Assess whether the given theory is renormalizable based on the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and the criteria for renormalizability. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent aROE:
In 4D the coupling has mass dimension [κ]=4−(3/2+3/2+2)=−1, and negative-dimension couplings are nonrenormalizable as they require infinitely many counterterms.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent vwlQ:
In four dimensions, the fermion fields each have mass dimension 3/2 and the gauge field strength has dimension 2, so the interaction term has total dimension 3/2+3/2+2=5. The Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, giving [κ]=4−5=−1. Since renormalizability requires coupling dimensions ≥0, a negative-dimension coupling implies infinitely many counterterms and thus nonrenormalizability.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Xt0c:
In four dimensions the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4, the fermion fields each have dimension 3/2, and the gauge field strength has dimension 2. Thus [κ]=4−(3/2+3/2+2)=−1. A negative-mass-dimension coupling in 4D leads to infinitely many counterterms and renders the theory nonrenormalizable.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Qx1y:
In 4D the interaction term’s coupling κ has mass dimension [κ]=4−(3/2+3/2+2)=−1&lt;0. Couplings with negative mass dimension lead to infinitely many counterterms, so the theory is nonrenormalizable.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on renormalizability.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
