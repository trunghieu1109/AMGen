Question: Example(question='In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?', choice1='3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran', choice2='(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene', choice3='2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol', choice4='(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_22
proposed answer: Protonation of the alkene yields a tertiary carbocation which undergoes intramolecular attack by the aryl ether oxygen at the ortho and adjacent positions, forming a six-membered chromane and a five-membered dihydrobenzofuran, matching choice A.
