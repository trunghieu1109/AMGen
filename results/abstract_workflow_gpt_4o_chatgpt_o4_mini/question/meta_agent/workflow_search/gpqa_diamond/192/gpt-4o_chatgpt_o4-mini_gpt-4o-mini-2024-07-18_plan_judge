Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_192
proposed answer: Given N(r) ∝ r^5 and among the choices only ~r^5 matches, which is choice 4 corresponding to D).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_192
proposed answer: We start with N(plx)∼plx⁻⁵. With plx=1/r, we get N∼r⁵. To convert to per-unit-distance, include the Jacobian |d(plx)/dr|=1/r², yielding N(r)∼r³.
