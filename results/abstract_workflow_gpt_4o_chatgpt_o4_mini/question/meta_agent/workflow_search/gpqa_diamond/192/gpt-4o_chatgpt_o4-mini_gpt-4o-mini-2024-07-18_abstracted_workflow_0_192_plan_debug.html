    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ r^2&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ r^4&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ r^3&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ r^5&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Simplify the expression obtained in subtask_4 to find how the number of stars changes with distance. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvaN:
Substituting plx=1/r into N(plx)∝1/plx^5 gives N(r)∝1/(1/r)^5=r^5, already in simplest form.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvaN:
N(r) ∝ r^5

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the simplified expression with the given choices to identify the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
