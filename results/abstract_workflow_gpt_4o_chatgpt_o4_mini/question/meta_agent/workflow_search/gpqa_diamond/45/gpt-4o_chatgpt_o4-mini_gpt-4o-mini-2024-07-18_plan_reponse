        "response": "We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (two enantiomers R and S). Self\u2010metathesis gives homocoupling of R/R and S/S: each internal alkene has E and Z isomers, and R/R and S/S are enantiomeric pairs, giving 4 distinct stereoisomers. Cross\u2010coupling (R/S) also yields E and Z diastereomers, each as an enantiomeric pair, giving another 4. No other structural isomers arise, and ethene is excluded, so total = 8.\n\nAnswer:8",
