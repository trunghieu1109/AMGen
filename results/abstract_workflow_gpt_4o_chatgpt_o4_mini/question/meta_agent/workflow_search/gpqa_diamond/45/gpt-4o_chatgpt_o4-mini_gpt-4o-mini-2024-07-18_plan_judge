Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_45
proposed answer: We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (two enantiomers R and S). Self‐metathesis gives homocoupling of R/R and S/S: each internal alkene has E and Z isomers, and R/R and S/S are enantiomeric pairs, giving 4 distinct stereoisomers. Cross‐coupling (R/S) also yields E and Z diastereomers, each as an enantiomeric pair, giving another 4. No other structural isomers arise, and ethene is excluded, so total = 8.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_45
proposed answer: Self‐metathesis of racemic 3‐methylpent‐1‐ene yields two geometric isomers (E and Z), each with three stereochemical forms (RR/SS enantiomeric pair plus the RS meso form), giving a total of 6 distinct products.
