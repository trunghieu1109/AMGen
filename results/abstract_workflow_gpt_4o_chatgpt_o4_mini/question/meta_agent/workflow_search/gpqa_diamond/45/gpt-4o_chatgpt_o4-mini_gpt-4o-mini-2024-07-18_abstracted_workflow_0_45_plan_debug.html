Example(question=&#39;Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;6&#39;, choice3=&#39;8&#39;, choice4=&#39;2&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Determine the possible products formed from the olefin metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, excluding ethene. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pqlz:
Self‐metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene gives three distinct carbon frameworks: R/R homocoupling, S/S homocoupling, and R/S cross-coupling. Each framework appears as an enantiomeric pair, yielding six distinct alkene products when ethene is excluded. However, this count ignores E/Z stereoisomers of the newly formed internal double bonds and any catalyst-induced stereoselectivity, so further details are needed for a complete enumeration.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent pqlz:
Six distinct alkene products excluding ethene.
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify whether E/Z stereoisomers of the internal alkenes and any Grubbs catalyst stereoselectivity should be distinguished to fully enumerate the products.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Count the number of distinct products formed, considering stereochemistry and structural isomers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (two enantiomers R and S). Self‐metathesis gives homocoupling of R/R and S/S: each internal alkene has E and Z isomers, and R/R and S/S are enantiomeric pairs, giving 4 distinct stereoisomers. Cross‐coupling (R/S) also yields E and Z diastereomers, each as an enantiomeric pair, giving another 4. No other structural isomers arise, and ethene is excluded, so total = 8.
