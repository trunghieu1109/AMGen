    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?&#39;, choice1=&#39;At active promoters and enhancers&#39;, choice2=&#39;At repeats&#39;, choice3=&#39;In the introns of large genes&#39;, choice4=&#39;At random locations in the genome&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Select the genomic features where ChIP-seq peaks are most likely to disappear when using PFA+DSG fixation. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7Iqo:
PFA+DSG fixation adds protein–protein crosslinks that mask direct IKAROS–DNA epitopes and hinder antibody access specifically at sharp, direct-binding sites, which are enriched at active promoters and enhancers.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7Iqo:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Apply the understanding of fixation impact to predict the most likely genomic locations for disappearing peaks, focusing on active promoters and enhancers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
