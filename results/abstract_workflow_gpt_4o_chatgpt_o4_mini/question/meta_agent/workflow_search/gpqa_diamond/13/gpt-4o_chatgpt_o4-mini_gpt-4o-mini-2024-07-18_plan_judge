Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_13
proposed answer: PFA+DSG fixation masks direct IKAROS–DNA binding at sharp sites found at active promoters and enhancers, so peaks there disappear.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_13
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that dual PFA+DSG fixation abolishes narrow, high-signal TF–DNA crosslinks at active regulatory elements, leading to peak loss at promoters and enhancers.
