Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_26
proposed answer: The SRP binds the nascent peptide on cytosolic ribosomes and directs it into the ER lumen for glycosylation, leading to secretion outside the cell. Thus the meeting is in the cytosol and the chain heads to the extracellular space.

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_26
proposed answer: The signal recognition particle binds the nascent chain at the ER membrane in the cytosol and directs it into the secretory pathway for extracellular secretion, matching choice D.
