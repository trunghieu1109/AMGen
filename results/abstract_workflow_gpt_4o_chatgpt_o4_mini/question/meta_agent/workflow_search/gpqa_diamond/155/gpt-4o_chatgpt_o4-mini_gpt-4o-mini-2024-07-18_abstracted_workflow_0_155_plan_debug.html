    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, choice2=&#39;3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, choice3=&#39;2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, choice4=&#39;2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 5: Determine the number of peaks expected in a chiral HPLC column based on the distinct products identified. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent SLDV:
On a chiral HPLC column the achiral meso cis-diol gives one peak, while the racemic trans-diol resolves into two enantiomer peaks, for a total of three distinct peaks.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent lsQb:
The mixture contains an achiral meso cis-diol (one peak) and a racemic pair of trans-diols, which are resolved into two enantiomer peaks on a chiral HPLC column, giving a total of three distinct peaks.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent dWoS:
The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene gives a racemic trans-diol (two enantiomers) and (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a meso cis-diol (achiral). On a chiral HPLC column, the two enantiomers of the racemate will be resolved into two peaks, and the meso diol will give a single peak, for a total of three distinct peaks.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Pa1V:
The mixture contains an achiral meso cis-diol (one peak) and a racemic pair of trans-diols that are resolved into two enantiomer peaks on a chiral column, giving three total peaks.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent SLDV:
3 peaks

### answer #3 by Debate Agent lsQb:
3 peaks

### answer #3 by Debate Agent dWoS:
3 peaks

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Pa1V:
3 peaks

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on peaks in chiral HPLC.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
