No additional data are needed.; answer: (E)-oct-4-ene: an eight-carbon internal alkene with substituents across the C=C in trans (opposite) arrangement; achiral.  (Z)-oct-4-ene: the corresponding cis (same side) internal alkene; also achiral.\nCoT agent 9CMA, understanding reaction conditions, thinking: The peracid mCPBA effects a stereospecific epoxidation of the alkene. The subsequent aqueous acid protonates and opens the epoxide, giving an anti (trans) vicinal diol.; answer: mCPBA epoxidizes the alkene to an epoxide, and aqueous acid then opens the epoxide to give the anti vicinal diol.\nCoT agent FVwp, determining products from Reaction 1, thinking: The E (trans) alkene yields, via stereospecific syn epoxidation, a racemic trans-epoxide; acid‐catalyzed ring opening gives the anti vicinal diol with inversion at one center, so each epoxide enantiomer gives one diol enantiomer. Thus the product is a racemic mixture of the anti (trans) 4,5-octanediol.; answer: A racemic mixture of the anti (trans) 4,5-octanediol (two enantiomers).\nCoT agent x2dl, determining products from Reaction 2, thinking: Epoxidation of the cis‐alkene gives a cis‐epoxide that is achiral (meso). Acidic opening proceeds anti to give the vicinal diol with internal symmetry, i.e. the meso diol.; answer: The reaction yields meso-4,5-octanediol (an anti vicinal diol that is achiral).\nCoT agent vIoB, analyzing stereochemistry, thinking: Epoxidation of the trans alkene is stereospecific (syn) giving a racemic trans-epoxide; acid‐catalyzed anti opening yields the anti diol as a racemic pair. Epoxidation of the cis alkene gives a cis‐epoxide (meso); anti opening yields the meso anti diol (achiral).; answer: Reaction 1: racemic anti-4,5-octanediol (enantiomeric pair). Reaction 2: meso anti-4,5-octanediol (single achiral diastereomer).\nCoT agent XqT4, identifying unique compounds, thinking: Reaction 1 gives two enantiomers (racemic anti diol), Reaction 2 gives one meso diol. Total unique compounds = 2 + 1 = 3.; answer: 3\nCoT agent kKb8, assessing behavior on standard HPLC, thinking: On an achiral reverse-phase column, the two enantiomers of the racemic anti diol coelute as one peak, and the meso diol elutes separately—giving two peaks in total.; answer: [ERROR]\nCoT agent RA37, assessing behavior on chiral HPLC, thinking: The racemic anti diol from Reaction 1 gives two enantiomers which the chiral column will resolve into separate peaks, and the meso diol from Reaction 2 is achiral and appears as a single peak, for a total of three peaks.; answer: 3 peaks\nCoT agent HaTL, determining peaks in standard HPLC, thinking: On an achiral reverse‐phase column, the racemic anti diol enantiomers coelute as one peak and the meso diol elutes separately, giving two peaks.; answer: 2 peaks\nCoT agent 8CyV, determining peaks in chiral HPLC, thinking: The racemic anti diol from Reaction 1 gives two enantiomers that the chiral column resolves into separate peaks, and the meso diol from Reaction 2 is achiral and appears as a single peak, for a total of three peaks.; answer: 3 peaks\nCoT agent zMt4, selecting correct choice, thinking: Based on sub-task 9 there are 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and based on sub-task 10 there are 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, matching choice 3.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
