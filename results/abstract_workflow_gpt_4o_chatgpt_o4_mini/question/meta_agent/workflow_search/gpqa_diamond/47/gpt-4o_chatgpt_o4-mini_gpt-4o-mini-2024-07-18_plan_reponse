Without stereochemical assignment the ring symmetry and equivalence of hydrogens cannot be determined unambiguously. Assuming a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane in its chair form yields six chemically distinct hydrogen sets, but this is only one possible stereochemical scenario.\n\nAnswer:6\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the stereochemical configuration (cis/trans and axial/equatorial positions) of the OH and Cl substituents to enumerate all distinct hydrogen environments accurately.",
