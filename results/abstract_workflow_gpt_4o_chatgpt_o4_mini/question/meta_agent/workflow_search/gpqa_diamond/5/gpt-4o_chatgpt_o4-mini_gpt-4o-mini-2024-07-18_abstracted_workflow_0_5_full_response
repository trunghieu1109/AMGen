In polar form, V(r,θ)=(k/2)(1+3\u2009cos²θ)\u2009r². Converting to Cartesian (x=r\u2009cosθ, y=r\u2009sinθ) yields distinct quadratic terms in x and y, showing anisotropy and separability.; answer: The potential can be written as V(r,θ)=(k/2)(1+3\u2009cos²θ)\u2009r². In Cartesian coordinates: V(x,y)=2k\u2009x²+(k/2)\u2009y², i.e. an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with spring constants k_x=4k, k_y=k (frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m)).\nCoT-SC agent vBSO, determining quantum model, thinking: Sub-task 1 showed that the potential is a sum of independent x- and y-quadratic terms corresponding to two harmonic oscillators with different spring constants. The appropriate quantum model is therefore the separable 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates.; answer: Use the separable 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator in x and y with ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).\nCoT-SC agent qPsw, determining quantum model, thinking: Given V(x,y)=2k x^2+(k/2) y^2 from Sub‐task 1, the system is an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator. Quantum mechanically, we separate variables in x and y and treat each as an independent 1D harmonic oscillator with its own frequency.; answer: Use the separable anisotropic two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator model, treating x and y as independent 1D oscillators with ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).\nCoT-SC agent HTjb, determining quantum model, thinking: From the Cartesian form V(x,y)=2k x^2+(k/2) y^2 we see two independent quadratic potentials with different force constants. The Schrödinger equation thus separates into two 1D harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).; answer: Use the 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator model by separating variables in x and y and solving two independent 1D oscillators with ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).\nCoT agent fIYm, deriving energy spectrum, thinking: We model the motion as two independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).
