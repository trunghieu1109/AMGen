These are standard 1D harmonic-oscillator equations with frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).\nCritic agent IbWZ, providing feedback, thinking: The Cartesian rewriting V(x,y)=2k x²+½k y² is correct, and the ansatz ψ(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) properly separates the Schrödinger equation into two 1D harmonic oscillators. Identifying ω_x via ½mω_x²=2k and ω_y via ½mω_y²=½k leads to ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m), as stated. The separation is applied consistently.; answer: The separation of variables is correctly performed, yielding two independent 1D oscillator equations with the right frequencies ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m).\nReflexion CoT agent uTKf, refining separation of variables, thinking: To apply separation of variables we rewrite V in Cartesian form, insert the ansatz ψ(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) into the 2D Schrödinger equation, divide by XY, and group x- and y-dependent terms, introducing separation constants E_x and E_y.; answer: Use the ansatz ψ(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) in\n  −(ħ²/2m)(∂²ψ/∂x²+∂²ψ/∂y²)+[2k x²+(½k)y²]ψ=Eψ.\nDivide by X(x)Y(y) to get\n  [−(ħ²/2m)X''(x)+2k x²X(x)]/X(x)\n+ [−(ħ²/2m)Y''(y)+(½k)y²Y(y)]/Y(y)=E.\nEach bracket equals a constant (E_x, E_y) with E_x+E_y=E, yielding two 1D HO equations:\n  −(ħ²/2m)X''+2k x²X=E_xX,\n  −(ħ²/2m)Y''+(½k)y²Y=E_yY.\nCritic agent IbWZ, providing feedback, thinking: The separation of variables is handled correctly: converting V(r,θ)=½kr²+3/2 kr²cos²θ into Cartesian form V(x,y)=2kx²+(½k)y², assuming ψ(x,y)=X(x)Y(y), dividing by XY and introducing E_x+E_y=E yields two independent 1D Schrödinger equations. One improvement is to explicitly map each potential term onto the standard ½mω²x² form to extract the oscillator frequencies (ω_x and ω_y) and to note that X and Y are solved by Hermite‐function eigenstates.; answer: Rewrite H=H_x+H_y with H_x=−(ħ²/2m)d²/dx²+2k x² and H_y=−(ħ²/2m)d²/dy²+(½k) y². Match 2k x²=½mω_x²x² ⇒ ω_x=2√(k/m) and ½k y²=½mω_y²y² ⇒ ω_y=√(k/m).
