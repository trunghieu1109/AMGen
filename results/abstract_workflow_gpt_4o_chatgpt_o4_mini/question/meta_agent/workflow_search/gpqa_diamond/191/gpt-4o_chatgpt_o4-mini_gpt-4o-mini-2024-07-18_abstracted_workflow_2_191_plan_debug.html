    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;, correct_index=3).

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent sKkE:
Outside the conductor, the induced charges rearrange so that the net field is that of a point charge +q at the centre, giving E = q/(4πε₀L²) by Gauss’s law, which matches choice D).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent PLKn:
Outside the conductor the electric field is identical to that of a point charge +q at the centre by Gauss’s law, giving E = q/(4πε₀L²), which corresponds to choice 4 (D).
