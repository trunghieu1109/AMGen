Example(question=&#39;The |3,0,0\\rangle state in the standard notation |n,l,m\\rangle of the H -atom in the non-relativistic theory decays to the state |1,0,0\\rangle via two dipole transition. The transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex),&#39;, choice1=&#39;|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\nand \\frac{1}{4}&#39;, choice2=&#39;|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}&#39;, choice3=&#39;|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}&#39;, choice4=&#39;\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and \\frac{2}{3}&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated probabilities from Sub-task 3 with the given probabilities in the choices to determine the correct transition path and probability. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent InID:
From the calculated branching ratios P(m=±1)=1/4 and P(m=0)=1/2, only the route via m=+1 with probability 1/4 matches one of the given choices.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 368G:
From Sub-task 3 we have branching ratios P(m=±1)=1/4 and P(m=0)=1/2. Among the provided choices only the m=+1 route with probability 1/4 matches choice A.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent sfbr:
From Sub-task 3 the branching ratios are P(m=±1)=1/4 each and P(m=0)=1/2. Comparing these with the provided choices, only the m=1 route with P=1/4 (choice A) matches.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent cSDY:
From Sub-task 3 the branching ratios are 1/4 for m=±1 and 1/2 for m=0. The only provided choice with P=1/4 corresponding to m=+1 is choice A.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct transition path and probability.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
