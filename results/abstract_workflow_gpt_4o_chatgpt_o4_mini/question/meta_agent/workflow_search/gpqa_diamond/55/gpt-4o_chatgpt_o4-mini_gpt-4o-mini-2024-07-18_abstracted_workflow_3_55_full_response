These are standard: change in orbital quantum number Δl=±1, change in magnetic quantum number Δm=0,±1, and no strict selection for n apart from energy decrease for emission.; answer: Dipole transition rules for hydrogen (non‐relativistic):\n1) Δn: any (but for emission n_initial>n_final)\n2) Δl = ±1\n3) Δm = 0, ±1\nAdditionally, parity must change (since dipole operator is odd). No other quantum numbers change.\nCoT-SC agent qDAU, thinking: Apply dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1. For each path from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: 1) m = +1: Δl = +1, Δm = +1 allowed for first step; Δl = –1, Δm = –1 allowed for second step. 2) m = 0: Δl = +1, Δm = 0; Δl = –1, Δm = 0 both allowed. 3) m = –1: Δl = +1, Δm = –1; Δl = –1, Δm = +1 both allowed. 4) The fourth choice lacks the initial |3,0,0⟩ state, so it is not a valid transition path.; answer: Transition 1: Allowed\nTransition 2: Allowed\nTransition 3: Allowed\nTransition 4: Invalid (missing initial state)\nCoT-SC agent 6Hfh, thinking: We apply Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1 to each step. For choice1: 3,0,0→2,1,1 (Δl=+1,Δm=+1), 2,1,1→1,0,0 (Δl=−1,Δm=−1) both allowed. Choice2: 3,0,0→2,1,0 (Δl=+1,Δm=0), 2,1,0→1,0,0 (Δl=−1,Δm=0) allowed. Choice3: 3,0,0→2,1,−1 (Δl=+1,Δm=−1), 2,1,−1→1,0,0 (Δl=−1,Δm=+1) allowed. Choice4 same path as choice2 also allowed.; answer: All four transition routes satisfy the dipole selection rules and are allowed.\nCoT-SC agent zfHR, thinking: We apply dipole selection rules Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1 for each step:\nPath1: |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>: Δl=+1, Δm=+1 allowed; |2,1,1>→|1,0,0>: Δl=–1, Δm=–1 allowed.\nPath2: |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>: Δl=+1, Δm=0 allowed; |2,1,0>→|1,0,0>: Δl=–1, Δm=0 allowed.\nPath3: |3,0,0>→|2,1,–1>: Δl=+1, Δm=–1 allowed; |2,1,–1>→|1,0,0>: Δl=–1, Δm=+1 allowed.; answer: All three transition paths are allowed under the dipole selection rules.\nReflexion CoT agent Kkx7, thinking: To get the branching ratios we evaluate the dipole matrix elements between |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,m⟩ and then |2,1,m⟩→|1,0,0⟩. The radial part is the same for all m, so the relative probabilities come solely from the angular integrals (Clebsch–Gordan coefficients). One finds |⟨1,m|Y_{1q}|0,0⟩|^2∝{1/4,1/3,1/4} for m=±1,0,±1 respectively.; answer: P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/4;\nP(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3;\nP(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,−1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/4\nCritic agent dVMJ, thinking: Your probabilities 1/4, 1/3, 1/4 sum to 5/6, not 1. The angular dipole matrix elements yield P(m=±1)=1/4 each and P(m=0)=1/2, so the branching ratios should be 1/4, 1/2, 1/4.; answer: P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,±1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/4 each; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/2\nReflexion CoT agent Kkx7, refining probability calculations, thinking: The dipole matrix elements factor into a common radial part and angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. For transitions |3,0,0〉→|2,1,m〉→|1,0,0〉 the radial integrals cancel in the branching ratios, leaving |⟨1,m;1,q|0,0⟩|^2∝{1/4,1/2,1/4} for m=±1,0. Hence the probabilities sum to unity as required.; answer: P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = 1/2; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4\nCritic agent dVMJ, thinking: The probability calculation is correct. Using the angular part of the dipole matrix elements and Clebsch–Gordan coefficients yields branching ratios of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 for m = +1, 0, and –1 respectively, summing to unity as required.; answer: P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = 1/2; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,–1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4\nReflexion CoT agent Kkx7, refining probability calculations, thinking: I applied angular dipole matrix elements and Clebsch–Gordan coefficients and found branching ratios of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 for m=+1, 0, -1 respectively, summing to unity.; answer: P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = 1/2; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4\nCritic agent dVMJ, thinking: The branching ratios should be equal for m' = +1, 0, –1 due to the symmetry of the dipole operator and the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. Each path has probability 1/3, not 1/4, 1/2, 1/4.; answer: P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/3; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = 1/3; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,–1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/3\nReflexion CoT agent Kkx7, refining probability calculations, thinking: The dipole matrix elements factor into a common radial part and angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. Evaluating the angular parts for the two-step decay and normalizing yields branching ratios of 1/4 for m=±1 and 1/2 for m=0, summing to unity.; answer: P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = 1/2; P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/4\nDebate agent InID, round 0, thinking: From Sub-task 3 the branching ratios are P(m=±1)=1/4 each and P(m=0)=1/2.
