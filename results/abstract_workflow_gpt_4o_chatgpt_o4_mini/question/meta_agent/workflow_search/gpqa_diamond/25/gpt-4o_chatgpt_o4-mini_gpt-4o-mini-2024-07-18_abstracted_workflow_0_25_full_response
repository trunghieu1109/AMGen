In contrast, 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one is a conjugated cyclobutenone with significant steric hindrance and reduced electrophilicity, making it far less prone to cycloaddition. Thus the ketene is the correct reactant.; answer: 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one\nCoT-SC agent Tju0, determining reactant, thinking: Cyclohexene undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition most readily with a highly electrophilic ketene. 2,2-Diiodoethen-1-one combines strong electron withdrawal from iodines plus the reactive ketene C=O, making it ideal for cycloaddition to give the bicyclo[4.2.0]octanone. 4,4-Diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one is sterically hindered and less electrophilic, so it is less reactive.; answer: B)\nCoT-SC agent YpbY, determining reactant, thinking: Cyclohexene requires a highly electrophilic alkene for [2+2] cycloaddition. The diiodoketene (2,2-diiodoethen-1-one) is extremely reactive due to the ketene functionality and electron-withdrawing iodines, whereas the cyclobutenone is sterically hindered and less electrophilic. Thus the ketene reacts to give the bicyclo[4.2.0]octanone.; answer: 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one\nCoT-SC agent kWQk, determining reactant, thinking: Cyclohexene undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition most readily with a highly electrophilic ketene partner. 2,2-Diiodoethen-1-one is a diiodoketene with strong electron-withdrawing iodines, making it extremely reactive toward cyclohexene to form the bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. In contrast, 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one is a conjugated cyclobutenone with steric hindrance and lower electrophilicity, so it is far less reactive in this cycloaddition.; answer: 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one\nCoT agent cUYe, analyzing diene reactivity, thinking: Cyclopentadiene is locked in an s-cis conformation and has higher HOMO energy, making it the most reactive.
