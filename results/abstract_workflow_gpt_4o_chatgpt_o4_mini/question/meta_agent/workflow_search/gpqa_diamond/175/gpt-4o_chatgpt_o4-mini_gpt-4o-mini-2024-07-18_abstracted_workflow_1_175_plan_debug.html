    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?&#39;, choice1=&#39;1/2&#39;, choice2=&#39;1/6&#39;, choice3=&#39;1/3&#39;, choice4=&#39;2/3&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Apply the operator Q to the state vector obtained after measuring P to find the state of the system after measuring Q. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent EwuQ:
We have the post-P state ψ = (1/√2, 0, 1/√2). The operator Q = diag(1,0,-1) acts as Qψ = (1·1/√2, 0·0, -1·1/√2) = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), which is already normalized.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent EwuQ:
(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Determine the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue -1 for the operator Q from the resulting state vector.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The post-P state is ψ=(1/√2,0,1/√2). Measuring Q, the eigenvector for eigenvalue –1 is (0,0,1), so the probability is |ψ₃|²=(1/√2)²=1/2.
