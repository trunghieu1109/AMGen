Divide each component by sqrt(6).; answer: (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)\nCoT-SC agent 6VlH, calculating probability for P, thinking: First find the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0: solving P\u2009v=0 gives v=(1,0,−1)/√2. Projector onto this subspace is |v><v|. Compute inner product ⟨v|ψ⟩ where ψ=(−1,2,1)/√6:\n⟨v|ψ⟩=(1/√2)(−1/√6)+0+(-1/√2)(1/√6)=−2/√12=−1/√3. Squared modulus gives probability=1/3.; answer: 1/3\nCoT-SC agent zM54, calculating probability for P, thinking: First normalize the state: |ψ⟩ = (−1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). The zero‐eigenvalue eigenspace of P is spanned by |φ₀⟩ = (1,0,−1)/√2. Compute ⟨φ₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(−1/√6)+(−1/√2)(1/√6)=−2/√12=−1/√3, so the probability is |−1/√3|²=1/3.; answer: 1/3\nCoT-SC agent RaKP, calculating probability for P, thinking: The normalized state is (-1/√6,2/√6,1/√6). Operator P has eigenvalue 0 with normalized eigenvector (1/√2,0,-1/√2). The inner product is (1/√2)(-1/√6)+(0)+(−1/√2)(1/√6)=−1/√3, so the probability is |−1/√3|^2=1/3.; answer: 1/3\nReflexion CoT agent EFkG, determining post-measurement state, thinking: After measuring P with outcome 0, the state collapses to the normalized eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0. Solving P\u2006v=0 gives v∝(1,0,−1), which normalized is (1/√2,0,−1/√2).; answer: (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)\nCritic agent zFAE, providing feedback, thinking: The post-measurement state (1/√2, 0, –1/√2) is indeed the normalized eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0. However, it is only defined up to an overall (global) phase or sign: multiplying by –1 yields the same physical state, and no further phase information is fixed by the measurement.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent EFkG, refining post-measurement state, thinking: After measuring P with outcome 0, the system collapses onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector of P. Solving P\u2009v=0 gives v∝(1,0,–1), and normalizing yields (1/√2,0,–1/√2). Note that this vector is defined only up to an overall global phase, which does not affect physical predictions.; answer: (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) (up to an overall global phase)\nCritic agent zFAE, providing feedback, thinking: The post‐measurement state (1/√2, 0, –1/√2) is correctly identified as the normalized eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0. However, its overall phase (and even an overall sign) is physically unobservable and hence ambiguous. If the eigenspace were degenerate, any normalized superposition within that subspace would also be a valid post‐measurement state. The provided answer does not discuss these ambiguities, nor does it remark on the choice of sign or phase, which can matter when comparing to other basis states in subsequent calculations.; answer: Post‐measurement state: |ψ₀⟩ = (1/√2, 0, –1/√2), defined only up to an overall (unobservable) phase or sign. If the 0‐eigenvalue were degenerate, the state could be any normalized superposition within the corresponding eigenspace.\nReflexion CoT agent EFkG, refining post-measurement state, thinking: Measuring P with outcome 0 projects the state onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0. Solving P\u2009v=0 gives v∝(1,0,−1), and normalizing yields (1/√2,0,−1/√2). The overall phase (or sign) of this vector is physically unobservable.; answer: (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) (up to an overall global phase)\nCritic agent zFAE, providing feedback, thinking: The agent correctly found the 0‐eigenvector of P and normalized it to (1/√2, 0, −1/√2). The key limitations are:\n1) Global phase (or overall sign) is physically irrelevant but left undetermined.\n2) If the 0-eigenspace were degenerate, any orthonormal basis spanning it would be an equally valid post-measurement state, so the choice of (1/√2,0,−1/√2) depends on a convention.\n3) This treatment assumes an ideal von Neumann (projective) measurement without noise, decoherence, or experimental imperfections.; answer: (1/√2, 0, −1/√2) up to an overall global phase\nReflexion CoT agent EFkG, refining post-measurement state, thinking: Measuring P with outcome 0 projects the state onto the P-eigenspace for eigenvalue 0.
