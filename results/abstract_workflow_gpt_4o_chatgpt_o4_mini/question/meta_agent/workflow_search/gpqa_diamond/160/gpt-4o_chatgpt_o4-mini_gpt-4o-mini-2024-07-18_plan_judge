Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_160
proposed answer: Given that electron–molecule scattering cross‐sections are smaller than molecule–molecule collisions, the mean free path for electrons λ2 exceeds λ1 but remains below 1.22·λ1, matching choice2.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_160
proposed answer: Under high-energy electron beams, electron–molecule scattering cross-sections exceed molecule–molecule cross-sections, reducing the electron mean free path relative to the gas-only mean free path.
