Example(question=&#39;In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)&#39;, choice1=&#39;4-chlorobenzoic acid&#39;, choice2=&#39;2-chlorobenzoic acid&#39;, choice3=&#39;3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;Phenyl chloroformate&#39;, correct_index=0).

The mass spectrum (M⁺ at 156/158) indicates C7H5ClO2 with one Cl; IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O consistent with a carboxylic acid; 1H NMR shows an 11.0 ppm singlet (COOH, 1H) and two aromatic doublets (2H each) indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene. These data best match 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Make final decision on correct structure.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
