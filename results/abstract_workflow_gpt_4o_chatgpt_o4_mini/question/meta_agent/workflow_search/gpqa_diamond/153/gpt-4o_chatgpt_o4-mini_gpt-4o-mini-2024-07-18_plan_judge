Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_153
proposed answer: Mass spec, IR, and NMR data consistently point to a para-disubstituted benzene carboxylic acid with one chlorine. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid matches the molecular weight, isotopic pattern, broad OH stretch, sharp C=O, COOH singlet at 11.0 ppm, and two aromatic doublets (2H each).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_153
proposed answer: The spectral data (M⁺ at 156/158 indicating C7H5ClO2, broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H, sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O, ¹H NMR 11.0 ppm singlet and two aromatic doublets) match a para-substituted benzoic acid with one Cl, i.e., 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
