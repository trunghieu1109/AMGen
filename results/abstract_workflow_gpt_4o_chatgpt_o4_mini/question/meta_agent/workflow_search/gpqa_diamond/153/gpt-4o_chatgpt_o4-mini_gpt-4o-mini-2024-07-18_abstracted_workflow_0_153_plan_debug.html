 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent SCO9:
Mass spectrometry gives M⁺ at 156 with an M+2 peak consistent with one Cl in C7H5ClO2. IR shows a broad O–H stretch (3500–2700 cm⁻¹) and a sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicative of a carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR displays a COOH singlet at 11.0 ppm and two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all data.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 76RQ:
Mass spectrometry shows M⁺=156 with an M+2 peak (~32%) indicating one Cl in C7H5ClO2. IR exhibits a broad O–H stretch (3500–2700 cm⁻¹) and a sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR displays a COOH singlet at 11.0 ppm and two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, consistent with a para‐disubstituted benzene. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the data.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Make final decision on most likely structure.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
