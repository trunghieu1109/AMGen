Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_168
proposed answer: The variant decay yields a three-body final state (two electrons + one massless particle), so the summed electron energy spectrum remains continuous with the same endpoint Q. No provided choice matches “continuous with unchanged endpoint,” so the correct response is [ERROR].

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_168
proposed answer: With one less massless particle carrying away energy, more of the Q-value is available to the E particles at the kinematic limit, so their maximum total energy increases.

Answer:The endpoint increases.
Extracted answer: The endpoint increases.
Correct answer: 2
