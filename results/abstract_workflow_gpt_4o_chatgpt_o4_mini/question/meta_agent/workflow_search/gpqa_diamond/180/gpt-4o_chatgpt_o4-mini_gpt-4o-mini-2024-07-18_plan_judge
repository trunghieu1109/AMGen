Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_180
proposed answer: Since stopping the pp-III branch eliminates all 700–800 keV neutrinos (flux→0) while the 800–900 keV flux remains nonzero, the ratio is 0.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_180
proposed answer: Stopping the pp-III branch removes essentially all neutrinos in the 700–800 keV band while the 800–900 keV band still receives the 0.862 MeV 7Be line, so the flux ratio is effectively zero. The smallest nonzero choice is 0.01.

Answer:D)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the detailed 8B neutrino differential flux spectrum (dΦ/dE) to refine the 700–800 keV band flux estimate.
