    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, choice1=&#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, choice2=&#39;10.&#39;, choice3=&#39;1.&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the new neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV energy band after stopping the pp-III branch. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent WUS7:
The 700–800 keV solar neutrinos originate exclusively from the ^8B decay of the pp-III branch. Halting pp-III removes all ^8B production, so after the light‐travel delay the flux in that band drops to zero.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WUS7:
Zero neutrinos/cm^2/s

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the new neutrino flux in the 800-900 keV energy band after stopping the pp-III branch. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent sizd:
We cannot compute the exact new flux without knowing the precise fraction of ^8B neutrinos that fall into the 800–900 keV bin. Stopping pp-III only removes the small 8B tail in that window, leaving the dominant 7Be line at 861 keV intact. The change is ≪1%, but to get a numerical value we need the SSM differential flux in that energy range.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent sizd:
Φ_new(800–900 keV) ≃ Φ_old(800–900 keV) (reduction ≪1%) [TOO_HARD]
Please provide the SSM differential flux of ^8B neutrinos in the 800–900 keV bin to estimate the exact drop.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compute the ratio of the new flux in the 700-800 keV band to the new flux in the 800-900 keV band.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Since stopping the pp-III branch eliminates all 700–800 keV neutrinos (flux→0) while the 800–900 keV flux remains nonzero, the ratio is 0.
