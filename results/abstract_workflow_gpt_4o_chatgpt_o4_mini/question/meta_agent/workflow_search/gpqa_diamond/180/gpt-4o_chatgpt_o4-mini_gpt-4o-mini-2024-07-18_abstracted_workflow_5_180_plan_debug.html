Example(question=&#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, choice1=&#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, choice2=&#39;10.&#39;, choice3=&#39;1.&#39;, choice4=&#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Assess the impact of stopping the pp-III branch on the ratio of neutrino fluxes between the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV energy bands. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent wKDT:
Shutting off the pp-III (8B) branch removes essentially all neutrinos in the 700–800 keV band (≈0 cm⁻² s⁻¹), while the 800–900 keV band remains at ≈5.2×10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹ from ⁷Be. Thus the ratio is ≈0. However, without the precise 8B differential spectrum, the narrow‐band integration can’t be refined.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent wKDT:

[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the detailed 8B neutrino differential flux spectrum (dΦ/dE) to refine the 700–800 keV band flux estimate.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Select the correct ratio from the given choices based on the calculated impact.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Stopping the pp-III branch removes essentially all neutrinos in the 700–800 keV band while the 800–900 keV band still receives the 0.862 MeV 7Be line, so the flux ratio is effectively zero. The smallest nonzero choice is 0.01.
