Question: Example(question='Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2×2 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue, φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c∙S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? ', choice1='The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.', choice2='The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.', choice3='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1. ', choice4='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π. ', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_34
proposed answer: Since [Ay, A^2]=0, the eigenstates of Ay are also eigenstates of A^2, but [Ay, Az]≠0 so they cannot be eigenstates of Az. The other statements are incorrect.

proposed answer: The eigenvalues ±h/(4π) are real, so statements about imaginary parts (choices 3 and 4) are incorrect. Ay commutes with A² but not with Az, so its eigenfunctions can be common with A² but not with Az. Therefore choice1 is correct.
