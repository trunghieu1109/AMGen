This is straightforward, no extra info needed.; answer: S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] is the Pauli σ_y matrix. It is Hermitian (σ_y†=σ_y), traceless, and satisfies σ_y^2=I. Thus Ay=c S is Hermitian with eigenvalues ±c, and its eigenvectors are those of σ_y (e.g., (1, ±i)/√2).\nCoT-SC agent DUTa, understanding Ay and S relationship, thinking: Sub-task 2 asks how Ay relates to S given Ay = c·S with c = h/4π. Since S is known (Pauli σ_y), Ay is simply that matrix multiplied by c. Thus Ay inherits S’s eigenvectors and has eigenvalues scaled by c (±1→±c).; answer: Ay = (h/4π)·[[0, -i], [i, 0]]; its eigenvectors are those of S (e.g. (1/√2)[1, ±i]^T) and its eigenvalues are ±h/4π.\nCoT-SC agent MZ1V, understanding Ay and S relationship, thinking: The question asks to articulate the relation Ay = c·S with c = h/4π. No multiple‐choice prompt, so I give a direct explanation.; answer: The operator Ay is simply the Pauli matrix σy multiplied by the constant c = h/4π. Thus Ay = (h/4π)·S, so Ay has the same eigenvectors as S and its eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of S (±1) scaled by h/4π, i.e. ±h/4π.\nCoT-SC agent zRRd, understanding Ay and S relationship, thinking: The sub-task asks how Ay relates to S via the scalar c. Since S is the Pauli σ_y matrix with eigenvalues ±1 and eigenvectors (1,±i)/√2, multiplying by c=h/4π simply scales those eigenvalues and leaves eigenvectors unchanged.; answer: Ay=c·S means Ay is the Pauli σ_y matrix scaled by h/4π, so its eigenvalues are ±h/4π and its eigenvectors are the same as those of S (e.g. (1,±i)/√2).\nCoT agent kOYu, calculating eigenvalues of Ay, thinking: S is the Pauli σ_y matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay=c·S with c=h/4π, its eigenvalues are ±c.; answer: Eigenvalues are +h/4π and -h/4π.\nCoT agent 5ZNk, calculating eigenvectors of Ay, thinking: To find eigenvectors of Ay = c·S, solve (S−λI)φ=0 for λ=±1 then multiply by normalization; these φ are also eigenvectors of Ay.; answer: Eigenvector for eigenvalue +h/4π: (1/√2) [1, i]^T; eigenvector for eigenvalue −h/4π: (1/√2) [1, −i]^T.\nDebate agent TNnd, round 0, evaluating statements, thinking: The eigenvectors of Ay are spin-up and spin-down along y and are also eigenstates of S^2 but not of Sz, so choice1 is correct.; answer: A)\nDebate agent 54a4, round 0, evaluating statements, thinking: The eigenvectors of Ay are spin-½ states that diagonalize Ay and thus also A^2, but they are not eigenstates of Az.
