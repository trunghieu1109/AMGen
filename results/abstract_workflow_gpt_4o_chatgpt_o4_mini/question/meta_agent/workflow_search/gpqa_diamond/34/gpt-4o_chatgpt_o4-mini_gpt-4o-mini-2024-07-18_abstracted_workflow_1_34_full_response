Solving (Ay–λI)v=0 for Ay=(h/4π)[[0,−i],[i,0]] and λ=±h/(4π) gives unnormalized eigenvectors v₊∝(−i,1) and v₋∝(i,1). After choosing the gauge v₂=1 and normalizing, one obtains v₊=(1/√2)[1,i]ᵀ and v₋=(1/√2)[1,−i]ᵀ. Limitations: each eigenvector is only defined up to an overall (global) complex phase, and the choice v₂=1 is arbitrary; physical predictions are unaffected by that phase. No other subtleties arise for this nondegenerate 2×2 spin-½ operator.; answer: Eigenvalues: +h/(4π), −h/(4π).

For λ=+h/(4π) the equations give v1=−i\u2009v2; choosing v2=1 and normalizing yields v+∝(1,i). For λ=−h/(4π) we get v1=i\u2009v2; choosing v2=1 and normalizing yields v−∝(1,−i).

The results v+∝(1,i)ᵀ and v−∝(1,−i)ᵀ (normalized as v±=(1/sqrt(2))[1,±i]ᵀ) are valid. Limitations: (1) Eigenvectors are only determined up to an overall complex phase—any global phase factor yields an equivalent physical state. (2) This particular form assumes the standard spin-½ basis; choosing a different spin basis or phase convention will change the explicit vectors. (3) The analysis presumes a finite 2D Hilbert space and does not address domain issues of unbounded operators in infinite dimensions.; answer: Eigenvectors: v+ = (1/sqrt(2))[1, i]^T, v− = (1/sqrt(2))[1, −i]^T (each defined only up to a global phase).\nReflexion CoT agent jFLp, refining eigenvectors, thinking: We solve (Ay–λI)v=0 for Ay=(h/4π)[[0,−i],[i,0]] and λ=±h/(4π).

However, they are only fixed up to an overall (global) phase factor and depend on the chosen basis/phase convention. The normalization constant √2 and orthogonality are correct, but without stating a phase convention their form is not unique. Also, this result applies specifically to a spin-½ system in the Pauli matrix representation and assumes no additional physical constraints (e.g. boundary conditions).; answer: v₊=(1/√2)[1, i]ᵀ,\u2002v₋=(1/√2)[1, −i]ᵀ\nReflexion CoT agent jFLp, refining eigenvectors, thinking: To find the eigenvectors, solve (Ay–λI)v=0 for Ay=(h/4π)[[0,−i],[i,0]] and λ=±h/(4π).
