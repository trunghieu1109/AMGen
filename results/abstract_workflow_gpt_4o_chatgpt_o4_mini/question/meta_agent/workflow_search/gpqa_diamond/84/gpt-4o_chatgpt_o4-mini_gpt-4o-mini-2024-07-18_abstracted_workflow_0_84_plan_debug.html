    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 1.05&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 0.98&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 0.53&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1.30&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 4: Compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent LIyO:
The equilibrium temperature ratio Teq1/Teq2 depends on the inverse square root of the orbital distances: Teq∝1/√a. Without numerical values for a1 and a2 (or orbital periods), we cannot compute a definite numerical ratio.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent xf10:
The equilibrium temperature scales as Teq∝1/√a. Orbital speed v=√(GM*/a) so a∝1/v² and Teq∝v. The Doppler shifts give v1/v2=Δλ1/Δλ2=0.03 Å/0.04 Å=0.75, thus Teq1/Teq2=0.75.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent rIiT:
The equilibrium temperature scales as Teq∝1/√a for equal albedo and stellar properties. To get a numerical ratio Teq1/Teq2 we need the semimajor axes a1 and a2 (or orbital periods). Without those values only a symbolic expression can be given.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Cx5Z:
Without the semimajor axes or orbital periods, we cannot compute a numerical ratio. Equilibrium temperature scales as Teq ∝ 1/√a, so the ratio Teq1/Teq2 = √(a2/a1).

### answer #3 by Debate Agent LIyO:
Teq1/Teq2 = √(a2/a1)

Please provide the orbital distances (a1 and a2) or their orbital periods to compute the numerical ratio.

Please provide the orbital distances (a1 and a2) or their orbital periods to compute the numerical ratio.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on temperature ratio.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The equilibrium temperature scales as Teq ∝ 1/√a, and using the Doppler shifts as proxies for orbital speeds (v ∝ Δλ), we get v1/v2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, hence Teq1/Teq2 ≈ 0.75. However, without explicit semimajor axes or orbital periods, this remains an approximation.

Answer:0.75
