Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_84
proposed answer: The equilibrium temperature scales as Teq ∝ 1/√a, and using the Doppler shifts as proxies for orbital speeds (v ∝ Δλ), we get v1/v2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, hence Teq1/Teq2 ≈ 0.75. However, without explicit semimajor axes or orbital periods, this remains an approximation.

Answer:0.75
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the orbital distances (a1 and a2) or their orbital periods to compute the ratio accurately.
