All values are provided directly in the example.; answer: Star: mass = 1.5\u2009M☉; radius = 1.2\u2009R☉; Teff = 6300\u2009K. Planet 1: mass = 7\u2009M⊕; radius = 1.7\u2009R⊕.

For circular orbits K∝Mₚ/(M_*^{2/3}a^{1/2}); since M_* is fixed here, δλ∝Mₚ/√a. For equal‐mass planets this reduces to δλ∝a^{−1/2}, or equivalently a∝(Mₚ/δλ)².; answer: The Doppler‐shift amplitude δλ scales as δλ∝Mₚ/√a (for circular orbits with fixed M_*), so for equal‐mass planets δλ∝a^{−1/2}, equivalently a∝(Mₚ/δλ)².\nCoT-SC agent KYgV, determining Doppler shift relationship, thinking: The radial velocity (or Doppler shift) semi-amplitude K scales as K ∝ m_p\u2009a^(–1/2) (for circular orbits and m_p ≪ M_★). Therefore the orbital distance a scales as a ∝ (m_p/K)^2. Using the given Doppler shifts (K1 ∝0.03\u2009Å, K2 ∝0.04\u2009Å) and masses (m1=7\u2009M⊕, m2=5\u2009M⊕), the ratio a1/a2 = (m1\u2009K2\u2009/\u2009(m2\u2009K1))^2 ≃ (7·0.04\u2009/\u2009(5·0.03))^2 ≃3.5, so Planet\u20091 orbits about √3.5 ≃3.5 times farther out than Planet\u20092.; answer: The Doppler amplitude K ∝ m_p\u2009a^(–1/2), so a ∝ (m_p/K)^2, giving a1/a2 = (7·0.04\u2009/\u2009(5·0.03))^2 ≃3.5.\nCoT-SC agent 0IM9, determining Doppler shift relationship, thinking: The radial velocity (and thus Doppler shift) amplitude K scales as K∝M_p/(M_*^{2/3}P^{1/3}) and via Kepler’s law P∝a^{3/2} gives K∝a^{-1/2}. Since ∆λ∝v_r, the line shift ∆λ∝a^{-1/2}.; answer: The Doppler shift amplitude is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (∆λ ∝ a^{-1/2}).\nReflexion CoT agent MGcl, calculating equilibrium temperatures, thinking: To compute each planet’s equilibrium temperature Teq = Teff * sqrt(R*/(2a)) (assuming zero greenhouse and same albedo), we need the absolute orbital distances a1 and a2 in physical units. We only have their ratio from Doppler shifts, so we can only get the ratio of Teq, not individual Teq values.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the absolute orbital distances (or orbital periods) of the planets so that their equilibrium temperatures can be computed.\nCritic agent 3Lir, providing feedback, thinking: The standard equilibrium‐temperature formula Teq = Teff·√[R*/(2a)]·(1–A)¼ assumes a few key simplifications and missing inputs: 1) It requires the planet’s orbital distance a (or period) to determine the incident flux. Without absolute semimajor axes, you cannot compute individual Teq values—only their ratio if you know the distance ratio. 2) It treats the planet as a perfect blackbody and assumes a constant, uniform albedo A across all wavelengths. 3) It neglects any greenhouse or atmospheric heat‐redistribution effects, meaning real surface temperatures may differ significantly. 4) It assumes instantaneous, isotropic reradiation (no day–night contrast or heat transport). 5) It ignores any internal heat sources (e.g. tidal heating).; answer: Key limitations: missing orbital distances; blackbody assumption; fixed albedo; no greenhouse or circulation; neglect of internal heating.\nReflexion CoT agent MGcl, refining equilibrium temperature calculation, thinking: The equilibrium temperature formula Teq = Teff·√(R*/2a)·(1–A)¼ requires the absolute semimajor axis a for each planet.
