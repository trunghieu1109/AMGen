From P(T≤100)=1−e^{−λ·100}=0.32 one solves λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈0.00386 min⁻¹. Thus survival S(t)=e^{−λt}, mean lifetime 1/λ.; answer: The 32% decay in 100 min implies an exponential (memoryless) process with rate λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹.

However, it relies on idealized assumptions:\n1) True exponential (constant hazard rate) behavior, ignoring any time-dependent or state-dependent effects.\n2) No environmental interactions or external fields that could alter the decay rate.\n3) Perfect detection with zero dead time or missed events.\n4) A single-atom measurement subject to large statistical uncertainty—rate estimates require many trials.\n5) Neglect of quantum Zeno or measurement back-action effects if monitoring is continuous.\nThese factors limit applicability to real experimental setups.; answer: 44%\nReflexion CoT agent kEbV, refining decay probability calculation, thinking: Using the exponential decay model with λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹ and the memoryless property, we get P(decay in next 150 min) = 1 - exp(-λ·150) ≈ 1 - exp(-0.579) ≈ 0.44 or 44%.; answer: C)\nCritic agent luKO, providing feedback, thinking: The chain-of-thought correctly derives the decay constant λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386\u2009min⁻¹ and uses the memoryless property to compute P=1−exp(−λ·150)≈44%.; answer: This result rests on assuming a perfect exponential (memoryless) decay with a constant rate. In practice limitations include: environmental coupling or measurement back-action (quantum Zeno effects) altering the rate; any time-dependence in λ; multiple decay channels; statistical uncertainty in the 32% figure; and finite detection efficiency or timing resolution.\nReflexion CoT agent kEbV, refining decay probability calculation, thinking: Using the exponential decay model (memoryless) with λ = –ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹, the probability of decay in the next 150 min is 1 – exp(–λ·150) ≈ 1 – exp(–0.579) ≈ 0.44.; answer: C)\nCritic agent luKO, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation properly applies an exponential (memoryless) decay model: λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386\u2009min⁻¹, so P=1−exp(−λ·150)≈0.44 (44%).
