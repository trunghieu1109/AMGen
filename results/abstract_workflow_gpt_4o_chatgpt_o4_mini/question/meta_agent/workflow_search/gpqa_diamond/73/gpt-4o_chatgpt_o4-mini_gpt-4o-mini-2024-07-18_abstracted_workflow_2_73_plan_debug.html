    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, choice1=&#39;52%&#39;, choice2=&#39;48%&#39;, choice3=&#39;44%&#39;, choice4=&#39;40%&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Derive the decay constant (λ) from the given probability of 32% decay within 100 minutes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent VDdi:
For an exponential decay, P(decay≤t)=1−e^{−λt}. Given 1−e^{−λ·100}=0.32 ⇒ e^{−100λ}=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent VDdi:
λ = −ln(0.68) / 100 ≈ 0.00386 per minute

### Sub-task 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the first 50 minutes using the decay constant derived in subtask_1. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pTlY:
Using the exponential decay formula P(decay≤t)=1−e^{−λt} with λ≈0.00386/min from subtask 1, for t=50 min we get P=1−e^{−0.00386·50}=1−e^{−0.193}=1−0.8246≈0.1754

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pTlY:
≈17.5%

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the probability of decay in the first 200 minutes (50 minutes already passed + 150 minutes more) using the decay constant. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZH2q:
We derived λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.003856 min⁻¹. Then P(decay≤200)=1−exp(−λ·200)=1−exp(−0.7712)≈1−0.462≈0.538 or 53.8%.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZH2q:
[ERROR]

### Sub-task 4: Apply the concept of conditional probability to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g6ER (yourself):
For an exponential (memoryless) decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 min given survival to 50 min is 1−exp(−λ·150). Using λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.003856 min⁻¹ gives P=1−exp(−0.003856·150)≈1−exp(−0.5784)≈1−0.561≈0.439 or 43.9%.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g6ER (yourself):
44%

### Review conditional probability calculation and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Wqmx:
The solution correctly applies the memoryless property of exponential decay. You first find λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.003856 min⁻¹, then compute P = 1 − exp(−λ·150) ≈ 43.9%, which rounds to 44%. Good work.

### Sub-task 4: Apply the concept of conditional probability to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g6ER (yourself):
For exponential decay with memoryless property, the conditional probability of decay in the next 150 min given survival to 50 min is P=1−exp(−λ·150). Using λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.003856 min⁻¹ gives P≈1−exp(−0.5784)≈0.439≈44%, which corresponds to choice C).

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g6ER (yourself):
C)

### Review conditional probability calculation and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent Wqmx:
The conditional probability calculation is correct. Using the memoryless property of exponential decay, λ = –ln(0.68)/100, so P = 1 – exp(–λ·150) ≈ 44%.

### Sub-task 4: Apply the concept of conditional probability to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g6ER (yourself):
For exponential decay with memoryless property, λ = −ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.003856 min⁻¹, so the probability of decay in the next 150 min given survival to 50 min is 1−exp(−λ·150) ≈ 43.9%, i.e., 44%.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g6ER (yourself):
C)

### Review conditional probability calculation and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent Wqmx:
The calculation correctly applies the memoryless property of exponential decay. You found the decay constant λ = –ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.003856 min⁻¹, then computed P = 1 – e^(–λ·150) ≈ 44%. The reasoning and arithmetic are sound.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Apply the concept of conditional probability to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
