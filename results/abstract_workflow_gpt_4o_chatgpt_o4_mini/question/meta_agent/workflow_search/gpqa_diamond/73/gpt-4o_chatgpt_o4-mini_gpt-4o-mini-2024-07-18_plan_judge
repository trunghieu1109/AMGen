Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_73
proposed answer: The problem uses the memoryless property of exponential decay. Given λ = –ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.003856 min⁻¹, the conditional probability of decay in the next 150 min is 1 – exp(–λ·150) ≈ 1 – exp(–0.5784) ≈ 0.439 ≈ 44%.
