We note that Hooke’s law gives the restoring force and potential energy, while special relativity introduces a velocity limit c and Lorentz-factor modifications to dynamics.; answer: Key physical principles: 1) Hooke’s law (F=–kx) governing the harmonic restoring force and potential energy. 2) Special relativity’s kinematics and dynamics, including the Lorentz factor γ and the cosmic speed limit c.\nCoT-SC agent vb3E, identifying total energy expression, thinking: To write the total energy for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, combine the relativistic kinetic energy m c^2 (γ−1) (or total γ m c^2) with the classical Hooke’s-law potential ½ k x^2. This yields the full energy at any displacement x and velocity v as E=γ m c^2+½ k x^2.; answer: E = γ m c^2 + ½ k x^2, where γ = 1/√(1−v^2/c^2).\nCoT-SC agent j0E9, identifying total energy expression, thinking: The total energy combines the relativistic kinetic energy (including rest energy) via the Lorentz factor and the Hookean potential. Hence the expression is straightforward from Sub‐task 1’s principles.; answer: E = γ\u2009m\u2009c² + ½\u2009k\u2009x², where γ = 1/√(1 – v²/c²)\nCoT-SC agent pi7J, identifying total energy expression, thinking: To write the total energy for a relativistic oscillator, we sum the relativistic kinetic energy (including rest energy) and the potential from Hooke’s law. The Lorentz factor γ=1/√(1–v²/c²) gives the total relativistic energy γmc² (rest\u2009+\u2009kinetic) and the potential is ½kx².; answer: E(x,v)=γmc² + ½kx², equivalently E=√(p²c² + m²c⁴) + ½kx²\nReflexion CoT agent RCqh, determining maximum kinetic energy, thinking: The total energy at maximum amplitude x=A is E_total = m c^2 + ½ k A^2. At x=0, this converts entirely into kinetic energy beyond rest energy: KE_max = E_total − m c^2 = ½ k A^2.; answer: KE_max = ½ k A^2\nCritic agent ztiw, providing feedback, thinking: The expression KE_max = ½\u2009k\u2009A² is formally obtained by equating the total energy at amplitude (mc²\u2009+\u2009½\u2009k\u2009A²) to the kinetic-plus-rest energy at x=0. However, it assumes the spring potential remains purely classical and linear even when ½\u2009k\u2009A² becomes comparable to mc², neglects any relativistic corrections to the spring force or radiation losses, and requires ½\u2009k\u2009A² ≪ mc² so that the stored potential energy is small compared to the rest energy. Should these conditions fail, the Hooke’s‐law energy expression or the notion of a rigid spring may break down.; answer: KE_max = ½\u2009k\u2009A², valid only for ½\u2009k\u2009A² ≪ mc² with a purely classical linear spring and no relativistic spring dynamics or radiative effects.\nReflexion CoT agent RCqh, refining maximum kinetic energy expression, thinking: At maximum amplitude the total energy is mc²+½kA². Converting fully to kinetic at x=0 gives KE_max=E_total−mc²=½kA².; answer: KE_max = ½ k A²\nCritic agent ztiw, providing feedback, thinking: The result KEₘₐₓ=½kA² follows directly from total‐energy conservation (E=γmc²+U) and holds formally even in the relativistic treatment so long as the spring potential remains purely Hookean.  However, this expression implicitly assumes: (1) the force law F=−kx is unmodified at high speeds, (2) instantaneous propagation of the spring force (no retardation), and (3) no energy loss to radiation or field degrees of freedom.  In a fully covariant (field-mediated) spring model or if kA² becomes comparable to mc², these assumptions break down and the simple ½kA² formula may no longer apply.; answer: ½ k A²\nReflexion CoT agent RCqh, refining maximum kinetic energy expression, thinking: At maximum amplitude x=A, total energy E=mc^2+½kA^2. When mass passes through equilibrium x=0, this potential energy is fully converted to kinetic beyond the rest energy, so KE_max=E−mc^2=½kA^2.; answer: KE_max = ½ k A^2\nCritic agent ztiw, providing feedback, thinking: The expression KE_max = ½\u2009k\u2009A² is only valid in the non-relativistic limit where the potential energy U(x)=½\u2009kx² correctly describes the system and k\u2009A² ≪ 2\u2009m\u2009c² so that relativistic corrections to both the mass’s inertia and the restoring force can be ignored. Once k\u2009A² becomes comparable to m\u2009c², the assumptions behind Hooke’s law and the simple U=½\u2009kx² break down and one must use a fully relativistic (covariant) treatment of the oscillator’s Lagrangian and force law, which will modify the KE_max result.; answer: KE_max = ½\u2009k\u2009A²\nReflexion CoT agent RCqh, refining maximum kinetic energy expression, thinking: At maximum amplitude x=A, the total energy is E=mc^2+½kA^2. When the mass passes through equilibrium (x=0), this potential energy is fully converted into kinetic energy beyond the rest energy, giving KE_max=E−mc^2=½kA^2.; answer: KE_max = ½ k A²\nCoT agent WK8l, applying energy-momentum relation, thinking: At maximum amplitude all potential energy ½kA² converts to kinetic: (γ−1)mc²=½kA² ⇒ γ=1+ kA²/(2mc²).
