Since S∝1/a^2, Teq∝a^–1/2. By Kepler’s third law (P^2∝a^3), a∝P^2/3, so Teq∝(P^2/3)^–1/2=P^–1/3.; answer: Teq∝P^(−1/3)\nCoT-SC agent dec1, calculating equilibrium temperature, thinking: To compute an absolute equilibrium temperature we need a reference Teq (or stellar luminosity and orbital distance). Without that, only the P^{-1/3} scaling is possible.; answer: Teq = Teq0 * (P/P0)^(-1/3)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide a reference equilibrium temperature (Teq0) corresponding to a known orbital period P0, or specify the stellar luminosity and planet-star distance to compute absolute Teq.\nCoT-SC agent ZU2s, calculating equilibrium temperature, thinking: We only have the proportionality Teq∝P^(−1/3) from sub-task 1 but lack any normalization constant or stellar/planetary parameters (e.g., stellar luminosity, planet albedo, reference Teq at a known period). Thus we cannot compute an absolute equilibrium temperature.; answer: Teq = Teq_ref × (P/P_ref)^(−1/3)\n[TOO_HARD]\nProvide a reference equilibrium temperature at a known orbital period or the necessary stellar parameters to determine the normalization constant.\nCoT-SC agent V2LX, calculating equilibrium temperature, thinking: Given only the proportional relationship Teq ∝ P^(−1/3), the normalization constant k (dependent on stellar properties and albedo) is unknown, so an absolute equilibrium temperature cannot be calculated.; answer: Teq = k·P^(−1/3)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the stellar luminosity or a reference Teq value to determine the constant k.\nCoT agent 7sBl, applying relationship, thinking: Absolute equilibrium temperatures require a reference Teq0 (or stellar luminosity and planet–star distance).
