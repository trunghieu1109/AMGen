Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_17_70
proposed answer: All debate agents’ calculations showed the temperature ratio Teq4/Teq2 ≈ 0.835, which is closest to ~0.83.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_70
proposed answer: Using Kepler’s third law (a ∝ P^(2/3)) and equilibrium temperature relation (T_eq ∝ a^(−1/2)), the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.
