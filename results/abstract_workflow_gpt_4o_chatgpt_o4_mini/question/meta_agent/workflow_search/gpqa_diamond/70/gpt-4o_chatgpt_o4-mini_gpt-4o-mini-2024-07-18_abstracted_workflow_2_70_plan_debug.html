    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~0.75&#39;, choice2=&#39;~0.83&#39;, choice3=&#39;~0.69&#39;, choice4=&#39;~0.57&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 4: Select the correct choice that matches the calculated temperature ratio. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent RYWT:
Using Kepler’s third law (a ∝ P^(2/3)) and equilibrium temperature relation (T_eq ∝ a^(−1/2)), we find T4/T2=(P2/P4)^(1/3)=(2/3.5)^(1/3)≈0.83.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent RaCy:
Using Kepler’s third law (a ∝ P^(2/3)) and T_eq ∝ a^(−1/2), we get T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, which corresponds to choice B).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent WVBT:
Using Kepler’s third law (a ∝ P^(2/3)) and equilibrium temperature relation (T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)), we get T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

Using Kepler’s third law (a∝P^(2/3)) and equilibrium temperature T_eq∝a^(−1/2), the ratio T4/T2=(P2/P4)^(1/3)=(2/3.5)^(1/3)≈0.83 matches choice B).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
