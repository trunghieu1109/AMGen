The 1H NMR dtq and dtt patterns arise from two methine protons each coupling to one CH3 and one CH2 (ethyl) plus another CH3.

No other major functional groups are evident.; answer: The FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid (broad O–H stretch ~3000\u2009cm⁻¹ and strong C=O stretch ~1700\u2009cm⁻¹).\nCoT agent lxic, analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The complex splitting patterns (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets) indicate two distinct methine protons each coupling to three different sets of neighbours: a CH3 group, a CH2 group, and another CH3. Combined with the broad OH band in the IR and absence of vinyl protons, the molecule must have a carboxylic acid, two CH groups, a CH2 (ethyl), and three CH3 groups. This allows assignment of four types of proton environments.; answer: • Broad singlet: carboxylic acid proton (COOH)\n• Two distinct methine (CH) protons, each showing complex splitting by adjacent CH3 and CH2 groups\n• One methylene (CH2) proton set from the ethyl side chain\n• Three methyl (CH3) groups: two branching off the backbone and one at the end of the ethyl group\nCoT agent khx0, interpreting FTIR peak at 3000, thinking: A broad, strong absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of hydrogen-bonded O–H stretching vibrations, which are typical of carboxylic acids.; answer: The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O–H group (hydrogen-bonded), consistent with a carboxylic acid.\nCoT agent Cqyz, interpreting FTIR peak at 1700, thinking: A strong, sharp absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration in carbonyl-containing compounds (e.g., ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids). In our FTIR data, this peak confirms the presence of a carbonyl group in the unknown compound.; answer: The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration, confirming the presence of a carbonyl group.\nCoT agent fWEk, identifying NMR splitting patterns, thinking: The question asks to identify the splitting patterns in the 1H NMR and interpret the connectivity. We know there are two distinct methine protons each coupling to three different neighbor groups, giving rise to complex multiplets. No vinyl protons or other complicating signals are present, so we can assign each splitting based on coupling constants to CH3 and CH2 groups.; answer: Methine proton A: appears as a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) – the outer doublet arises from coupling to a CH3 group (J≈7 Hz), each triplet from coupling to the CH2 group (J≈6 Hz), and each quartet from coupling to the other CH3 (J≈1–2 Hz). Methine proton B: appears as a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) – the doublet from coupling to one CH3 (J≈7 Hz), one triplet from coupling to the CH2 (J≈6 Hz), and the other triplet from coupling to the second CH3 (J≈1–2 Hz). The CH2 appears as a quartet (q) from the adjacent CH3 (J≈7 Hz) and the CH3 ends as a triplet (t) from the CH2 (J≈7 Hz).\nCoT agent VgCm, confirming carboxylic acid group, thinking: The broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates an O–H stretch and the strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=O stretch; together these are diagnostic of a carboxylic acid group.; answer: The FTIR features—a broad O–H stretch at ~3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong C=O stretch at ~1700 cm⁻¹—confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\nCoT agent Y1Wb, determining absence of vinyl hydrogens, thinking: Vinyl hydrogens resonate around 5–6 ppm and exhibit characteristic splitting; since no signals are observed in that region, vinyl protons are absent.; answer: The lack of any 5–6 ppm signals in the 1H NMR confirms there are no vinyl hydrogens present.\nCoT agent 37zD, analyzing NMR doublet patterns, thinking: The dtq pattern (doublet of triplets of quartets) reflects a methine proton (A) coupling to three distinct neighbors: a CH3 (doublet, J≈7 Hz), a CH2 (triplet, J≈6 Hz), and another CH3 (quartet, J≈1–2 Hz). The dtt pattern (doublet of triplets of triplets) reflects the other methine proton (B) coupling to one CH3 (doublet, J≈7 Hz) and two further groups (one CH2, one CH3) giving two overlapping triplets.; answer: The dtq corresponds to the methine H on the carbon bearing one CH3, one CH2, and another CH3. The dtt corresponds to the methine H on the carbon bearing two CH3 groups and one CH2.\nCoT agent bIR3, assessing compatibility with compound choices, thinking: The FTIR confirms COOH. The 1H NMR dtq and dtt patterns arise from two methine protons each coupling to one CH3 and one CH2 (ethyl) plus another CH3. Only CH3CH2–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH (choice B) provides exactly these environments.; answer: B)\nCoT agent DPyf, selecting best matching compound, thinking: The FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid, and the 1H NMR shows two methine protons each coupling to one CH3 and one CH2 (ethyl) group, giving dtq and dtt patterns.
