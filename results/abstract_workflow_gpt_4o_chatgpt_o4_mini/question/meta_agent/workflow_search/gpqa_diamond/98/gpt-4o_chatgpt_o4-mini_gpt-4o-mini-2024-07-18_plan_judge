Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_98
proposed answer: FTIR confirms a carboxylic acid, but the unique Â¹H NMR pattern (a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets) fits only the two methine environments in CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_98
proposed answer: The FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid, and the 1H NMR shows two methine protons each coupling to one CH3 and one CH2 (ethyl) group, giving dtq and dtt patterns. Only CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH fits these environments.
