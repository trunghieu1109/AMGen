    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, choice1=&#39;~2.25&#39;, choice2=&#39;~2.35&#39;, choice3=&#39;~2.32&#39;, choice4=&#39;~2.23\n&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 4: Select the correct choice that matches the calculated luminosity ratio from the given options. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KGSU:
Since both stars share the same temperature, L∝R²T⁴ gives L₁/L₂=(1.5)²=2.25. Including the Doppler redshift correction for Star₂ reduces this to ≈2.23, matching option D.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent QxdI:
Both stars have the same temperature so by Stefan–Boltzmann law L∝R²T⁴, giving L₁/L₂=(1.5)²=2.25. Accounting for the small Doppler redshift on Star₂ reduces this to ≈2.23, which corresponds to choice D.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ubAh:
Both stars have the same temperature so by Stefan–Boltzmann law L∝R²T⁴, giving L₁/L₂=(1.5)²=2.25. Accounting for the Doppler redshift correction for Star₂ lowers this to ≈2.23, matching choice D.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KCY9:
Both stars have identical temperatures so by Stefan–Boltzmann law L ∝ R²T⁴, giving L₁/L₂=(1.5)²=2.25. Including the small Doppler redshift correction for Star₂ lowers this to ≈2.23, matching choice D.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
