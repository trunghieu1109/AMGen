Therefore a numeric temperature cannot be determined. However, since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures are equal and given by T = b/λ_max.; answer: T1 = T2 = b / λ_max\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the peak wavelength λ_max for a numerical result.\nCoT-SC agent CxjG, expressing luminosity, thinking: Stefan–Boltzmann law gives luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴ for a blackbody of radius R and temperature T.; answer: L₁ = 4π\u2009R₁²\u2009σ\u2009T₁⁴\nL₂ = 4π\u2009R₂²\u2009σ\u2009T₂⁴\nCoT-SC agent yDxF, expressing luminosity, thinking: To express luminosity via Stefan–Boltzmann law, we use L=4πR²σT⁴ for any black-body star. Simply substitute each star’s radius and temperature.; answer: L₁ = 4π\u2009R₁²\u2009σ\u2009T₁⁴\nL₂ = 4π\u2009R₂²\u2009σ\u2009T₂⁴\nCoT-SC agent nbcY, expressing luminosity, thinking: The Stefan–Boltzmann law states that a blackbody’s total power output L is its surface area 4πR^2 times σT^4. Thus each star’s luminosity can be written directly in terms of its radius and temperature.; answer: L1 = 4 π R1^2 σ T1^4; L2 = 4 π R2^2 σ T2^4\nReflexion CoT agent 1ONw, calculating luminosity ratio, thinking: Since both stars have the same temperature (T1=T2), Stefan–Boltzmann gives L∝R²T⁴ so L1/L2=(R1/R2)²( T1/T2)⁴=(1.5)²=2.25; answer: 2.25\nCritic agent lyfA, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation correctly applies the Stefan–Boltzmann law: with T1 = T2 and R1/R2 = 1.5, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.; answer: 2.25\nReflexion CoT agent 1ONw, refining luminosity ratio, thinking: Since both stars have the same temperature, Stefan–Boltzmann law gives L∝R²T⁴. Thus L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²( T₁/T₂)⁴=(1.5)²=2.25.; answer: 2.25\nCritic agent lyfA, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²=2.25 neglects the temperature change due to Star₂’s Doppler redshift. Since Star₂’s emitted peak wavelength is λ_obs/(1+v/c), its true temperature is slightly higher, so (T₁/T₂)⁴≈0.99, giving L₁/L₂≈2.23.; answer: ~2.23\nReflexion CoT agent 1ONw, refining luminosity ratio, thinking: Since both stars have the same temperature, the Stefan–Boltzmann law gives L ∝ R^2 T^4, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.; answer: 2.25\nCritic agent lyfA, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation is correct. Since both stars have the same temperature, the Stefan–Boltzmann law gives L ∝ R²T⁴, so L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent 1ONw, refining luminosity ratio, thinking: Both stars have the same temperature (identical peak wavelength) so via Stefan–Boltzmann, L∝R²T⁴ and L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²=(1.5)²=2.25.
