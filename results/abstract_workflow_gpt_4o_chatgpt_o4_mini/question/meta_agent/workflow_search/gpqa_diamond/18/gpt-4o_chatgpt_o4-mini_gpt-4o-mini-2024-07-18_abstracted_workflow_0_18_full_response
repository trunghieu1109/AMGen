The β-keto ester methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate is deprotonated by NaOEt in THF to give an enolate nucleophile, while 2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene is a vinyl sulfoxide Michael acceptor. NaOEt acts as the base and THF as the solvent.; answer: The components are:\n1) Methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate: a β-keto ester that, under NaOEt in THF, forms the enolate nucleophile.\n2) 2,4-Dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene: a vinyl sulfoxide acting as the Michael acceptor.\n3) NaOEt: the base for enolate generation.\n4) THF: the inert polar aprotic solvent.\nCoT agent WQ8y, identifying components of second reaction, thinking: The question asks for characterization of components in the second reaction—no MCQ—so I’ll describe the roles of each reagent.; answer: Ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate: an enolizable ester pronucleophile that, upon deprotonation, forms an enolate. NaH: a strong, non-nucleophilic base used to deprotonate the ester alpha-carbon. THF: a polar aprotic solvent that stabilizes the enolate and dissolves both reagents.
