    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;doublet of triplets&#39;, choice2=&#39;triplet of triplets&#39;, choice3=&#39;pentet&#39;, choice4=&#39;triplet&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on coupling pattern. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent feOX:
The bridgehead proton adjacent to the carbonyl couples to two distinct sets of inequivalent methylene protons with different J values, yielding a triplet of triplets.

### answer by Final Decision Agent feOX:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Select the correct coupling pattern from the given choices based on the analysis of the NMR spectrum.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
