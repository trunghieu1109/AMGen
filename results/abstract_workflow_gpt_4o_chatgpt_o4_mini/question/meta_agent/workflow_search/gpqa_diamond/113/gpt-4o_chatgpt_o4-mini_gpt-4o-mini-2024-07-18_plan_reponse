        "response": "The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires protonation of the \u2013C\u2261N to activate it towards nucleophilic attack by water. A strong acid like HCl effectively protonates the nitrile and facilitates the hydration step. Although harsher conditions can lead to side reactions (partial amide formation, dehydration of adjacent alcohols) and require careful pH control, HCl remains the most efficient catalyst for complete nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nAnswer:B)",
