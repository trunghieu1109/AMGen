Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_113
proposed answer: The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires protonation of the –C≡N to activate it towards nucleophilic attack by water. A strong acid like HCl effectively protonates the nitrile and facilitates the hydration step. Although harsher conditions can lead to side reactions (partial amide formation, dehydration of adjacent alcohols) and require careful pH control, HCl remains the most efficient catalyst for complete nitrile hydrolysis.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_113
proposed answer: Reagent A protonates the alkoxide to form the cyanohydrin, requiring a strong acid source like H3O⁺, and reagent B must strongly acid‐catalyze nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, requiring HCl. The only matching choice is D).
