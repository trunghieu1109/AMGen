This is a nucleophilic addition reaction specifically known as cyanohydrin formation.; answer: Cyanohydrin formation (nucleophilic addition)\nCoT-SC agent shkx, determining role of reagent A, thinking: The cyanohydrin formation mechanism requires protonation of the alkoxide intermediate. Reagent A must thus be a proton donor to convert the alkoxide to the cyanohydrin. Common proton sources include strong acids (H3O+, HCl) or even weaker acids (HOAc).; answer: Reagent A acts as a proton donor to protonate the alkoxide and form the cyanohydrin. Suitable candidates include H3O+, dilute HCl or acetic acid.\nCoT-SC agent AKUy, determining role of reagent A, thinking: The first step is cyanohydrin formation: CN– attacks the ketone to give an alkoxide, which then must be protonated. Reagent A therefore provides the proton source (acidic work‐up). Suitable choices include aqueous acids such as H₃O⁺, dilute HCl or H₂SO₄ (even organic acids like acetic acid can be used, though stronger acids give better yields).; answer: Reagent A acts as the proton donor to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Suitable candidates include H₃O⁺ (aqueous acid), dilute HCl or H₂SO₄.\nCoT-SC agent HXbl, determining role of reagent A, thinking: The first step is cyanohydrin formation: CN– attacks the carbonyl to give an alkoxide, which must be protonated. Reagent A therefore acts as a proton donor (acid catalyst).; answer: Reagent A serves as the proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate in cyanohydrin formation. Suitable candidates include dilute mineral acids (e.g. HCl, H₂SO₄), aqueous H₃O⁺, or weak acids such as acetic acid.\nCoT agent Yf3b, identifying reaction type, thinking: The transformation converts a nitrile to a carboxylic acid via addition of water and acid catalysis. This is a classic nitrile hydrolysis (acid-catalyzed) reaction.; answer: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a nitrile to give a carboxylic acid\nCoT-SC agent I41p, determining role of reagent B, thinking: The second reaction involves converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid by adding water under acidic conditions. Reagent B must supply protons to catalyze the hydrolysis of the –C≡N into –COOH.; answer: The role of B is as an acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. Suitable candidates include dilute HCl, dilute H₂SO₄, or aqueous H₃O⁺.\nCoT-SC agent 0una, determining role of reagent B, thinking: Reagent B provides the acidic (or occasionally basic) conditions and water needed to hydrolyze the –C≡N group to –CO₂H. In practice one uses aqueous acid (or base) under heating to convert a nitrile into a carboxylic acid.; answer: B acts as the acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. Suitable candidates include aqueous HCl, H₂SO₄, or H₃O⁺ (e.g. 1 M HCl, dilute H₂SO₄, or acidic work-up with H₃O⁺).\nCoT-SC agent Jp1u, determining role of reagent B, thinking: Reagent B is the acid catalyst needed to protonate the nitrile and facilitate its hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. Common strong acids or their aqueous solutions serve this role.; answer: Reagent B acts as the acid catalyst in nitrile hydrolysis; suitable candidates include HCl, H₂SO₄, or aqueous H₃O⁺.\nDebate agent AEzF, round 0, evaluating compatibility, thinking: For cyanohydrin formation (first reaction), A must be an acid: H3O+, HCl, or acetic acid are acceptable, but NaHSO3 is not. For nitrile hydrolysis (second reaction), B must be a strong acid catalyst; CH3COOH is too weak, whereas HCl is suitable. The only choice matching A = H3O+ and B = HCl is choice 4.; answer: D)\nDebate agent HtDw, round 0, evaluating compatibility, thinking: Reagent A must protonate the alkoxide to form the cyanohydrin, so H3O+ or HCl or HOAc work; reagent B must acid-catalyze nitrile hydrolysis, so strong acids like HCl or H3O+ are suitable. Among choices, only A = H3O+ and B = HCl meets both requirements.; answer: D)\nDebate agent 4kOv, round 0, evaluating compatibility, thinking: Reagent A must provide protons to form the cyanohydrin, so H₃O⁺ is appropriate. Reagent B must catalyze nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, requiring a stronger acid like HCl rather than weak CH₃COOH.
