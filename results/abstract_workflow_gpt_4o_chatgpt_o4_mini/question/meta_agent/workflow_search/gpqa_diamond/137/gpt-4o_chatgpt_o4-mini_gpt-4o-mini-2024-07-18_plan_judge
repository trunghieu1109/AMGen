Question: Example(question='A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ', choice1='The increased pressure of the solution', choice2='The increased volume of the solution ', choice3='The increased temperature of the solution', choice4='The increased pH of the solution', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_137
proposed answer: The rate-determining step is acid-catalyzed, so the reaction rate depends directly on proton concentration. Raising the pH from 1 to 4 reduces [H⁺] by a factor of 10³ and thus slows the rate dramatically. Temperature rise would accelerate the reaction, and changes in volume or pressure at constant concentration have minor effects.

Answer:Raising the pH from 1 to 4 lowers [H⁺] by 10³, greatly reducing the rate of this acid-catalyzed reaction.
Extracted answer: Raising the pH from 1 to 4 lowers [H⁺] by 10³, greatly reducing the rate of this acid-catalyzed reaction.
Correct answer: 3
