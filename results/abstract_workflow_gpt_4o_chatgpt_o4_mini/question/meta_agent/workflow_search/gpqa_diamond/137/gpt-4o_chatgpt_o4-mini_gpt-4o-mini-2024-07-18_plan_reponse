        "response": "The rate-determining step is acid-catalyzed, so the reaction rate depends directly on proton concentration. Raising the pH from 1 to 4 reduces [H\u207a] by a factor of 10\u00b3 and thus slows the rate dramatically. Temperature rise would accelerate the reaction, and changes in volume or pressure at constant concentration have minor effects.\n\nAnswer:Raising the pH from 1 to 4 lowers [H\u207a] by 10\u00b3, greatly reducing the rate of this acid-catalyzed reaction.",
