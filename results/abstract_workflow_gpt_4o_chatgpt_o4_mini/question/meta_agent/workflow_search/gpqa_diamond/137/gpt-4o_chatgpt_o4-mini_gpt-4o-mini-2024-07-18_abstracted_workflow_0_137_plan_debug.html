    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? &#39;, choice1=&#39;The increased pressure of the solution&#39;, choice2=&#39;The increased volume of the solution &#39;, choice3=&#39;The increased temperature of the solution&#39;, choice4=&#39;The increased pH of the solution&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the most likely factor responsible for the change in reaction rate. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent FjIm:
The reaction is acid-catalyzed; raising the pH from 1 to 4 reduces the proton concentration by about 10^3, dramatically slowing the rate, whereas temperature rise would speed it and pressure/volume changes are negligible.

### answer by Final Decision Agent FjIm:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Justify why the increased pH of the solution is the most plausible reason for the change in reaction rate.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The rate-determining step is acid-catalyzed, so the reaction rate depends directly on proton concentration. Raising the pH from 1 to 4 reduces [H⁺] by a factor of 10³ and thus slows the rate dramatically. Temperature rise would accelerate the reaction, and changes in volume or pressure at constant concentration have minor effects.

Answer:Raising the pH from 1 to 4 lowers [H⁺] by 10³, greatly reducing the rate of this acid-catalyzed reaction.</pre>
