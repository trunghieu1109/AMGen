No extra data is needed beyond the rest wavelength and a chosen redshift (e.g., z=1.9).; answer: observed_wavelength = (1 + z) * 1216 Å. For example, at z = 1.9: λ ≈ (1 + 1.9) × 1216 Å ≈ 3526 Å.\nCoT agent 3fyF, determining optical range, thinking: Optical ground-based telescopes typically operate from the near-UV cutoff of the atmosphere around 3800 Å up through the red into about 7500 Å before infrared detectors are needed.; answer: 3800 to 7500 Angstroms\nReflexion CoT agent 8QlT, setting up inequality, thinking: We directly apply the condition that the redshifted Lyman α line must lie above the atmospheric cutoff of 3800 Å: (1+z)×1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å, then solve for z.; answer: (1 + z) * 1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å ⇒ z ≥ (3800/1216) – 1 ≈ 2.125\nCritic agent ccrT, providing feedback, thinking: The inequality (1+z)·1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å is set up correctly to ensure the redshifted Ly α line is in the optical band.; answer: (1+z)·1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å ⇒ z ≥ 3800/1216 − 1 ≈ 2.125\nReflexion CoT agent 8QlT, refining inequality setup, thinking: We require the redshifted Lyman-α line to exceed the atmospheric cutoff at 3800\u2009Å. Using observed_wavelength = (1+z)×1216\u2009Å, we set up the inequality and solve for z.; answer: (1+z)×1216\u2009Å ≥ 3800\u2009Å ⇒ z ≥ (3800/1216) − 1 ≈ 2.125\nCritic agent ccrT, providing feedback, thinking: The inequality is set up correctly: you require (1 + z) × 1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å, which indeed yields z ≥ (3800/1216) – 1 ≃ 2.125. This is the proper lower limit for the Lyman-α line to enter the optical window at the atmospheric cutoff.; answer: z ≥ 2.125\nReflexion CoT agent 8QlT, refining inequality setup, thinking: To ensure the Ly α line enters the optical window, use observed_wavelength = (1+z)×1216\u2009Å and require this ≥3800\u2009Å, then solve for z.; answer: (1 + z) × 1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å ⇒ z ≥ (3800/1216) − 1 ≈ 2.125\nCritic agent ccrT, providing feedback, thinking: The inequality (1+z)×1216\u2009Å ≥ 3800\u2009Å is set up correctly to find the minimum redshift for Lyα to enter the optical window.; answer: Solving gives z ≥ (3800/1216) − 1 ≈ 2.12, so the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.1.\nReflexion CoT agent 8QlT, refining inequality setup, thinking: The prompt requests a multiple-choice alphabet response, but this sub-task is not framed as a choice among A–D.
