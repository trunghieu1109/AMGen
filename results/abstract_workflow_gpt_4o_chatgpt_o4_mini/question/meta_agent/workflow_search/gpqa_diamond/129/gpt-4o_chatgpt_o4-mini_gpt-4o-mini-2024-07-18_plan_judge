Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_129
proposed answer: We use the relation λ_obs=(1+z)·1216 Å and require λ_obs to lie above the optical/atmospheric blue cutoff (≈3000–3500 Å). Solving gives the base limit z≃(3000/1216)–1≈1.47, and accounting for a more realistic cutoff near 3200–3500 Å pushes the practical lower bound to z≳1.6–1.9. However, precise values depend on the telescope’s UV sensitivity curve, detector throughput, and atmospheric transmission at the specific site.

Answer:Approximately z ≳1.5 (realistically z ≳1.6–1.9)
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the telescope’s blue-cutoff wavelength and instrument throughput curve for a firm lower‐limit estimate.
Extracted answer: Approximately z ≳1.5 (realistically z ≳1.6–1.9)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_129
proposed answer: Starting from the inequality (1 + z) * 1216 Å ≥ 3800 Å, we divide both sides by 1216 Å to get 1 + z ≥ 3800/1216 ≃ 3.125. Subtracting 1 yields z ≥ 2.125.

Answer:z ≥ 2.125
