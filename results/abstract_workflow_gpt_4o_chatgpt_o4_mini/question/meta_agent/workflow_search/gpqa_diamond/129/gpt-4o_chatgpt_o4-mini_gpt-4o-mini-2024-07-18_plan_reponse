Solving gives the base limit z\u2243(3000/1216)\u20131\u22481.47, and accounting for a more realistic cutoff near 3200\u20133500\u2009\u00c5 pushes the practical lower bound to z\u22731.6\u20131.9. However, precise values depend on the telescope\u2019s UV sensitivity curve, detector throughput, and atmospheric transmission at the specific site.\n\nAnswer:Approximately z \u22731.5 (realistically z \u22731.6\u20131.9)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the telescope\u2019s blue-cutoff wavelength and instrument throughput curve for a firm lower\u2010limit estimate.",
