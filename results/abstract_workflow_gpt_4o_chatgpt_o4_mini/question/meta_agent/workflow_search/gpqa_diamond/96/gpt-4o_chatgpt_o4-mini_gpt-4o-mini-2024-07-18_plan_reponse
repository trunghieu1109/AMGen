            "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys.

        "response": "The question asks to apply the mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation via post-zygotic histone methylation to explain why XXY individuals are less severely affected than trisomy 21. The key point is that extra X-linked genes are largely silenced by dosage compensation, whereas no similar global silencing exists for the extra chromosome 21.\n\nAnswer:In Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, the extra X chromosome is inactivated early in embryogenesis through XIST-mediated recruitment of histone methyltransferases, which deposit repressive marks across one X, restoring near-normal X-linked gene dosage. In contrast, trisomy 21 lacks any chromosome-wide inactivation mechanism, so genes on the extra chromosome 21 remain expressed at 150% of normal levels, producing more severe phenotypes.",
