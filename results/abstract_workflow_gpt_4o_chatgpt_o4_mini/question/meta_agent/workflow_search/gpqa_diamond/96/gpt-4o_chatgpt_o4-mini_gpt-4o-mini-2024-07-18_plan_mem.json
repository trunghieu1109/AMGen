        "In Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, the extra X chromosome is inactivated early in embryogenesis through XIST-mediated recruitment of histone methyltransferases, which deposit repressive marks across one X, restoring near-normal X-linked gene dosage. In contrast, trisomy 21 lacks any chromosome-wide inactivation mechanism, so genes on the extra chromosome 21 remain expressed at 150% of normal levels, producing more severe phenotypes.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
