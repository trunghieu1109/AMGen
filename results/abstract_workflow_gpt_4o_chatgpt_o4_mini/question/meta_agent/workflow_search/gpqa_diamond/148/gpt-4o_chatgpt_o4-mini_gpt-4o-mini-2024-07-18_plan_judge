Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_148
proposed answer: Subtasks 3, 5, and 6 rule out enantiomers, double coupling, and contamination, respectively, while subtask 4 supports the presence of diastereoisomers as the only explanation consistent with equal-intensity NMR and identical-mass LC-MS peaks.

proposed answer: The duplicate α‐proton peaks with equal integrals and two LC peaks of identical mass indicate two stereoisomers in distinct environments but same mass. Diastereomers fit this pattern, while enantiomers would not separate on achiral LC, and other hypotheses don’t explain both NMR and LC-MS data.
