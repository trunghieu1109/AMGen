This implies two distinct, slowly interconverting species in solution. Combined with MS showing identical mass and LC peaks, the most likely cause is formation of two stereoisomers (diastereomers) via epimerization at the α-center, not enantiomers, contamination, or double coupling.; answer: The duplicate α-proton peaks reflect two diastereomeric forms (epimers) in slow exchange.\nCoT agent h4z8, analyzing LC-MS data, thinking: The two LC-MS peaks have identical mass spectra and equal intensity, ruling out different compounds or contamination. Under elevated temperature they remain separate, indicating slow interconversion between two species of the same composition; this is characteristic of conformational isomers such as cis/trans amide rotamers, which behave as diastereoisomers in NMR and LC.; answer: The two peaks represent two conformational diastereomers (cis/trans amide rotamers) of the same molecule, which interconvert too slowly to coalesce under the experimental conditions.\nCoT-SC agent kxl4, applying stereochemistry knowledge, thinking: Enantiomers in an achiral environment (NMR solvent, achiral LC) have identical chemical shifts and retention, so they would not give separate peaks. Diastereoisomers, including cis/trans amide rotamers or epimers at the α‐carbon, have different physical properties, leading to distinct NMR signals and LC peaks. Slow interconversion preserves two separate species.; answer: The data reflect two diastereoisomeric forms (e.g., cis/trans amide rotamers), not enantiomers.\nCoT-SC agent jqwR, applying stereochemistry knowledge, thinking: Enantiomers are mirror images and in an achiral solvent give identical NMR chemical shifts and coelute in achiral LC; they’d be indistinguishable by standard 1H NMR and LC-MS without a chiral selector. Diastereomers, however, have different spatial arrangements around stereocenters (or cis/trans amide bonds), so they produce separate signals in NMR and can elute as distinct peaks in LC. The equal integrals and identical mass indicate the same molecular formula but different stereochemical environments. Slow interconversion under the conditions preserves both species, leading to duplicated α-proton signals and two LC peaks with identical MS.; answer: The data are explained by a mixture of diastereoisomers (e.g., amide rotamers or epimers) that interconvert too slowly to merge in the NMR or LC-MS analyses.\nCoT-SC agent W1nd, applying stereochemistry knowledge, thinking: Enantiomers are mirror images and in an achiral environment (standard NMR solvent, LC column) give identical chemical shifts and retention times; they would not split into two separate peaks. Diastereoisomers (including amide rotamers or epimers at the α‐center) have different spatial arrangements, thus distinct NMR signals and chromatographic behavior. Slow interconversion on the NMR/LC timescale yields two sets of identical‐mass signals.; answer: The duplicated α‐proton signals and equal‐intensity LC peaks arise from a pair of diastereoisomers (e.g., cis/trans amide rotamers or epimers at the α‐center) that interconvert too slowly to coalesce under the experimental conditions.\nCoT agent HCDq, evaluating double coupling impact, thinking: Double coupling in an amide‐bond forming reaction would involve a single amine coupling twice to two activated carboxyl groups, yielding a dipeptide side‐product or branched peptide. Such a side‐product would have a different molecular weight and additional unique NMR signals beyond just a duplicated α‐proton, and LC–MS would show a distinct mass peak. The observed two peaks have identical mass spectra and sum to the correct integral, ruling out a double coupling impurity.; answer: Double coupling is not consistent with the NMR and LC–MS data; it would give a different mass and additional signals rather than two identical species.\nCoT agent dX98, assessing contamination likelihood, thinking: Contamination with a precursor would produce additional NMR signals that do not sum correctly to the expected integral and yield a different mass by LC–MS. Here both peaks integrate to the correct total and share the same mass spectrum, so precursor contamination is highly unlikely.; answer: Contamination with a precursor is very unlikely, as this would give extra NMR peaks and a different mass in LC–MS, neither of which is observed.\nCoT agent yfkE, extracting features for diastereoisomers, thinking: Diastereoisomers have different physical environments leading to separate NMR signals and chromatographic behavior, but identical masses. The observation of two alpha‐proton peaks with equal integrals and similar shifts (ruling out coupling), plus two equal‐intensity LC peaks with the same MS, matches slow‐interconverting diastereoisomers.; answer: — Two distinct NMR signals for the same α‐proton (equal integrals, similar shifts)\n— No coupling pattern to explain duplication (rules out spin–spin splitting)\n— Two separate LC peaks of equal intensity at elevated temperature\n— Identical mass spectra for both peaks\n— Slow interconversion on the NMR and LC timescales\nCoT agent ZcdI, extracting features for double coupling, thinking: Double coupling in an amide‐bond formation would generate a branched or extended side‐product with a distinct molecular weight and extra proton environments. As a result, one would expect: (1) an additional m/z peak in the LC-MS corresponding to the di-coupled product; (2) new or shifted NMR resonances beyond the single duplicated α-proton signal—particularly extra amide NH and α-/β-protons; (3) altered integration patterns summing to >1H for the duplicated regions; (4) distinctive coupling patterns from the new stereocenters or branch points.; answer: Additional m/z peak for the branched/double-coupled product; extra NMR signals (amide NH, α- and side-chain protons) beyond the single duplicated α-proton; integrations exceeding expected values; altered coupling patterns from the new linkage\nCoT agent h1vj, extracting features for contamination, thinking: To identify precursor contamination, look for signals/features inconsistent with the pure target: extra NMR resonances unaccounted for by the expected structure, mismatched integrals, and LC-MS peaks at the precursor’s m/z or distinct retention times. These markers contrast with the uniform data of a single pure compound.; answer: Defining features indicating precursor contamination:\n1. NMR Indicators:\n   – Extra peaks: Resonances not assignable to expected protons of the target molecule.\n   – Integral discrepancies: Total integrals exceed or mismatch the predicted proton count.\n   – Unusual coupling patterns: Multiplets or J-values characteristic of the precursor’s distinct spin system.\n   – Chemical shift anomalies: Resonances at shifts known for functional groups present only in the precursor.\n2. LC-MS Indicators:\n   – Additional m/z signals: Peaks matching the molecular weight (or fragments) of the precursor.\n   – Multiple chromatographic peaks: Distinct retention times for precursor vs. target.\n   – Relative intensities: Significant signal from the precursor mass peak (typically >5–10% of the target).\nCoT agent HF1B, assessing diastereoisomer impact, thinking: Diastereoisomers occupy distinct stereochemical environments, causing separate NMR signals for the same proton and distinct chromatographic retention times, yet they share identical mass spectra. The observed duplicate α-proton peaks (equal integrals, similar shifts) and two equal-intensity LC peaks with the same MS fit this behavior, indicating slow interconversion on both NMR and LC timescales.; answer: The presence of diastereoisomers perfectly explains the duplicated α-proton signals and dual LC-MS peaks with identical mass spectra, so the observations align with diastereoisomer formation.\nCoT agent 8NH7, assessing double coupling impact, thinking: Double coupling in an amide‐bond formation would generate a product of different mass (extra m/z peak) and additional NMR resonances beyond the duplicated α‐proton. Since the LC‐MS shows only two peaks of identical mass and the NMR has no extra signals or increased integrals, double coupling does not match the data.; answer: Double coupling does not align with the observed NMR and LC-MS data.\nCoT agent kpf4, assessing contamination impact, thinking: Precursor contamination would produce extra NMR resonances not accounted for by the target, mismatched integrals, and additional m/z signals or distinct LC retention times. Here the alpha‐proton integrals sum correctly to 1\u2009H, no unexpected chemical shifts appear, and both LC peaks share the same mass. Thus precursor contamination is inconsistent with the observed NMR and LC–MS data.; answer: Precursor contamination is unlikely, as it would introduce extra NMR signals and additional LC–MS m/z peaks at different retention times, which are not observed.\nDebate agent e67B, round 0, selecting most likely explanation, thinking: Diastereoisomers occupy distinct stereochemical environments, causing separate NMR signals for the same proton and distinct LC retention times while sharing identical mass spectra.
