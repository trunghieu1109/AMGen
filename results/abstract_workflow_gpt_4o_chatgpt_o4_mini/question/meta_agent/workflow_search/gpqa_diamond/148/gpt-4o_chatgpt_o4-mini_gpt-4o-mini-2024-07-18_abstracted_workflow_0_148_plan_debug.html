    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?&#39;, choice1=&#39;The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers&#39;, choice2=&#39;The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers&#39;, choice3=&#34;&#39;Double coupling&#39; has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction&#34;, choice4=&#39;The compound is contaminated with a precursor&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the evaluations from subtasks 3, 4, 5, and 6 to select the most plausible explanation for the observed data. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent K7gj:
Subtask 3 rules out enantiomers; subtasks 5 and 6 rule out double coupling and contamination; subtask 4 supports diastereoisomers; therefore the most plausible explanation is a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ytSZ:
Enantiomers would not be resolved in achiral NMR or LC-MS conditions (subtask 3), double coupling would change mass and integrals (subtask 5), and precursor contamination would give different mass or unmatched integrals (subtask 6). Only diastereoisomers explain the observed duplicate but equal-intensity NMR peaks and identical-mass LC-MS peaks.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent iPX4:
Enantiomers are not resolved under achiral conditions (subtask 3), double coupling would alter mass/integrals (subtask 5), and precursor contamination would change mass/signals (subtask 6). Only diastereoisomers explain the duplicate yet equal-intensity NMR and LC-MS peaks with identical mass and correct integration (subtask 4).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent vqUy:
Enantiomers would not be resolved under achiral NMR/LC conditions; double coupling would change mass or integrals; precursor contamination would give a different mass or extra signals. Only a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers explains two equal-intensity NMR peaks and two LC peaks with identical mass.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on the most plausible explanation.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
