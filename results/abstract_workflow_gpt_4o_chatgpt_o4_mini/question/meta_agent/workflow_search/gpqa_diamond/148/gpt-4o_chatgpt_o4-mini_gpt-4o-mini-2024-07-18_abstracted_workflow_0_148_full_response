Since LC–MS shows the same mass for both peaks, they are not different compounds but rather stereoisomers (epimers or rotamers) whose alpha‐proton environments are non‐equivalent.; answer: The two peaks reflect two distinct stereochemical environments for the alpha‐proton, indicating the presence of two diastereomeric (or conformationally locked rotameric) forms in roughly equal amounts.\nCoT agent y1Qg, interpreting LC-MS results, thinking: The LC–MS shows two chromatographic peaks of equal intensity but identical mass spectra, which means both species have the same molecular formula. This pattern is characteristic of stereoisomers (e.g., diastereomers or conformers) that are separable by LC but indistinguishable by MS.; answer: The two LC–MS peaks represent isomeric forms of the same molecule (same mass) present in a 1:1 ratio, most likely stereoisomers such as diastereomers or amide rotamers.\nCoT-SC agent GSZF, evaluating enantiomers, thinking: Enantiomers are identical in achiral NMR solvents and give the same retention on an achiral LC column, so they would not produce two separate NMR signals or two distinct LC peaks. The observed duplications thus cannot arise from enantiomers but rather from diastereomers or conformers.; answer: The compound is not a mixture of enantiomers; enantiomers would not be resolved in the NMR or LC-MS conditions used.\nCoT-SC agent auJK, evaluating enantiomers, thinking: Enantiomers are mirror images that have identical NMR spectra (including chemical shifts and coupling patterns) and cannot be separated on an achiral LC column, yet we observe two resolved peaks in both NMR and LC-MS with identical mass. This rules out an enantiomeric mixture.; answer: It’s unlikely to be a mixture of enantiomers; the data instead indicate diastereomers or conformational isomers.\nCoT-SC agent 57Sk, evaluating enantiomers, thinking: Enantiomers have identical chemical environments and masses and are indistinguishable by NMR and achiral LC–MS; they would give a single NMR signal and one chromatographic peak, not two separate peaks.; answer: The compound is unlikely a mixture of enantiomers; enantiomeric mixtures wouldn’t produce two distinct NMR or LC–MS peaks under achiral conditions.\nCoT-SC agent dSoy, evaluating diastereoisomers, thinking: The presence of two separate but equal‐intensity NMR signals for the same α–proton, together integrating to one proton and showing no coupling artifacts, indicates two distinct stereochemical environments in slow exchange. The LC‐MS chromatogram displaying two peaks of equal intensity but identical mass further confirms the species have the same molecular formula. Since enantiomers are NMR‐ and LC‐silent without a chiral environment, the observed separation must arise from diastereomeric (or conformationally locked amide-rotameric) forms. Thus the data are best explained by a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers.; answer: The data strongly support that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\nCoT-SC agent 5wIQ, evaluating diastereoisomers, thinking: The observation of two distinct but equivalent NMR signals for the same α-proton, combined with two LC peaks of identical mass in a 1:1 ratio, indicates the presence of two stereochemical variants of the same molecule that are separable by LC yet indistinguishable by MS. This is characteristic of diastereoisomers (or locked rotamers) rather than simple enantiomers or impurities. No coupling artifacts explain the duplicate peaks, and the mass data rule out contamination. Thus the data strongly support a mixture of diastereoisomers.; answer: The data are consistent with a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers.\nCoT-SC agent WGdq, evaluating diastereoisomers, thinking: The observation of two separate but equal‐integral NMR signals for the same alpha proton, coupled with two LC peaks showing identical mass spectra and equal intensities, indicates two species of the same molecular formula in slow exchange. This pattern is characteristic of stereoisomers with different chemical environments—most likely diastereoisomers (or conformationally locked rotamers)—rather than enantiomers or impurities.; answer: A mixture of diastereoisomers is the most likely explanation.\nCoT-SC agent GIFn, assessing double coupling, thinking: Double coupling during an amide-bond formation would add an extra amide and change the molecular mass, and NMR integrals would reflect more than one alpha-proton environment per molecule. The observed LC-MS shows the exact expected mass twice (no extra coupling product), and NMR integration sums correctly to one alpha proton. Hence double coupling cannot explain these data.; answer: Double coupling is highly unlikely given the NMR integrals and identical mass spectra; it does not account for the observed phenomena.\nCoT-SC agent KbDa, assessing double coupling, thinking: Double coupling refers to repeating the amide‐bond formation step to drive reaction completeness, not to generating two species with identical mass but different stereochemical or conformational states. The presence of two NMR peaks for the same proton and two LC peaks with identical MS data points to isomerism (diastereomers or rotamers) rather than a synthetic artifact like double coupling.; answer: Double coupling is highly unlikely to explain the observations.\nCoT-SC agent IoY3, assessing double coupling, thinking: Double coupling during an amide‐bond formation would generate a byproduct with an extra coupling partner (e.g. a diamide) or other mass variant. Our LC–MS shows two peaks of identical mass matching the target, and no additional masses or unexpected integrals appear in the NMR. Therefore there is no evidence for a double‐coupled impurity.; answer: It is highly unlikely that double coupling occurred; the data instead support stereoisomeric forms rather than a double‐coupling side product.\nCoT-SC agent OQpA, evaluating contamination, thinking: Contamination with a precursor would produce a different molecular mass in MS and additional NMR signals not matching the expected integrals. Here both LC–MS peaks show identical mass spectra and the combined NMR integral matches one proton. Thus precursor contamination cannot account for the data.; answer: Contamination with a precursor cannot explain the observed NMR and LC–MS results.\nCoT-SC agent ca9f, evaluating contamination, thinking: If a precursor were present, it would have a different molecular weight or additional NMR signals beyond the single alpha-proton split into two peaks. The LC-MS shows both species have identical mass, and the NMR integrates to exactly one alpha-proton (split into two environments), without extra resonances from a precursor. Thus contamination with a precursor cannot explain the data.; answer: Contamination with a precursor is unlikely because it would yield different masses or additional NMR signals, which are not observed.\nCoT-SC agent ARFz, evaluating contamination, thinking: A precursor impurity would have a different molecular weight and distinct NMR signals; here both LC peaks give the same MS and NMR integrals match one peptide. Therefore contamination by a precursor is inconsistent with identical mass and integral data.; answer: Contamination with a precursor is highly unlikely to explain the observed NMR and LC–MS data.\nDebate agent K7gj, round 0, selecting plausible explanation, thinking: Enantiomers would not give separate NMR or LC peaks in achiral conditions; double coupling or contamination alter mass or integrals, which is not observed.
