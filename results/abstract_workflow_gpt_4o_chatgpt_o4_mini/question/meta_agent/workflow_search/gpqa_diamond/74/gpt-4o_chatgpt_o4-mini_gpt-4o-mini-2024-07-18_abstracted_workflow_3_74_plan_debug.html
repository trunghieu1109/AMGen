    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene&#39;s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5&#39;ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3&#39;\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.&#34;, choice1=&#39;The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain&#39;, choice2=&#39;The ribosome terminated the translation early&#39;, choice3=&#39;The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation&#39;, choice4=&#39;The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Derive a quantitative measure of the impact of the identified discrepancy on protein expression levels, using experimental data or simulations if available. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ty0j:
The question asks for a quantitative measure but no experimental or simulation data have been provided. I can outline the typical approach and expected magnitude but cannot calculate a precise value without actual measurements. Therefore, I must flag this as too difficult given missing data and request the needed information.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ty0j:
Without specific densitometry or mass‐spectrometry data comparing WT and stop‐codon constructs, we can only estimate that premature termination typically reduces detectable protein levels by over 90% relative to full‐length.  
[TOO_HARD]  
Please provide quantitative expression data (e.g., normalized Western‐blot band intensities or targeted proteomics measurements) for both the HA–GADD45G construct and a full‐length control, or results from mRNA stability assays or in silico decay modeling to derive an exact fold‐change.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Derive the final conclusion on why the protein overexpression was not achieved as expected, based on the analysis of the sequence and its biological implications.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Analysis of the provided plus‐strand sequence shows that immediately after the HA tag coding region (…GCC AAA TGA…) there is an in‐frame TGA stop codon. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing overexpression of the full‐length HA–GADD45G protein.
