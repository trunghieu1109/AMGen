The codons TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC correctly encode YPYDVPDYA, so there are no mutations in the antigenic determinant.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent wXFE:\nNo mutations; the antigenic determinant sequence exactly matches the expected YPYDVPDYA epitope.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Analyze the sequence for the presence of any premature stop codons that could lead to early termination of translation. \n\n ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p0gX:\nI translated the provided plus‐strand sequence in the reading frame initiated by the HA epitope and identified a TGA codon immediately following the antigenic determinant. This TGA triplet is a stop codon (UGA) that would prematurely terminate translation before the GADD45G coding region.\n\n### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p0gX:\nThe sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to early termination of translation.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Determine if the lack of a linker sequence could be causing proteolysis of the nascent chain. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent rLfb:\nWhile lacking a flexible linker can in some contexts expose junctions to proteases, in this construct the dominant issue is a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag. Proteolysis due to no linker would present a full-length protein that is then cleaved; here translation never produces the downstream sequence, so the linker absence isn’t the cause.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent rLfb:\nNo, the lack of a linker sequence is unlikely to be causing proteolysis of the nascent chain.\n\n### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on tRNA presence. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent xS61:\nIn the standard eukaryotic genetic code, UAA is one of the three stop codons and is not recognized by any tRNA. Instead, release factors bind to UAA and terminate translation. Therefore, mouse cells do not have a tRNA for UAA.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent xS61:\nNo, mice lack a tRNA for the UAA codon; UAA functions as a stop codon recognized by release factors, causing translation termination.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Identify the most likely reason for the failure in overexpression based on the analysis of the sequence and the context of the experiment.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent 04W4, evaluating sequence, thinking: I examined the provided plus‐strand sequence and translated the first few codons. After the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) and a lysine, there’s a TGA codon, which is a stop signal. This would halt ribosomes prematurely, preventing expression of the downstream GADD45G coding sequence.; answer: The sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing early termination of translation.\nCoT-SC agent wXFE, comparing sequences, thinking: I translated the first 30 nucleotides and compared them to the canonical HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA). The codons TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC correctly encode YPYDVPDYA, so there are no mutations in the antigenic determinant.; answer: No mutations; the antigenic determinant sequence exactly matches the expected YPYDVPDYA epitope.\nCoT-SC agent mwUz, comparing sequences, thinking: I aligned the first codons of the construct (ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC) with the expected HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA). The translation yields M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A, matching the HA epitope exactly with an extra N‐terminal methionine and a lysine after the tag, so there are no mutations in the determinant sequence.; answer: The antigenic determinant exactly matches the expected HA tag sequence, with no mutations.\nCoT-SC agent k751, comparing sequences, thinking: The canonical HA epitope YPYDVPDYA is encoded by TAC-CCA-TAC-GAT-GTT-CCA-GAT-TAC-GCC. The provided sequence begins with ATG (Met) then TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC, exactly matching the HA tag. There are no base changes in those codons, so no missense mutations in the antigenic determinant.; answer: The antigenic determinant coding sequence exactly matches the expected HA epitope; no mutations or errors detected.\nReflexion CoT agent p0gX, analyzing stop codons, thinking: I translated the sequence in frame with the HA tag and identified that immediately following the epitope coding region there is a TGA codon, which is a stop signal. This premature stop would terminate translation before the GADD45G coding sequence is reached.; answer: The sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon leading to early termination of translation.\nCritic agent mZOU, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly pinpoints a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, but it doesn’t discuss how frame assignment was confirmed, ignore context effects on termination efficiency, or consider experimental validation of truncation.; answer: Limitations of the stop-codon analysis:\n1. Frame assignment: It assumes translation initiates at the first ATG and that no indels have shifted the reading frame. Any frame shift would abolish the apparent stop.\n2. Context effects: Stop-codon recognition efficiency depends on surrounding sequence (Kozak context, downstream nucleotides), which can influence termination or readthrough rates.\n3. In vivo suppression/readthrough: Certain contexts or tRNA suppressors can allow partial readthrough, reducing truncation.\n4. Alternative isoforms: Cryptic splice sites or downstream start codons may yield other translation products.\n5. Experimental confirmation: Western blot, mass spectrometry, or ribosome profiling are needed to verify actual termination at the predicted site.\nReflexion CoT agent p0gX, refining stop codon analysis, thinking: I translated the provided nucleotide sequence in the reading frame initiated by the HA epitope. Immediately following the epitope’s coding region, there is a TGA codon—one of the three stop codons. This premature stop signal would halt ribosomal translation before the GADD45G coding sequence, preventing full-length protein expression.; answer: The sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon leading to early termination of translation.\nCritic agent mZOU, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies a premature UGA stop codon, but it assumes the provided sequence is in the correct reading frame and doesn’t confirm frame alignment. It also overlooks potential alternative initiation sites, cryptic splice signals, or downstream context that could influence translation. Furthermore, it doesn’t validate the prediction with in silico translation of the full ORF or experimental confirmation of truncated products.; answer: Re-evaluate the sequence in all possible reading frames to confirm the in-frame stop codon; use an online translation tool to map all stop codons relative to the HA tag and GADD45G ORF; inspect for cryptic splice sites or frame shifts; and validate by Western blot or mass spectrometry to detect any truncated protein products.\nReflexion CoT agent p0gX, refining stop codon analysis, thinking: I translated the plus‐strand sequence in the reading frame initiated by the HA tag and identified a TGA codon immediately after the epitope coding region, which would act as a premature stop signal.; answer: The sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon leading to early termination of translation.\nCritic agent mZOU, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies a TGA triplet in the DNA sequence, but it assumes without verification that this codon lies in the biologically relevant open reading frame and immediately follows the intended start site.; answer: Limitations of the stop-codon analysis include: 1) It does not confirm that the HA tag start codon and Kozak sequence place translation in the same frame as the identified TGA. 2) It ignores any introns, untranslated regions, or leader sequences that might shift the reading frame. 3) It overlooks potential RNA processing events (splicing, editing) that could alter codon context. 4) It does not account for possible read-through or reinitiation mechanisms. 5) No experimental validation (mRNA or protein data) was used to confirm that this TGA actually terminates translation in vivo.\nReflexion CoT agent p0gX, refining stop codon analysis, thinking: I translated the provided plus‐strand sequence in the reading frame initiated by the HA epitope and identified a TGA codon immediately following the antigenic determinant. This TGA triplet is a stop codon (UGA) that would prematurely terminate translation before the GADD45G coding region.; answer: The sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to early termination of translation.\nCoT agent rLfb, evaluating linker sequence, thinking: While lacking a flexible linker can in some contexts expose junctions to proteases, in this construct the dominant issue is a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag.

Thus there is no tRNA for UAA, causing translation termination at that site.; answer: No; mice do not have a tRNA for the UAA stop codon—they use release factors to terminate translation.\nDebate agent pdYg, round 0, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: The UAA codon is one of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) recognized by release factors rather than by any tRNA. In eukaryotes (including mouse), no tRNA carries an anticodon for UAA — translation terminates when the ribosome encounters it.; answer: No, there is no tRNA for the UAA codon in mouse; UAA functions as a stop codon and triggers translation termination.\nDebate agent SxHx, round 0, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: In the standard genetic code UAA is one of the three stop codons and is not decoded by any tRNA. Instead, release factors recognize UAA and terminate translation. Thus no tRNA exists for UAA in mouse cells, leading to early termination at that codon.; answer: No, mice do not have a tRNA for the UAA codon; UAA is a stop codon recognized by release factors.\nDebate agent m0ex, round 0, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: In all organisms, UAA is one of the three stop codons and is not decoded by any tRNA; instead, release factors recognize it to terminate translation. Therefore, no tRNA for UAA exists in the mouse, and the presence of UAA in the mRNA will cause translation termination.; answer: No, the UAA codon is a stop signal and there is no corresponding tRNA in mouse; release factors recognize UAA and terminate translation.\nDebate agent eO9g, round 1, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: In all eukaryotes, including mice, UAA is one of the three stop codons and is not decoded by a tRNA. Instead, release factors recognize UAA to terminate translation.

Therefore no tRNA exists for UAA in mouse cells.; answer: No, there is no tRNA for the UAA codon in mouse; UAA acts as a stop signal recognized by release factors.\nDebate agent eO9g, round 2, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: In eukaryotes such as mice the UAA triplet corresponds to a stop codon rather than an amino acid; no cognate tRNA exists for UAA. Instead, release factors bind to UAA and terminate translation, so encountering UAA in the mRNA will lead to premature chain release.; answer: No, mice do not have a tRNA for the UAA codon; UAA functions as a stop codon recognized by release factors, causing translation termination.\nDebate agent pdYg, round 2, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: In eukaryotes, including mouse, UAA is a stop codon recognized by release factors; no tRNA decodes UAA, so translation terminates at UAA.; answer: [ERROR]\nDebate agent SxHx, round 2, verifying tRNA presence, thinking: In the standard eukaryotic genetic code, UAA is one of the three stop codons and is not recognized by any tRNA.
