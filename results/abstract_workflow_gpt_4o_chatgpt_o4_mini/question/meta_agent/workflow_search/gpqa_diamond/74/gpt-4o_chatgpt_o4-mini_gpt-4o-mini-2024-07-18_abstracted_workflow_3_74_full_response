I can outline the typical approach and expected magnitude but cannot calculate a precise value without actual measurements. Therefore, I must flag this as too difficult given missing data and request the needed information.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ty0j:\nWithout specific densitometry or mass‐spectrometry data comparing WT and stop‐codon constructs, we can only estimate that premature termination typically reduces detectable protein levels by over 90% relative to full‐length.  \n[TOO_HARD]  \nPlease provide quantitative expression data (e.g., normalized Western‐blot band intensities or targeted proteomics measurements) for both the HA–GADD45G construct and a full‐length control, or results from mRNA stability assays or in silico decay modeling to derive an exact fold‐change.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Derive the final conclusion on why the protein overexpression was not achieved as expected, based on the analysis of the sequence and its biological implications.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent ck7N, thinking: We need the full GADD45G coding sequence to outline the complete expected construct; this is not provided. Suggest retrieving it from a database to complete the fusion sequence.; answer: Expected construct begins with the influenza HA tag coding sequence (encoding YPYDVPDYA; nucleotide sequence: ATGTATCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT), fused in-frame to the mouse GADD45G coding sequence from its ATG start to stop codon. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the full mouse GADD45G coding sequence or its accession number to complete the expected sequence.\nCoT-SC agent fjNW, thinking: I compared the first 30 bases of the actual construct to the expected HA‐tag fusion. The HA tag coding (YPYDVPDYA) is intact, but right after the tag–and one Lys codon (AAA)–the next triplet is TGA, a stop codon. This premature stop would truncate the fusion protein immediately after the tag, explaining the lack of overexpression.; answer: The insert contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately following the tag (after the AAA Lys codon), causing early termination of translation.\nCoT-SC agent BXQm, thinking: The provided sequence matches the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) exactly when including the extra Met start—no missense mutation there. However, without the full mouse GADD45G coding sequence or its accession number, we cannot compare downstream regions for discrepancies.; answer: No discrepancies identified in the HA tag sequence. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the full mouse GADD45G coding sequence or its accession number to complete the comparison.\nCoT-SC agent lmqp, thinking: We expect the HA tag coding sequence (YPYDVPDYA) to be followed in-frame by the GADD45G start codon without any stop codons. Parsing the provided sequence shows ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA… The TGA at positions 34–36 is an in‐frame stop, which is not in the expected sequence and will cause premature translation termination.; answer: The provided sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing early termination of translation.\nReflexion CoT agent FcFV, thinking: The provided sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing translation to terminate early.; answer: early termination\nCritic agent JUrJ, thinking: Your classification is correct: the construct contains an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to early termination of translation.; answer: early termination\nReflexion CoT agent FcFV, refining classification, thinking: The sequence has an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing translation to terminate early.; answer: B)\nCritic agent JUrJ, thinking: Correct classification. The sequence contains an in-frame stop codon (TGA) right after the HA tag, causing translation to terminate early.; answer: The ribosome terminated the translation early\nReflexion CoT agent FcFV, refining classification, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately following the HA tag, causing early termination of translation.; answer: B)\nCritic agent JUrJ, thinking: Correct classification. The sequence contains an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing early termination of translation.; answer: choice2\nReflexion CoT agent FcFV, refining classification, thinking: The provided sequence contains an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately following the HA tag, causing translation to terminate early.; answer: B)\nDebate agent iF8T, round 0, thinking: The premature UGA stop codon immediately following the HA tag causes the ribosome to terminate translation before the GADD45G coding region is synthesized. As a result, only a very short N-terminal peptide (containing the HA epitope) is produced. This truncated polypeptide lacks the remainder of the protein’s sequence, cannot fold properly, and is rapidly targeted for proteasomal degradation, explaining the lack of detectable overexpression and failure to pull down full-length protein partners.; answer: The early termination codon aborts translation, yielding only a short HA‐tagged peptide that lacks the rest of GADD45G, which misfolds and is rapidly degraded by proteolysis, preventing expression of functional protein.\nDebate agent 58dZ, round 0, thinking: The in-frame stop codon immediately after the HA tag forces premature translation termination, yielding only the short HA‐tag peptide. This truncation prevents synthesis of the intended fusion protein, leaving no linker or GADD45G sequence. The aberrant mRNA may also be targeted for nonsense‐mediated decay. Any truncated peptide made would likely be unstable, rapidly degraded by cellular proteases or the ubiquitin–proteasome system, abolishing both expression of the full‐length fusion protein and its functional interactions.; answer: Premature stop codon causes early termination of translation, leading to a truncated HA tag peptide and no full‐length fusion protein, while also promoting mRNA decay and rapid proteolytic degradation of the incomplete product.\nDebate agent DnBk, round 0, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, so translation terminates prematurely. The result is a truncated polypeptide lacking GADD45G domains. Such truncated peptides are typically unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and the upstream stop can also trigger nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay, preventing accumulation of the mRNA. Consequently, no functional full‐length protein is produced, abolishing expected protein–protein interactions and biological activity.; answer: The premature TGA stop codon leads to early translation termination, yielding only a short HA‐tagged fragment that lacks GADD45G’s functional domains; this truncated product is unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome (and the mRNA may undergo nonsense‐mediated decay), so no full‐length, functional protein accumulates.\nDebate agent LGkX, round 0, thinking: The premature in‐frame stop codon immediately after the HA tag causes translation to terminate early, yielding a short peptide that lacks the intended GADD45G sequence and any downstream linker. This aberrant nascent chain is unstable, misfolded, and rapidly targeted for degradation by cellular proteolysis pathways (e.g., the proteasome), preventing accumulation of the full‐length fusion protein and abolishing its function.; answer: The early stop codon truncates the protein right after the HA tag, so the full‐length fusion never forms. The tiny peptide is misfolded and rapidly degraded by proteolytic systems, eliminating expression and function of GADD45G in the model.\nDebate agent iF8T, round 1, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame UGA stop codon right after the HA tag, so translation terminates prematurely. This truncation yields only a tiny HA‐tagged peptide that lacks the GADD45G coding region. Such incomplete products are typically recognized as misfolded or aberrant and rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and the mRNA may also be subject to nonsense‐mediated decay. Consequently, no stable, full‐length fusion protein accumulates and GADD45G function is lost.; answer: The premature stop codon causes early translation termination, producing only a short HA‐tag peptide that is misfolded and rapidly degraded by proteolysis (and its mRNA may be degraded via nonsense‐mediated decay), preventing expression and function of the full‐length GADD45G fusion protein.\nDebate agent 58dZ, round 1, thinking: The in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag causes ribosomes to terminate translation prematurely. This yields only a short HA‐tagged peptide and prevents synthesis of the GADD45G fusion. The truncated mRNA may be degraded by nonsense‐mediated decay, and any nascent peptide is unstable and rapidly targeted for proteasomal degradation, so no full‐length, functional protein accumulates.; answer: The premature stop codon aborts translation after the HA tag, yielding only a short peptide that lacks GADD45G. The aberrant mRNA may undergo nonsense‐mediated decay, and the truncated product is unstable and rapidly degraded by proteolysis, abolishing expression and function of the full‐length fusion protein.\nDebate agent DnBk, round 1, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag. This will cause ribosomes to terminate translation prematurely, producing only a short N‐terminal peptide. Such truncated peptides lack proper folding, are recognized as aberrant, and are rapidly degraded by cellular proteolysis systems (e.g., the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway). Additionally, the presence of a premature termination codon can trigger nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay, reducing mRNA levels and further preventing any full‐length protein expression.; answer: The in-frame stop codon aborts translation right after the HA tag, yielding only a tiny peptide. This truncated product cannot fold or function, is rapidly targeted by proteolytic pathways (e.g., ubiquitin–proteasome system), and the mRNA may be degraded via nonsense-mediated decay, preventing any full-length GADD45G fusion protein accumulation.\nDebate agent LGkX, round 1, thinking: The in‐frame TGA stop codon right after the HA tag forces ribosomal termination before the GADD45G coding region is translated. As a result, only a short HA‐tagged peptide is produced, which cannot fold properly and is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (and the mRNA may also be targeted for nonsense‐mediated decay), so no full‐length fusion protein accumulates.; answer: The premature stop codon aborts translation immediately after the HA tag, leading to a truncated peptide that misfolds and is rapidly degraded (and the mRNA may undergo nonsense‐mediated decay), preventing any full‐length GADD45G fusion protein expression.\nDebate agent iF8T, round 2, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame UGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing ribosomes to terminate translation prematurely. This yields only a short N‐terminal HA‐tagged peptide lacking the GADD45G coding region. Such truncated peptides misfold and are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and the presence of a premature termination codon often triggers nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay, reducing transcript levels and preventing any full‐length fusion protein accumulation.; answer: The premature stop codon causes translation to terminate immediately after the HA tag, producing only a short peptide that is misfolded and rapidly degraded by proteasomal pathways (and its mRNA may undergo nonsense‐mediated decay), thus preventing expression and function of the full‐length GADD45G fusion protein.\nDebate agent 58dZ, round 2, thinking: The identified in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag leads to premature termination of translation. Consequently, only a short HA-tagged peptide is synthesized, and the downstream GADD45G coding sequence is never translated. This truncated peptide is nonfunctional and likely misfolded, triggering rapid degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. In addition, the presence of a premature termination codon can activate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, reducing mRNA stability and further diminishing any chance of full-length protein production.; answer: The premature stop codon causes early translation termination, producing only a short HA-tag peptide that is misfolded and rapidly degraded by proteolysis (and its mRNA may be degraded via nonsense-mediated decay), thereby preventing expression and function of the full-length GADD45G fusion protein.\nDebate agent DnBk, round 2, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame UGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing translation to terminate prematurely. This yields only a short N‐terminal peptide that cannot fold properly, triggers nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay, and is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system, so no full‐length GADD45G fusion protein accumulates.; answer: The premature stop codon aborts translation after the HA tag, producing only a short peptide that misfolds and is rapidly degraded (and its mRNA is likely degraded via nonsense‐mediated decay), preventing any full‐length GADD45G fusion protein expression.\nDebate agent LGkX, round 2, thinking: The sequence contains an in‐frame TGA (UGA) stop codon immediately after the HA tag. This premature termination prevents translation of the GADD45G coding region, yielding only a short N-terminal peptide. Such truncated peptides cannot fold properly and are rapidly targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Additionally, the presence of a premature stop codon can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, reducing mRNA levels and further preventing any full-length fusion protein expression.; answer: The premature stop codon aborts translation immediately after the HA tag, producing only a short peptide that is misfolded and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and the mRNA is likely degraded via nonsense-mediated decay, preventing accumulation of any full-length GADD45G fusion protein.\nFinal Decision agent, thinking: The construct sequence contains an in-frame UGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag. This causes premature termination of translation, producing only a short N-terminal peptide. Such truncated peptides misfold and are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and the premature stop codon also triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, reducing mRNA stability and preventing any full-length fusion protein accumulation.; answer: The in-frame UGA stop codon immediately downstream of the HA tag causes premature translation termination, yielding a truncated peptide that is misfolded and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and the premature stop also triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, abolishing full-length HA–GADD45G fusion protein expression and function.\nCoT agent Ty0j, thinking: The question asks for a quantitative measure but no experimental or simulation data have been provided.
