    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene&#39;s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5&#39;ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3&#39;\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.&#34;, choice1=&#39;The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain&#39;, choice2=&#39;The ribosome terminated the translation early&#39;, choice3=&#39;The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation&#39;, choice4=&#39;The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Compare the sequence of the antigenic determinant with the expected sequence to check for any mutations or errors. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent wXFE:
I translated the first 30 nucleotides and compared them to the canonical HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA). The codons TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC correctly encode YPYDVPDYA, so there are no mutations in the antigenic determinant.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent wXFE:
No mutations; the antigenic determinant sequence exactly matches the expected YPYDVPDYA epitope.

### Sub-task 3: Analyze the sequence for the presence of any premature stop codons that could lead to early termination of translation. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p0gX:
I translated the provided plus‐strand sequence in the reading frame initiated by the HA epitope and identified a TGA codon immediately following the antigenic determinant. This TGA triplet is a stop codon (UGA) that would prematurely terminate translation before the GADD45G coding region.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p0gX:
The sequence contains a premature TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, leading to early termination of translation.

### Sub-task 4: Determine if the lack of a linker sequence could be causing proteolysis of the nascent chain. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent rLfb:
While lacking a flexible linker can in some contexts expose junctions to proteases, in this construct the dominant issue is a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag. Proteolysis due to no linker would present a full-length protein that is then cleaved; here translation never produces the downstream sequence, so the linker absence isn’t the cause.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent rLfb:
No, the lack of a linker sequence is unlikely to be causing proteolysis of the nascent chain.

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on tRNA presence. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent xS61:
In the standard eukaryotic genetic code, UAA is one of the three stop codons and is not recognized by any tRNA. Instead, release factors bind to UAA and terminate translation. Therefore, mouse cells do not have a tRNA for UAA.

### answer by Final Decision Agent xS61:
No, mice lack a tRNA for the UAA codon; UAA functions as a stop codon recognized by release factors, causing translation termination.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Identify the most likely reason for the failure in overexpression based on the analysis of the sequence and the context of the experiment.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
