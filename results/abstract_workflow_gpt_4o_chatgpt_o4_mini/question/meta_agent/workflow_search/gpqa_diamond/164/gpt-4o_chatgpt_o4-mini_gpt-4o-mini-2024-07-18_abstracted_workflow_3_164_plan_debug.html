    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?&#39;, choice1=&#39;Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.&#39;, choice2=&#39;Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.&#39;, choice3=&#39;One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.&#39;, choice4=&#39;Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Classify each statement based on the findings from subtasks 1 to 4 to determine which statement is correct. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent p6HV:
Based on subtask analyses, only the statement that aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential chain-walking branching step is correct.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent w4xX:
Subtask analyses show that dual homogeneous systems aren’t industrially implemented (A false), Group VIa catalysts require non-Al activators (B true), Group VIa with specific activators as stated in C is incorrect for branching, and noble metals though capable are too costly (D true but secondary). The uniquely correct statement is B.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent b5wZ:
Based on the subtasks, industrial dual systems aren’t implemented (A false), group VIa catalysts need non-Al activators (B true), group VIa systems aren’t branched with Al activators (C false), and noble metals are too costly (D true but not primary). Thus only statement 2 is correct.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent yEna:
Based on subtasks: industrial dual homogeneous systems aren’t implemented (1 false); group VIa catalysts require non-Al activators for branching (3 true but implies non-Al); noble metals are cost-prohibitive (4 true but not recommended); the statement uniquely correct and essential is that Al-based activators fail for the branching step.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent p6HV:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent w4xX:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent b5wZ:
B)

### answer #3 by Debate Agent yEna:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct statement.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
