    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;3&#39;, choice3=&#39;1&#39;, choice4=&#39;2&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Identify the possible final organic products that can be formed from the intermediates. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vLO9:
The benzyne intermediate can be formed by deprotonation at either ortho position, leading to an unlabeled aniline and two monodeuterated anilines if the ortho sites are treated as distinct. However, deuterium exchange with NH₃ and symmetry may reduce or scramble these products, and no information on exchange rates or product resolution is given, making definitive isolation difficult.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vLO9:
1) Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)
2) 2-Deuterioaniline (D at C2)
3) 6-Deuterioaniline (D at C6)
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify whether deuterium exchange with NH₃ is allowed and whether the two ortho positions are to be treated as distinct for isolation purposes.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Count the number of distinct organic products formed in the reaction.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The benzyne intermediate can form monodeuterated aniline at two ortho positions, but after substitution the ring symmetry renders these identical. Without evidence of H/D exchange or position resolution, two distinct products exist: aniline and monodeuterioaniline.

Answer:2
