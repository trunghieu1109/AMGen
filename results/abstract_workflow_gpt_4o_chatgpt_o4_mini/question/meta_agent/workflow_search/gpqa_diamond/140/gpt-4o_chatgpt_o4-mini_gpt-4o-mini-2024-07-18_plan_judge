Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_140
proposed answer: The benzyne intermediate can be attacked at two positions and allows H/D exchange, giving 2-deuteroaniline, 1-deuteroaniline, and non-deuterated aniline – three distinct products.

Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_140
proposed answer: The benzyne intermediate can form monodeuterated aniline at two ortho positions, but after substitution the ring symmetry renders these identical. Without evidence of H/D exchange or position resolution, two distinct products exist: aniline and monodeuterioaniline.

Answer:2
[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify whether deuterium exchange with NH₃ is allowed and whether the two ortho positions are to be treated as distinct for isolation purposes.
