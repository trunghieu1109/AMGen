    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;3&#39;, choice3=&#39;1&#39;, choice4=&#39;2&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Analyze the stability and reactivity of the identified intermediates to predict the possible organic products. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vlS0:
The benzyne intermediate undergoes attack by NH2– at either triple‐bond carbon, yielding 1-deuteroaniline or 2-deuteroaniline. Under strongly basic, deuterated conditions, reversible proton/deuteron exchange can also replace D with H, giving non-deuterated aniline. Thus three distinct products are expected, though further H/D scrambling could give minor isotopologues.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vlS0:
Possible products: (1) 2-deuteroaniline (D at C2), (2) 1-deuteroaniline (D at C1), and (3) non-deuterated aniline

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Count the distinct organic products that can be formed from the reaction, considering all possible pathways and intermediates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
