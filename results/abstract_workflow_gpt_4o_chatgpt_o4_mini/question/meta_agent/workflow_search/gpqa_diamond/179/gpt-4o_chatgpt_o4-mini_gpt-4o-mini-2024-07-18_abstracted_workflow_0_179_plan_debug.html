Example(question=&#39;Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?&#39;, choice1=&#39;2.822 x 10^-26&#39;, choice2=&#39;5.645 x 10^-26&#39;, choice3=&#39;7.056 x 10^-27&#39;, choice4=&#39;122.330&#39;, correct_index=0).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct energy choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
