Example(question=&#39;Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?&#39;, choice1=&#39;2.822 x 10^-26&#39;, choice2=&#39;5.645 x 10^-26&#39;, choice3=&#39;7.056 x 10^-27&#39;, choice4=&#39;122.330&#39;, correct_index=0).
