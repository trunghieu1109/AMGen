    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 4.4&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 33.4&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 10.4&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 3.2&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 5: Select the correct choice from the given options that matches the calculated ratio of the orbital periods between Planet1 and Planet3. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Sm69:
Using Kepler’s third law P ∝ a^(3/2) with a₃/a₁ ≈ 10.3 gives P₃/P₁ ≈ 10.3^(3/2) ≈ 33.1, matching option ~33.4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent MZ9s:
Using Kepler’s third law with a₃/a₁ ≈ 10.3 yields P₃/P₁ ≈ (10.3)^(3/2) ≈ 33.1, matching the option ~33.4.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent lu7s:
Using Kepler’s third law P ∝ a^(3/2) with a₃/a₁ ≈ 10.3 gives P₃/P₁ ≈ (10.3)^(1.5) ≈ 33.1, matching option B).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent B0lC:
Using Kepler’s third law P ∝ a^(3/2) with the semi-major axis ratio a₃/a₁ ≈ 10.3 gives P₃/P₁ ≈ (10.3)^(3/2) ≈ 33.1, which matches option B).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
