From Kepler’s third law for circular orbits, a ∝ P^(2/3). Substituting gives T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).; answer: T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\nCoT-SC agent Eu3m, calculating period ratio, thinking: From subtask 1, T_eq ∝ P^(−1/3) ⇒ P ∝ T_eq^(−3). Given T1/T2 = 1.4, the period ratio P2/P1 = (T1/T2)^3 = 1.4^3 ≈ 2.74.; answer: ≈2.74\nCoT-SC agent nLBr, calculating period ratio, thinking: From subtask 1: T_eq ∝ P^(–1/3) ⇒ P ∝ T_eq^(–3). Therefore the ratio P1/P2 = (T1/T2)^(–3) = (1.4)^(–3) ≈ 1/(1.4^3) ≈ 0.36.; answer: ≈ 0.36\nCoT-SC agent i0f4, calculating period ratio, thinking: From subtask 1 we have T_eq ∝ P^(−1/3). Thus T1/T2 = (P1/P2)^(−1/3) = 1.4. Rearranging gives P1/P2 = (1.4)^(−3) ≈ 0.36.; answer: P1/P2 ≈ 0.36\nCoT-SC agent dlEO, calculating period ratio, thinking: The equilibrium temperature scales as T_eq ∝ P^(−1/3). Therefore T2/T3 = (P3/P2)^(1/3) = 2.3, so P3/P2 = 2.3^3 ≈ 12.17.; answer: ≈ 12.2\nCoT-SC agent GJ9f, calculating period ratio, thinking: From subtask 1: T_eq ∝ P^(−1/3) ⇒ P ∝ T_eq^(−3).

Given T_eq2/T_eq3 ≃ 2.3, the period ratio P3/P2 = (T_eq2/T_eq3)^3 ≃ 2.3^3 ≃ 12.17.; answer: ≈ 12.2\nCoT agent lXr0, determining relationship, thinking: The orbital period for a planet in a circular orbit is given by Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law: P^2 = 4π^2 a^3/[G(M_star + M_planet)]. Thus the period depends on the total mass (star plus planet) to the –1/2 power. Since planet masses are usually ≪ stellar mass, P is nearly independent of the planet mass, scaling as (M_star + M_planet)^–1/2.; answer: P ∝ (M_star + M_planet)^(–1/2), so the orbital period is inversely proportional to the square root of the total mass (star plus planet).\nCoT-SC agent 60HQ, calculating period ratio, thinking: From Kepler’s third law P ∝ (M_star+M_planet)^–1/2.
