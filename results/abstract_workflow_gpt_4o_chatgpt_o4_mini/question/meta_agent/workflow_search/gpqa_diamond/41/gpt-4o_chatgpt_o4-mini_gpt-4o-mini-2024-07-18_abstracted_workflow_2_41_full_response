Given T1/T2 ≈ 1.4, the ratio a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2 ≈ (1.4)^2 ≈ 1.96.; answer: ~1.96\nCoT agent WzuA, calculating semi-major axis ratio for Planet2 and Planet3, thinking: For planets with the same albedo, Teq∝a⁻¹ᐟ² (stellar luminosity is same). Thus a∝Teq⁻². Given T2/T3≈2.3, then a2/a3=(T3/T2)²=(1/2.3)²≈0.19.; answer: ≈0.19\nReflexion CoT agent 51mL, calculating semi-major axis ratio for Planet1 and Planet3, thinking: We have a2/a1 ≈ 1.96 from subtask 1 and a2/a3 ≈ 0.19 from subtask 2. Thus a3/a1 = (a2/a1)/(a2/a3) ≈ 1.96/0.19 ≈ 10.3.; answer: ~10.3\nCritic agent GdoJ, providing feedback, thinking: The combination is done correctly. From Teq1/Teq2=1.4 you get a2/a1=(1.4)^2≈1.96, and from Teq2/Teq3=2.3 you get a3/a2=(2.3)^2≈5.29. Multiplying gives a3/a1≈1.96·5.29≈10.37, so ≈10.3 (≈10.4 in the given choices).; answer: ~10.3\nReflexion CoT agent 51mL, refining semi-major axis ratio for Planet1 and Planet3, thinking: We have a2/a1 ≈ 1.96 from subtask 1 and a2/a3 ≈ 0.19 from subtask 2. Therefore, a3/a1 = (a2/a1)/(a2/a3) = 1.96/0.19 ≈ 10.3.; answer: ~10.3\nCritic agent GdoJ, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation is correct. Given a2/a1≈1.96 and a2/a3≈0.19, the ratio a3/a1 = (a2/a1)/(a2/a3) = 1.96 ÷ 0.19 ≈ 10.3.; answer: ~10.3\nReflexion CoT agent 51mL, refining semi-major axis ratio for Planet1 and Planet3, thinking: We have from subtask 1 that a2/a1 ≈ 1.96, and from subtask 2 that a2/a3 ≈ 0.19. The ratio a3/a1 = (a2/a1) / (a2/a3) ≈ 1.96 ÷ 0.19 ≈ 10.3.; answer: ~10.3\nCritic agent GdoJ, providing feedback, thinking: The approach is sound: since a2/a1 ≃ 1.96 and a2/a3 ≃ 0.19, dividing (a2/a1) by (a2/a3) correctly yields a3/a1 ≃ 1.96/0.19 ≃ 10.3.; answer: ~10.3\nReflexion CoT agent 51mL, refining semi-major axis ratio for Planet1 and Planet3, thinking: From subtask1 we have a2/a1≈(1.4)^2≈1.96, and from subtask2 a2/a3≈(T2/T3)^2≈(1/2.3)^2≈0.19.
