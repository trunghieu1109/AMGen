Example(question=&#39;In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.&#39;, choice1=&#39;2.08*1e-1 m&#39;, choice2=&#39;2.08*1e-9 m&#39;, choice3=&#39;2.08*1e-6 m&#39;, choice4=&#39;2.08*1e-3 m&#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated minimum resolution with the given choices to identify the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent HRvP:
The required minimum resolution L_res ≈ 6.8×10⁻⁷ m is closest to 2.08×10⁻⁶ m among the given options.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent LAxD:
Calculated minimum resolution L_res ≈ –L ln(0.7) ≈ 6.8×10⁻⁷ m; among the options, 2.08×10⁻⁶ m is the closest match.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 6ZaX:
The required minimum resolution L_res ≈ –L ln(0.7) ≈ 6.8×10⁻⁷ m; among the given options the closest is 2.08×10⁻⁶ m, corresponding to choice C).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the correct resolution.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
