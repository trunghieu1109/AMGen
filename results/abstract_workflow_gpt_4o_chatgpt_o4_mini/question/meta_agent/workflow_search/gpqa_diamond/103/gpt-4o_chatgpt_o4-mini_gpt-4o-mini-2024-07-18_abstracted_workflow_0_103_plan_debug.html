    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 0.36&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 1.40&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 1.96&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 0.85&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 5: Apply the relationship between star velocity and orbital period to find the ratio of the orbital periods of planet #2 to planet #1. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent tJHo:
The RV semi‐amplitude K∝P^(−1/3), so P∝K^(−3). With K1/K2=Δλ1/Δλ2=5/7, P₂/P₁=(5/7)³≈0.36, matching choice A).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent SCDE:
For circular orbits with equal stellar and planetary masses, the RV semiamplitude K ∝ P^(−1/3), so P ∝ K^(−3). With v1/v2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 5/7, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 9Ypv:
Using Δλ ratio gives v1/v2 = 5/7 and since the RV semi-amplitude K ∝ P^(−1/3), we have P ∝ K^(−3), so P2/P1 = (v1/v2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent nuym:
For circular orbits with equal stellar and planetary masses, the RV semi-amplitude K scales as P^(–1/3). Since K ∝ Δλ, we have P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the ratio of orbital periods.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The RV semi‐amplitude K scales as P^(−1/3) and is proportional to the observed wavelength shift Δλ. Thus P ∝ (Δλ)^(−3). With Δλ1/Δλ2 = 5/7, P₂/P₁ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.
