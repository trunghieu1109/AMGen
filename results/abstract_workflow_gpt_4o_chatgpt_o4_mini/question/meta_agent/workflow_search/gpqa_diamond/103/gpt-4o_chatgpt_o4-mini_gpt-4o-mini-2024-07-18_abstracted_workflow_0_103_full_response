This yields a dependence K∝P^{-1/3}. However, to get a full numeric expression we need the planet’s actual mass (or M_p sin i) and the inclination.; answer: K = (2πG/P)^{1/3} · (M_p\u2009sin\u2009i)/(M_*+M_p)^{2/3}, so K ∝ P^{-1/3}\n[TOO_HARD]\nProvide the planet’s M_p\u2009sin\u2009i (and inclination) to compute the constant of proportionality.\nCritic agent GxlE, providing feedback, thinking: The characterization K ∝ P^(-1/3) is mathematically correct under idealized assumptions but lacks practical details. It assumes a circular, edge-on orbit (sin i=1), neglects the planet’s actual mass (M_p vs M_*), and ignores orbital eccentricity, inclination degeneracy, stellar jitter, and observational noise.; answer: A complete RV semi-amplitude formula is K = (2πG/P)^{1/3}·(M_p sin i)/(M_*+M_p)^{2/3}. Limitations: needs M_p sin i and orbital inclination, assumes M_p≪M_*, circular and single-planet orbit, and does not account for eccentricity, stellar activity, or instrumental systematics.\nReflexion CoT agent mzxh, refining characterization, thinking: We can derive the stellar radial‐velocity amplitude K from the orbital period P using Kepler’s third law combined with the RV amplitude formula.

However, it omits key assumptions and limitations: it assumes a circular orbit, M_p ≪ M_*, and sin i ≈ 1. It also neglects orbital inclination, the sin i degeneracy, and any orbital eccentricity, all of which affect the true RV amplitude and the constant of proportionality.; answer: K = (2πG/P)^{1/3}·(M_p sin i)/(M_*+M_p)^{2/3} ⇒ for M_p≪M_*: K ∝ (M_p sin i)/M_*^{2/3}·P^{-1/3}\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the planet’s M_p sin i, orbital inclination, and eccentricity (or suggest typical values) to compute the constant of proportionality and refine this relation.\nReflexion CoT agent mzxh, refining characterization, thinking: To relate the stellar radial‐velocity amplitude K to the orbital period P, we combine Kepler’s third law with the RV amplitude formula.

It also neglects orbital eccentricity, stellar activity (jitter), and measurement uncertainties.; answer: The amplitude of the stellar radial‐velocity signal is given by K = (2πG/P)^{1/3}·(M_p sin\u2009i)/(M_*+M_p)^{2/3}, which for Mp ≪ M* simplifies to K ∝ P^{–1/3}.  Limitations: one must know M_p sin\u2009i and orbital inclination to compute the constant, assume a circular orbit (e=0), treat Mp ≪ M*, and neglect stellar jitter and measurement errors.\nReflexion CoT agent mzxh, refining characterization, thinking: To relate the stellar radial‐velocity amplitude K to the orbital period P, combine Kepler’s third law with the RV amplitude formula.
