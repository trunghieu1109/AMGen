Question: Example(question='Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', choice1='~ 0.36', choice2='~ 1.40', choice3='~ 1.96', choice4='~ 0.85', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_103
proposed answer: The RV semi‐amplitude K scales as P^(−1/3) and is proportional to the observed wavelength shift Δλ. Thus P ∝ (Δλ)^(−3). With Δλ1/Δλ2 = 5/7, P₂/P₁ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_103
proposed answer: Using the relation K ∝ Δλ and K ∝ P^(−1/3), we get P ∝ (Δλ)^(−3). Thus P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36, corresponding to choice A).
