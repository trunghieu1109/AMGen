Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_83
proposed answer: Comparing the roles: nonlocal boundary conditions pertain to problem setup, stability analysis ensures correctness but not parallelism, complex roots affect approximation accuracy but not parallel decomposition. Only linear partial‚Äêfraction decomposition decouples terms for concurrent computation, confirming it as the key factor.
