    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is&#39;, choice1=&#39;Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions&#39;, choice2=&#39;Stability analysis&#39;, choice3=&#39;Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation&#39;, choice4=&#39;Complex roots of fractional approximation&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Apply the understanding of linear partial fraction of fractional approximation to determine its role in parallel algorithm conversion. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HfvX:
Linear partial-fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation expresses the matrix exponential as a sum of independent rational terms. Each term involves a shifted linear system that can be solved separately. This decouples the computation and allows each fractional term to be evaluated concurrently on different processors, enabling the conversion of the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent HfvX:
By decomposing the matrix exponential into independent rational terms, each term can be computed concurrently, thereby enabling parallelization of the overall algorithm.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Confirm the selected choice by comparing it with the understanding of the other choices and their roles in the context.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Comparing the roles: nonlocal boundary conditions pertain to problem setup, stability analysis ensures correctness but not parallelism, complex roots affect approximation accuracy but not parallel decomposition.
