    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is&#39;, choice1=&#39;Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions&#39;, choice2=&#39;Stability analysis&#39;, choice3=&#39;Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation&#39;, choice4=&#39;Complex roots of fractional approximation&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Select the choice that best qualifies as the key factor in converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, based on the analysis of their impact and relevance. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent cosG:
Based on the analysis, only the linear partial-fraction decomposition inherently splits the matrix exponential into independent shifted-resolvent solves that can be computed concurrently, enabling parallelization.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Czhz:
Only the linear partial‐fraction decomposition inherently splits the matrix exponential into independent shifted‐resolvent tasks that can be computed concurrently, directly enabling parallelization of the algorithm.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent sZWa:
Only the linear partial-fraction decomposition inherently splits the matrix exponential into independent tasks enabling parallelization.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent XWzH:
The linear partial‐fraction decomposition splits the matrix exponential into independent shifted‐resolvent terms that can be computed concurrently, directly enabling parallelization.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on key factor selection.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
