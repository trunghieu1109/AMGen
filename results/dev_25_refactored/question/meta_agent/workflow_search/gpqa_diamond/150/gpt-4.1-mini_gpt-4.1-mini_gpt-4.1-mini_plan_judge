Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the observable P, we first normalize the given state vector. The original state vector is (-1, 2, 1), whose norm is sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). The normalized state vector is therefore (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)). Next, we identify the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of the operator P. Solving P*v = 0*v yields the eigenvector (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), which is normalized. The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto this eigenvector. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = -1/sqrt(12) - 1/sqrt(12) = -2/sqrt(12) = -1/sqrt(3). Squaring this magnitude gives (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. This calculation assumes the state vector and eigenvector are normalized, the observable is Hermitian (ensuring real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors), and the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, making the projection unique. All debate agents agree on this result, confirming its correctness. Therefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable yields 0 is 1/3, corresponding to choice A).
