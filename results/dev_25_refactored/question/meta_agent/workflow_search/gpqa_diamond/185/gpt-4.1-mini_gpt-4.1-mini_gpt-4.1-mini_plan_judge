Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_185
proposed answer: The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic pericyclic reaction that involves a concerted shift of sigma bonds in a 1,5-diene system. The starting compound, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, contains a bicyclic azabicycloheptene framework with a vinyl substituent at position 2 and a double bond at position 5, which together form the 1,5-diene system necessary for the rearrangement. The nitrogen atom at the bridgehead and the stereochemistry (1S,4R) impose constraints on the regiochemistry and stereochemical outcome of the rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement proceeds suprafacially, preserving stereochemistry and orbital symmetry, and results in a rearranged fused ring system. This rearrangement shifts the double bonds and ring junctions, leading to tetrahydro-cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivatives with specific hydrogenation patterns and ring fusion positions. Among the four given options, the product 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine (choice A) best matches the expected outcome of the Cope rearrangement for this substrate. This is because the rearrangement leads to saturation at positions 4,4a,7,7a, consistent with the suprafacial [3,3]-sigmatropic shift and the stereochemical constraints of the starting material. The other options represent isomers with different saturation patterns or ring fusion sites that are less consistent with the mechanistic pathway and stereochemical considerations. Therefore, considering the structural and stereochemical changes, the most plausible product is choice A.
