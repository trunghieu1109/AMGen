Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars per unit parallax interval varies as N(plx) ~ 1/(plx^5). Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance r, i.e., plx = 1/r. Substituting plx = 1/r into the expression gives N(plx) ~ r^5. However, this is the number of stars per unit parallax interval, not per unit distance interval. To find the number of stars per unit distance interval, we must apply the change of variables formula, which involves the Jacobian of the transformation from parallax to distance. The derivative of parallax with respect to distance is d(plx)/d(r) = -1/r^2, and its absolute value is 1/r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval is N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/d(r)| = r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This means the number of stars per unit distance interval varies as r^3. This result is consistent with the physical intuition that the volume element in three-dimensional space scales as r^2 (surface area) times dr, and the given distribution is weighted towards larger distances, resulting in the r^3 dependence. Hence, the correct choice is the one proportional to r^3.
