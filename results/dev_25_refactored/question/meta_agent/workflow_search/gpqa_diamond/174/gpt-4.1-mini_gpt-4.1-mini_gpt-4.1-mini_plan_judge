proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic power at wavelength λ. The angular distribution of the radiated power per unit solid angle in the far field typically follows a dipole radiation pattern proportional to sin^2(θ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power per unit solid angle, A, occurs at θ = 90°. To find the fraction of A at θ = 30°, we calculate sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. This means the power at 30° is one quarter of the maximum power A. Regarding wavelength dependence, classical dipole radiation power scales as the fourth power of frequency ω (P ∝ ω^4). Since ω = 2πc/λ, this translates to P ∝ λ^{-4}. Other wavelength dependencies such as λ^{-6} or λ^{-3} correspond to higher multipole or non-standard radiation patterns, which are less consistent with the given problem context. Therefore, the function f(λ, θ) ∝ sin^2(θ) * λ^{-4} fits the physical scenario. Among the given options, choice 3 ('1/4, λ^{-4}') correctly matches both the fraction 1/4 at 30° and the λ^{-4} dependence. Hence, the correct answer is C). This conclusion is supported by classical electrodynamics principles and the known behavior of dipole radiation patterns and their wavelength scaling.

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic power at wavelength λ. Classical electrodynamics tells us that the dominant radiation mode for such a system is dipole radiation, which has an angular dependence proportional to sin^2(θ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. This means the radiation intensity is zero along the axis (θ=0° or 180°) and maximum at θ=90°. Therefore, the maximum power per unit solid angle, A, occurs at θ=90°. The wavelength dependence of dipole radiation power scales as λ^{-4}, because the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency ω, and ω = 2πc/λ. Combining these, the radiated power per unit solid angle can be expressed as f(λ, θ) = C × λ^{-4} × sin^2(θ), where C is a constant chosen so that the maximum power at θ=90° equals A. Evaluating the fraction of A at θ=30°, sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ=30° is 1/4. Among the given options, only choice 3 (1/4, λ^{-4}) matches both the angular fraction and the wavelength dependence consistent with classical dipole radiation theory. Other options either have incorrect angular fractions or incorrect wavelength dependencies inconsistent with physical principles. Hence, the correct choice is C). This conclusion is supported by multiple independent reasonings and aligns with well-established classical electrodynamics results for dipole radiation patterns and their wavelength scaling.
