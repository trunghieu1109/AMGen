proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain produces neutrinos primarily from the beta decay of 8B, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending well beyond 800 keV and contribute significantly to the 800-900 keV energy band (band 2). The 700-800 keV band (band 1) is mainly populated by neutrinos from the pp-II branch, particularly from electron capture on 7Be, which emits neutrinos at discrete energies around 860 keV but also contributes to band 1. The pp-I branch neutrinos are mostly below 420 keV and negligible in these bands. When the pp-III branch suddenly stops, neutrinos from this branch vanish after the neutrino travel time (~8.5 minutes). This causes a significant drop in the flux in band 2, where pp-III neutrinos dominate, while the flux in band 1 remains roughly unchanged because it is dominated by pp-II neutrinos. Before stopping pp-III, the flux in band 2 was much higher due to the pp-III contribution, so the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) was low (around 0.01 or 0.1). After stopping pp-III, the band 2 flux decreases by roughly an order of magnitude or more, while band 1 flux stays about the same, causing the ratio to increase to approximately 10. This conclusion is supported by detailed analyses of solar neutrino spectra and fusion branch contributions, and is consistent across multiple expert opinions. Therefore, the closest answer choice for the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) after the pp-III branch cessation is 10.

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces 8B neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending from low energies (~a few hundred keV) up to about 15 MeV. The two energy bands considered are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Before the hypothetical stoppage of the pp-III branch, band 1 neutrinos come almost exclusively from the low-energy tail of the 8B neutrino spectrum, since other branches (pp-I and pp-II) do not produce neutrinos in this energy range. Band 2 neutrinos are dominated by the monoenergetic 7Be neutrinos at 862 keV from the pp-II branch, with a smaller contribution from the 8B neutrinos of the pp-III branch. When the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the 8B neutrino flux disappears after the neutrino travel time (~8.5 minutes). This causes the flux in band 1 to drop essentially to zero, as it was solely dependent on the pp-III branch. In band 2, only the small 8B contribution is lost, while the large 7Be neutrino flux remains unchanged. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) after the stoppage is approximately the ratio of near zero to a large number, which is about 0.01 (10^-2). This conclusion is consistent with the known solar neutrino spectra and the physics of the proton-proton chain branches. Other options like 0.1, 1, or 10 do not fit the spectral data and the effect of stopping the pp-III branch. Hence, the correct answer is D). This reasoning is supported by multiple independent analyses and is consistent with the physics of solar neutrino production and energy spectra.
