Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_151
proposed answer: Shmoo formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a mating response triggered by pheromone signaling or, in this case, a quorum-sensing peptide. This response leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and activation of a specific transcriptional program necessary for mating. Active chromatin in this context refers to regions engaged in transcriptional activation, where transcription-related protein complexes are present. The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and is expected to be abundant at active promoters during shmoo formation. Enhancer protein complexes, although less well-defined in yeast compared to higher eukaryotes, participate in transcription regulation and are likely associated with active chromatin regions. The nucleosome histone complex forms the fundamental structural unit of chromatin and is present in all chromatin states, active or inactive, so it will be detected in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays targeting chromatin. The pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembles at origins of replication during late M and G1 phases to license DNA replication for the upcoming S phase. However, during shmoo formation, yeast cells arrest in G1 and do not proceed to DNA replication, focusing instead on mating-related transcriptional programs. Consequently, the pre-replication complex is not actively assembled or abundant on chromatin during this state and would be minimally represented in the proteome of active chromatin isolated from shmoo-forming yeast cells. Considering all biological roles, cell cycle phases, and chromatin states, the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be detected in the active chromatin proteome recovered by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry in this experimental context.
