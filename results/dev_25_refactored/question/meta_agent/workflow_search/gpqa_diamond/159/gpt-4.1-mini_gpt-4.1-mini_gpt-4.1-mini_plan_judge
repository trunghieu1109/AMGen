Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_159
proposed answer: The problem involves an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to length a. As N approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circle of radius a. The far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength λ is described by the Airy pattern. The intensity minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum occurs at an angular position θ1 = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture (D = 2a). Thus, θ1 = 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a. The second minimum occurs at approximately θ2 = 2.23 λ / D = 2.23 λ / (2a) = 1.115 λ / a. The angular distance between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 = (1.115 - 0.61) λ / a = 0.505 λ / a. Given the small-angle approximation tan θ ≈ θ, these angular values can be used directly. Among the given choices, 0.506 λ / a (choice D) is the closest and most precise value to the calculated angular distance between the first two minima. Other choices either correspond to the position of the first minimum or are significantly different. Therefore, the correct angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern for the limiting circular aperture is approximately 0.506 λ / a, corresponding to choice D.
