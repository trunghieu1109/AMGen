Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_158
proposed answer: The observed spectral peak at 790 nm is interpreted as the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission line, which has a rest-frame wavelength of 121.6 nm. Using the formula for redshift, z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1, we calculate z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5. Given the Lambda-CDM cosmological model parameters (H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7, flat universe), the comoving distance D_C to an object at redshift z is calculated by integrating the inverse Hubble parameter over redshift from 0 to z. Standard cosmological calculators and numerical integration methods yield a comoving distance around 7.8 to 8 Gpc for z ≈ 5.5. Among the provided options (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc), 8 Gpc is the closest and most reasonable estimate. The options 6 and 7 Gpc underestimate the distance significantly, while 9 Gpc slightly overestimates it. This conclusion is consistent across multiple independent analyses and aligns well with the cosmological parameters and observational data. Therefore, the best choice is 8 Gpc.
