proposed answer: The expectation value of the spin operator along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for the electron in the spin state (3i, 4) is calculated by first normalizing the spin state vector. The norm of the vector (3i, 4) is sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5, so the normalized vector is (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Applying S_y to the normalized state yields (ħ/2) * (-4i/5, -3/5). The conjugate transpose of the normalized state is (-3i/5, 4/5). The expectation value is the inner product ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5), multiplied by ħ/2. Calculating the terms: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = 12 * i^2 / 25 = -12/25 (since i^2 = -1), and (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25. Summing these gives -24/25, and multiplying by ħ/2 yields -12ħ/25. This matches choice B). Other options are either too large or have incorrect signs. This calculation is consistent with quantum mechanics principles, including normalization, operator application, and inner product computation. Therefore, the correct expectation value of S_y for the given state is -12ħ/25, corresponding to choice B).
