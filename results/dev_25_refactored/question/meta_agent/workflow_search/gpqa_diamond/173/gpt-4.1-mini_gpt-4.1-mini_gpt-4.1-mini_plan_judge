proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses m and 2m, where m + 2m = 0.99 M due to a 1% mass defect. This means m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M approximately. The 1% mass loss corresponds to 3 GeV of kinetic energy released and shared between the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta p. The relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment T1 is given by T1 = sqrt((2m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2) - 2m c^2. The classical kinetic energy approximation is T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * 2m). Because the fragments have significant kinetic energy (~GeV scale) compared to their rest mass (~200 GeV scale for the heavier fragment), relativistic effects are small but non-negligible. The classical kinetic energy underestimates the true kinetic energy due to relativistic effects. Detailed calculations and consensus from multiple analyses indicate that the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy and classical kinetic energy for the heavier fragment is about 10 MeV. This difference is small compared to the total kinetic energy but significant enough to be noticed and consistent with relativistic corrections expected in nuclear fission fragments with these parameters. Other options (2 MeV, 5 MeV, 20 MeV) are either too small or too large compared to the precise relativistic correction estimates. Therefore, the best choice is 10 MeV difference, corresponding to choice A).

proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass M = 300 GeV/c^2 splitting into two fragments with rest masses m and 2m, where m + 2m = 0.99 M. Thus, m = 0.33 M = 99 GeV/c^2 and 2m = 0.66 M = 198 GeV/c^2. The momentum p of each fragment is approximately 20 GeV/c. The relativistic kinetic energy T1_rel of the more massive fragment is calculated as T1_rel = sqrt(m1^2 + p^2) - m1 = sqrt(198^2 + 20^2) - 198 ≈ 199.01 - 198 = 1.01 GeV = 1010 MeV. The classical kinetic energy T1_classical is T1_classical = p^2/(2 m1) = 400 / 396 ≈ 1.01 GeV = 1010 MeV. The difference Δ = T1_rel - T1_classical is thus very small. Using a binomial expansion approximation, the difference is about 2.58 MeV, which is closest to 2 MeV among the given options. Although one analysis suggests a difference of about 20 MeV, this likely arises from rounding or approximation errors. Given the velocity ratio v = p/m ≈ 0.1, relativistic corrections are expected to be small but nonzero. The precise binomial expansion and direct calculation support a difference near 2 MeV. Therefore, the most accurate and physically consistent choice for the difference Δ is 2 MeV, corresponding to choice C).
