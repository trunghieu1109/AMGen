Iteration: Test New Architecture_162
proposed answer: To determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is calculated as Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3 × (O (16.00 g/mol) + H (1.008 g/mol)) = 55.85 + 3 × 17.008 = 106.874 g/mol. The moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. The dissolution reaction in acid is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, meaning 3 moles of H+ are required per mole of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, moles of H+ needed = 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. Given the acid concentration of 0.1 M, the volume of acid required is moles / concentration = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm³. This volume represents the minimum acid volume needed to completely dissolve Fe(OH)3. Regarding pH, since the acid volume is just enough to neutralize the hydroxide ions, there is essentially no excess H+ from the acid. However, Fe3+ ions hydrolyze in water producing H+ ions, making the solution acidic with a pH around 2.04. Comparing the calculated values with the given options, choice A (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³) matches the calculated minimum acid volume and expected pH most closely. Other options have either higher acid volumes or pH values inconsistent with the stoichiometric and equilibrium considerations. Therefore, the correct choice is A.

proposed answer: Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16.00 g/mol) + H (1.008 g/mol)) = 55.85 + 3*17.008 = 106.874 g/mol. For 0.1 g, moles = 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. Step 2: Determine moles of H+ required to dissolve Fe(OH)3. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, so 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. Total moles H+ = 3 * 9.36 x 10^-4 = 2.81 x 10^-3 mol. Step 3: Calculate minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed. Volume = moles / concentration = 2.81 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. Step 4: Consider pH after dissolution. Since the acid is strong and monobasic, it fully dissociates. Using the minimum volume means the acid just neutralizes the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3, so there is minimal to no excess acid. However, Fe3+ ions hydrolyze in water, releasing H+ ions, which maintain an acidic pH. Given the very low solubility product (Ksp ~10^-38) of Fe(OH)3, the pH is expected to be low, around 2.04. Step 5: Compare with given options. Option A states pH 2.04 and acid volume 28.05 cm3, which closely matches the stoichiometric calculations and expected pH. Other options have either higher acid volumes or higher pH values inconsistent with the stoichiometric and equilibrium considerations. Step 6: Consider total volume. The problem states total volume is 100 cm3, so the acid volume is part of this total volume. Using 28.05 cm3 acid and the rest water to make 100 cm3 total is consistent. Step 7: Consider other scenarios. Using less acid would not fully dissolve Fe(OH)3; using more acid would increase pH but is not the minimum volume. The problem asks for minimum volume and pH of the resulting solution, so the stoichiometric amount with expected pH is correct. Conclusion: The minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume is approximately 28.05 cm3, and the pH of the resulting solution is about 2.04. This corresponds to option A, which is consistent with rigorous stoichiometric and equilibrium calculations.
