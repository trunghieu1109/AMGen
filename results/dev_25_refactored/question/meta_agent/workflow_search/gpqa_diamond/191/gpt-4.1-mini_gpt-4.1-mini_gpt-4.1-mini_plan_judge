proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius R with a small spherical cavity inside it, displaced by a distance s from the conductor's center. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. We are asked to find the magnitude of the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R. The key electrostatic principle here is that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero, and the conductor's surface is an equipotential. The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the cavity's inner surface and on the outer surface of the conductor. These induced charges rearrange so that the conductor remains neutral overall and the field inside the conductor material is zero. Importantly, from the perspective of any point outside the conductor (distance L > R), the conductor with the cavity and the enclosed charge behaves like a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is because the conductor shields the detailed position of the charge inside the cavity; the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge and its effective position (the conductor's center). Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is given by Coulomb's law as E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), directed radially from the conductor's center to point P. The other given expressions involving l (distance from cavity center to P) or combinations with s and θ relate to the position of the charge inside the cavity and would be relevant if the charge were in free space or if the conductor were absent. However, the conductor's presence and its induced charges ensure that the external field depends only on q and L. Hence, the correct formula for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the one involving L only, which corresponds to choice D). This conclusion holds regardless of the cavity's displacement s or the charge's position inside the cavity, as long as the conductor is uncharged and in electrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the external field is spherically symmetric and centered at the conductor's center, making choice D) the correct answer.
