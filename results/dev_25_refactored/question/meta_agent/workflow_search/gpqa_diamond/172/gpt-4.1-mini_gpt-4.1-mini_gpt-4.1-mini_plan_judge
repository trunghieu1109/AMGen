Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem provides the uncertainty in the electron's position Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^(-10) m and the electron's velocity v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp as Δp ≥ ħ/(2 Δx) = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) / (2 × 1 × 10^(-10)) = 5.27 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The kinetic energy of the electron is given by E = p^2/(2m), and the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated by differentiating E with respect to p: dE/dp = p/m. Since p = mv, dE/dp = v, so ΔE ≈ v Δp. Substituting the values, ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8 m/s) × (5.27 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s) = 1.054 × 10^(-16) J. This value is closest to the choice C) ~10^(-16) J. Although the electron's speed is relativistic (~2/3 the speed of light), the problem does not specify relativistic corrections, and the uncertainty principle is generally applied non-relativistically. The classical kinetic energy formula is acceptable for this estimation. Other choices differ by orders of magnitude and are not consistent with the calculation. Therefore, the best and most reasonable choice is C).
