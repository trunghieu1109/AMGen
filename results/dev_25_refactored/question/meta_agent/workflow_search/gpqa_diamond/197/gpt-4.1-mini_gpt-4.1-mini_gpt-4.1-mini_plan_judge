Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

proposed answer: The problem provides the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate ion concentration [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, along with cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^{2-}, respectively. The blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex corresponds to Co(SCN)2. To find its percentage among all cobalt species, we express the concentration of each species in terms of the free Co(II) concentration x: [Co^{2+}] = x, [Co(SCN)^+] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x, [Co(SCN)2] = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 0.4x, [Co(SCN)3^-] = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 0.063x, and [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x. Summing all cobalt species concentrations equals the total cobalt concentration: 0.01 = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x, so x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is then 0.4x = 0.001692 M. The percentage is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.92%. Comparing this calculated percentage to the given answer choices (16.9%, 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%), the closest match is 16.9%. Other choices are significantly higher and do not correspond to the calculated value. The assumptions made include that the free SCN^- concentration remains approximately 0.1 M due to its large excess, and that only the given complexes and free Co(II) exist in solution. Activity coefficients and other side reactions are neglected as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correct and closest answer is choice A).
