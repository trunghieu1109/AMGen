proposed answer: The luminosity L of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature. Given that both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission, by Wien's displacement law, their surface temperatures T are equal. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends solely on the square of the radius ratio since temperature and constants cancel out. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)² = 2.25. The mass ratio does not affect the luminosity in this context. The radial velocity difference does not affect the intrinsic luminosity because the problem states the peak wavelengths are the same, implying any Doppler shifts have been accounted for or are negligible. Comparing the calculated luminosity ratio (2.25) with the provided answer choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), 2.25 matches exactly choice A). Hence, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. To find the luminosity ratio L1/L2, we use L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴. Given that the observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are equal, but Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength for Star_2 is Doppler shifted. The intrinsic peak wavelength λ_int relates to the observed wavelength λ_obs by the relativistic Doppler formula: λ_int = λ_obs / sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)) for a receding star. Since the observed wavelengths are equal, the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2 is shorter, implying Star_2 is intrinsically hotter. Using Wien's law (λ_peak * T = constant), the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)). Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula gives L1/L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))². Numerically, v = 700 km/s, c = 3 × 10^5 km/s, so v/c = 0.0023333. Then (1 - v/c) = 0.9976667, (1 + v/c) = 1.0023333, ratio = 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99534. Squared = 0.99534² ≈ 0.9907. Radius squared = 1.5² = 2.25. Multiplying: 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228. Comparing with the answer choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), 2.23 is the closest. This calculation carefully accounts for Doppler correction to temperature and thus luminosity, making choice D) the most accurate and justified answer.
