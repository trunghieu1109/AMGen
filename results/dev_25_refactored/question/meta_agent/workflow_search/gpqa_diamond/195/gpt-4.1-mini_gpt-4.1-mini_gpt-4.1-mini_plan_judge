proposed answer: To determine the correct expression for the maximum speed v_max of a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m, spring constant k, amplitude A, and speed of light c, we start from fundamental physical principles involving energy conservation and relativistic mechanics. At maximum amplitude A, the oscillator's velocity is zero, so the total energy is the sum of rest energy and potential energy: E_total = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At zero displacement (x=0), potential energy is zero, so total energy is kinetic plus rest energy: E_total = γmc^2, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. Equating these energies gives γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v_max involves rearranging γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) to v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ^2). Substituting γ yields v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This expression respects the relativistic speed limit (v_max < c), is dimensionally consistent, and reduces to the classical maximum speed sqrt(k/m)A when relativistic effects are negligible (kA^2/(2mc^2) << 1). Evaluating the candidate formulas: Choice A has a plus sign inside the square root and a denominator that can become zero or negative, leading to speeds exceeding c or singularities, which is unphysical. Choice C lacks the c^2 term in the denominator, causing dimensional inconsistency, and also has a plus sign inside the square root, leading to speeds exceeding c. Choice D is purely classical, ignoring relativistic corrections and the speed limit c, so it is only valid in the non-relativistic limit. Only Choice B matches the derived expression exactly, is physically valid, dimensionally consistent, and respects all constraints. Therefore, the correct and physically meaningful expression for the maximum speed v_max is choice B.
