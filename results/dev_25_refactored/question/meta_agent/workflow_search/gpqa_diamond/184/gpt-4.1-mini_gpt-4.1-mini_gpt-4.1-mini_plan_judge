proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε (σ · n), where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices σ each have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, which has units of energy, scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε, which have the correct physical dimension of energy. The factor ħ/2 appears when considering the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. However, the Hamiltonian here is explicitly given in terms of σ, not S, so the eigenvalues do not include ħ/2. If the Hamiltonian were expressed as H = ε (S · n) = ε (ħ/2)(σ · n), then the eigenvalues would be ±ε (ħ/2). But this is not the case here. The options that include ħ/2 (choices B and D) are inconsistent with the given Hamiltonian expression and units. The option with ±1 (choice C) ignores the scaling by ε and the dimension of energy, making it physically incorrect. Hence, the only physically and mathematically consistent eigenvalues are ±ε, corresponding to choice A. This conclusion is supported by the mathematical properties of Pauli matrices, dimensional analysis, and the problem statement.
