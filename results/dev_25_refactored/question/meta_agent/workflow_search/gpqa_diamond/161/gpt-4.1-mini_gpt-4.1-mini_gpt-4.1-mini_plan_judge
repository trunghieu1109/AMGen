proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), which defines a conformal factor that depends on the radius r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The area element induced by this metric is dA = (32 / (4 - r^2)) dx dy. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we integrate this area element over the disk defined by r < 2, since the denominator must be positive to keep the metric well-defined. Changing to polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, so the area element becomes dA = (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dθ. The total area is A = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dθ = 2π ∫_0^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr. To evaluate the radial integral, substitute u = 4 - r^2, so du = -2r dr, or r dr = -du/2. Changing the limits accordingly, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. The integral becomes I = ∫_0^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr = 16 ∫_0^{4} (1/u) du. This integral diverges to infinity because of the singularity at u=0 (corresponding to r=2). Physically, this means the metric blows up at the boundary circle of radius 2, causing the total area to be infinite. Among the given choices, only choice A) '+∞' correctly represents this infinite area. The other options either represent finite expressions or zero, which contradict the divergence found. Therefore, the correct answer is A).
