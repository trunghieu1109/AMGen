Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves two stars with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, and the ratio of excited iron atoms in a specific energy level is observed to be 2:1 between star_1 and star_2. Under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in an excited state follows the Boltzmann distribution: N ‚àù exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy difference between levels and k is Boltzmann's constant. For two stars, the ratio of excited populations is given by N_1/N_2 = exp[-E/(kT_1)] / exp[-E/(kT_2)] = exp[E/k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]. Given that N_1/N_2 = 2, taking the natural logarithm yields ln(2) = (E/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). The difference of reciprocals can be rewritten as (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 T_2). Thus, ln(2) = (E/k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 T_2). The candidate equations differ in algebraic form: Choice A suggests ln(2) = T_2 / T_1, which is dimensionally inconsistent and does not reflect the Boltzmann factor. Choice B has ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)^2, which introduces an incorrect square in the denominator and thus is incorrect. Choice C uses addition in the numerator (T_1 + T_2) / (T_1 T_2), inconsistent with the difference needed in the Boltzmann factor. Choice D correctly states ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 T_2), matching the derived relation except for the factor E/k which is a constant related to the energy difference and Boltzmann's constant and is implicitly considered in the equation. Therefore, choice D correctly captures the temperature relation consistent with the Boltzmann distribution and the observed excitation ratio. This conclusion holds generally under LTE conditions and the assumptions of the Boltzmann population distribution, making choice D the correct and physically meaningful equation relating T_1 and T_2.
