Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data: orbital periods and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for both systems. The orbital periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The RV amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2 are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Assuming circular orbits and edge-on inclination (justified by the eclipsing nature), the RV amplitudes correspond directly to the orbital velocities of the stars around their common center of mass. 

Step 1: Calculate the mass ratio of the two stars in each system using the inverse ratio of their RV amplitudes (since the more massive star moves slower):
- system_1: M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5
- system_2: M1/M2 = 10/15 ≈ 0.6667

Step 2: Use Kepler's third law, which relates the total mass of the system to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the orbital velocities: M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3. Constants and units cancel out when taking ratios, so proportional calculations suffice.

Step 3: Calculate proportional total masses:
- system_1: 2 * (10 + 5)^3 = 2 * 15^3 = 2 * 3375 = 6750
- system_2: 1 * (15 + 10)^3 = 1 * 25^3 = 15625

Step 4: Calculate the ratio of total masses:
- system_1 / system_2 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432

This means system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Among the given options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), ~0.4 is the closest. Other options are significantly farther from the computed value.

All assumptions (circular orbits, edge-on inclination) are reasonable given the eclipsing nature and sinusoidal RV curves. Potential complications like eccentricity or inclination deviations are not indicated and would only add complexity without changing the proportional relationship significantly. Therefore, the best estimate for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.4.
