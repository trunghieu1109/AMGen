Iteration: Test New Architecture_190
proposed answer: The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Step 1 involves treatment with sodium hydride and benzyl bromide, which deprotonates the hydroxyl group on the hydroxymethyl substituent at position 3 and alkylates it to form a benzyloxymethyl ether. The ketone at position 1 and the isopropenyl group at position 5 remain unchanged. Step 2 converts the ketone at position 1 into a tosyl hydrazone using p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl, preparing the molecule for a Shapiro reaction. Step 3 involves treatment with n-butyllithium at low temperature followed by aqueous ammonium chloride. This is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction, which converts the tosyl hydrazone into an alkene at position 1 by elimination of nitrogen and tosylate. The n-BuLi acts as a base to generate the diazo anion intermediate, not as a nucleophile adding a butyl substituent. Therefore, no butyl substituent is introduced at position 1. Step 4 is catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere. This step reduces the isopropenyl group at position 5 to an isopropyl group and also cleaves the benzyl protecting group on the oxygen at position 3, regenerating the free hydroxymethyl group. The alkene formed at position 1 from the Shapiro reaction is also hydrogenated to a saturated alkyl group, effectively converting the former ketone position into a secondary alcohol. Evaluating the product choices: Choice A, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, corresponds to a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl substituent and a hydroxymethyl substituent, consistent with the expected final product after hydrogenation. Choice B is the tosyl hydrazone intermediate, not the final product. Choice C retains the benzyloxy methyl group, inconsistent with hydrogenolysis. Choice D retains the benzyloxy group and introduces a butyl substituent at position 1, inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenolysis. Since the Shapiro reaction does not introduce a butyl substituent and hydrogenation removes benzyl protecting groups, the best match is choice A. This choice reflects the key transformations: benzyl ether cleavage to hydroxymethyl, reduction of isopropenyl to isopropyl, and conversion of the ketone to an alcohol at position 1. Therefore, choice A is the correct structure for product 4.
