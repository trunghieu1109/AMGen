Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1).

proposed answer: The problem involves sequential quantum measurements on a system initially in the state vector (-1, 2, 1). The first measurement is of observable P, and we are interested in the outcome where P=0. The operator P is given by a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues including 0. The post-measurement state after obtaining P=0 is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. This eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Next, the second measurement is of observable Q, and we want the probability of obtaining Q=-1. The eigenspace of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is spanned by the vector (0, 0, 1). The probability of measuring Q=-1 on the post-measurement state is the squared magnitude of the projection of the post-measurement state onto this eigenspace. The projection coefficient is the inner product of (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) and (0, 0, 1), which is -1/√2. Squaring the magnitude gives (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Comparing this with the given choices (1/2, 1/6, 1/3, 2/3), the correct answer is 1/2, corresponding to choice A). This conclusion is consistent with the quantum measurement postulates, normalization of states, and the properties of Hermitian operators representing observables.

proposed answer: To find the joint probability Pr(P=0 and Q=-1), we use the formula Pr(P=0 and Q=-1) = Pr(P=0) * Pr(Q=-1 | P=0). From Sub-task 5, we have Pr(P=0) = 1/3. From Sub-task 6, we have Pr(Q=-1 | P=0) = 1/2. Multiplying these gives (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. This joint probability represents the likelihood that the first measurement of P yields 0 and the subsequent measurement of Q yields -1. Among the given choices, 1/6 corresponds to choice B). This step is crucial because it correctly accounts for the sequential nature of the measurements and the state collapse after the first measurement, which affects the probability of the second measurement outcome. Previous errors likely arose from neglecting to multiply these probabilities or from incorrect normalization. Here, all vectors were normalized, and projections were correctly computed, ensuring the accuracy of the final joint probability.
