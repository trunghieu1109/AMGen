proposed answer: The IR spectrum of compound X shows a broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, characteristic of the O–H stretch of a carboxylic acid, and a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group. The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), typical of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region signals (2.9 ppm multiplet, 1.7 ppm multiplet, 1.4 ppm doublet, and 0.9 ppm triplet) correspond well to a sec-butyl group. Therefore, compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a classical reductive decarboxylation, which removes the carboxylic acid group as CO2 and replaces it with hydrogen, yielding the corresponding alkyl-substituted benzene. Thus, the expected final product is sec-butylbenzene (benzene ring with a sec-butyl substituent in the para position).

Evaluating the given choices:
- Choice A: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene implies a benzene ring substituted with both sec-butyl and methyl groups. This is inconsistent with the starting material and the reaction, which does not introduce a methyl substituent.
- Choice B: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material, not the product after reaction.
- Choice C: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid has different substituents and a different acid structure, inconsistent with the spectral data.
- Choice D: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has different alkyl substituents and does not fit the spectral data.

Since the expected product, sec-butylbenzene, is not explicitly listed among the choices, the closest option is Choice A, which at least contains the sec-butyl substituent on the benzene ring, despite the incorrect presence of a methyl substituent. This discrepancy likely arises from an error or oversight in the provided answer choices. Given the spectral data, reaction mechanism, and the options available, Choice A best approximates the final product.

Therefore, the correct final product based on conformity with spectral and reaction data is Choice A.
