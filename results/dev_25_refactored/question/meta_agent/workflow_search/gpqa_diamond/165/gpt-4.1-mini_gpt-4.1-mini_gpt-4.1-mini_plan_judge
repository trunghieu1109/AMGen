proposed answer: The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 arises from one-loop radiative corrections involving bosonic and fermionic loops in the extended Standard Model. Bosonic loops (from gauge bosons W, Z and scalars h_1, H^±, H^0, A^0) contribute positively to the mass squared, while fermionic loops (top quark t and singlet fermions N_i) contribute negatively due to their opposite statistics. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) x and v break the symmetry and set the mass scale, so the factor (x^2 + v^2) naturally appears in the denominator to give the correct dimension and normalization consistent with effective potential calculations. Examining the choices: Choice A) omits the top quark contribution, which is known to be significant and negative; Choice C) includes the pseudoscalar A^0 with a positive sign, which is expected, but has an extra coefficient α_8 for the fermions and a sign mismatch compared to B; Choice D) incorrectly places (x^2 + v^2) in the numerator, which would give wrong dimensionality for a mass squared formula. Choice B) correctly includes both the top quark and singlet fermion negative contributions, places (x^2 + v^2) in the denominator, and has the proper sign structure for bosonic and fermionic loops. Therefore, choice B) is the most theoretically consistent and physically sound approximation for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass squared generated by radiative corrections in this model.

proposed answer: The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 arises from one-loop radiative corrections involving bosonic and fermionic loops. The formula must be dimensionally consistent, physically complete, and theoretically sound. Dimensional analysis requires that M_{h_2}^2 has dimension mass^2. The terms inside the braces are sums of mass^4 terms multiplied by dimensionless coefficients alpha_i. To obtain mass^2 overall, the prefactor must have dimension 1/mass^2. Since the vacuum expectation values x and v have dimension mass, (x^2 + v^2) has dimension mass^2. Therefore, the prefactor should be 1/(8π^2 (x^2 + v^2)) to ensure correct dimensionality. Choice D) places (x^2 + v^2) in the numerator, resulting in dimension mass^6, which is inconsistent. Physically, the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass receives positive contributions from bosonic loops (h_1, W, Z, H^±, H^0, A^0) and negative contributions from fermionic loops (top quark t and singlet fermions N_i). The top quark has a large Yukawa coupling and must be included with a negative sign. The pseudoscalar A^0 is a physical scalar and must be included positively. Choices A) and B) omit either the top quark or A^0, making them incomplete. Choice C) includes all relevant bosonic and fermionic contributions with correct signs and places the symmetry breaking scale factor in the denominator, ensuring dimensional and physical consistency. The coefficients alpha_i represent coupling strengths and multiplicities and are necessary for weighting each contribution. The summation over N_i accounts for multiple singlet fermions, each contributing negatively. Therefore, choice C) is the most theoretically consistent, dimensionally correct, and physically complete formula for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass squared generated by radiative corrections in the given model.
