proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each pair product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take two possible values: 3 or -1. Specifically, when all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum is 3, and the energy is E = -3J. There are exactly 2 such configurations. For the other 6 configurations, the sum of pairwise products is -1, so the energy is E = +J. The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-βE}. Grouping by energy levels and degeneracies, Z = 2 * e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 * e^{-β(J)} = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Comparing this with the given options, choice A matches exactly this expression. Other options have incorrect coefficients, exponents, or signs. Therefore, the most consistent and correct partition function is choice A.
