proposed answer: The problem involves electrophilic bromination of substituted benzenes, where the substituents influence the regioselectivity of substitution, particularly the yield of the para-isomer. The substituents are: 1) CH3 (methyl), 2) COOC2H5 (ethyl ester), 3) Cl (chlorine), 4) NO2 (nitro), 5) C2H5 (ethyl), and 6) COOH (carboxyl). The key factors are the electronic effects (electron-donating or withdrawing) and steric effects of these substituents. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl and ethyl activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions. Among these, ethyl is bulkier than methyl, which tends to increase para selectivity due to steric hindrance at ortho positions. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro, carboxyl, and ester deactivate the ring and are meta-directing, resulting in low para-isomer yield. Halogens like chlorine are deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance effects, so they produce moderate para-isomer yields. Considering these effects, the order of increasing para-isomer weight fraction is: NO2 (4) < COOC2H5 (2) < COOH (6) < Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). This sequence matches choice B exactly. Other choices either incorrectly order the EWGs or misplace the halogen and EDGs. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer, reflecting the integrated understanding of substituent effects and steric factors on para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination.

proposed answer: The problem requires arranging six substituted benzenes in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The key factors influencing para-isomer yield are the electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and directing effects (ortho/para or meta) of the substituents, as well as steric hindrance. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (CH3) and ethyl (C2H5) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions. Among these, ethyl is bulkier than methyl, which increases steric hindrance at ortho positions, favoring para substitution more strongly. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) has a higher para-isomer fraction than toluene (1). Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (NO2), carboxyl (COOH), and ester (COOC2H5) deactivate the ring and are meta-directing, reducing para substitution. Among these, nitro is the strongest EWG, followed by ester, then carboxyl, so the para-isomer yield increases in the order NO2 (4) < ester (2) < carboxyl (6). Halogens like chlorine (Cl) are unique: they are deactivating by induction but ortho/para directing by resonance. Chlorobenzene (3) thus has a para-isomer yield higher than EWGs but lower than EDGs. Combining all these insights, the order of increasing para-isomer weight fraction is: NO2 (4) < ester (2) < carboxyl (6) < Cl (3) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5). This order matches choice B) '4<2<6<3<1<5'. This conclusion is supported by fundamental organic chemistry principles, substituent electronic and steric effects, and the unique behavior of halogens. All agents in the debate and chain-of-thought analyses converge on this answer, indicating a strong consensus and chemical soundness. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.
