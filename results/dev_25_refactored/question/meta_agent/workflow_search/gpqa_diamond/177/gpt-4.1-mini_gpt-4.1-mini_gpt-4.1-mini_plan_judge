proposed answer: In four-dimensional quantum field theory with natural units (Ä§ = c = 1), the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. The interaction Lagrangian is given by \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). We analyze the mass dimensions of each component: 

1. The Dirac spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2. Therefore, the bilinear \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has mass dimension 3 (since 3/2 + 3/2 = 3).
2. The operator \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_{\mu}, \gamma_{\nu}] \) is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 0.
3. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2.

Multiplying these, the composite operator \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 3 + 0 + 2 = 5.

Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension:
\[ [\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1. \]

A coupling constant with negative mass dimension corresponds to a nonrenormalizable interaction in four-dimensional quantum field theory because it introduces operators of dimension greater than 4, which lead to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

Therefore, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Among the provided options, the one that states \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable is option C). This conclusion is consistent with standard quantum field theory dimensional analysis and renormalizability criteria. Other options either have incorrect mass dimension assignments or incorrect conclusions about renormalizability.
