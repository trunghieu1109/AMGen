Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_182
proposed answer: The starting compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has an initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 5. This is calculated by counting: 1 for the cyclohexane ring, 1 for the double bond in the ring, 1 for the vinyl double bond, 1 for the formyl carbonyl group, and 1 for the carboxylic acid carbonyl group. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, a strong reducing environment, the following transformations are expected: (1) The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3), removing one carbonyl double bond and reducing IHD by 1. (2) The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to an alkyl iodide or methyl group, removing the carbonyl double bond and hydroxyl group, reducing IHD by 1. (3) The vinyl double bond (-CH=CH2) is hydrogenated to an ethyl substituent (-CH2-CH3), reducing IHD by 1. (4) The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated to a single bond, converting it to cyclohexane, reducing IHD by 1. (5) The ring itself remains intact, contributing 1 to the IHD. Summing these changes, the initial IHD of 5 minus 4 reductions equals 1. Alternative scenarios where some double bonds or carbonyl groups remain unreduced would yield higher IHD values (3 or 5), but given the strong reducing conditions and excess HI, full reduction is the most plausible outcome. Therefore, the final product's IHD is 1, corresponding to the ring only.
