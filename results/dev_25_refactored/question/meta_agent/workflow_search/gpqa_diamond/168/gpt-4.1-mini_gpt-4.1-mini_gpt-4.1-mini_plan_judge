Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the energy released is shared among multiple particles (2E and 2V). The presence of multiple emitted particles allows a continuous range of energy partitions due to conservation of energy and momentum, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. When the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M, the number of emitted particles decreases from four (2E + 2V) to three (2E + M). Despite the reduction in particle number, the massless nature of M means it can carry away energy and momentum continuously over a range without a rest mass threshold. This maintains the continuous nature of the E particles' energy spectrum because the energy sharing remains continuous between the two E particles and the massless M. The shape of the spectrum changes due to the altered kinematics and energy partitioning caused by the different particle masses and number. Regarding the endpoint energy, since M is massless, it carries no rest mass energy, unlike the two V particles it replaces, which presumably have finite mass. This reduction in the rest mass energy carried away by the other particles means more total kinetic energy is available to the E particles. Consequently, the endpoint of the total energy spectrum of the E particles increases relative to the original decay. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. This conclusion is consistent with conservation laws, kinematic reasoning, and the physical nature of massless particles, and it aligns with the consensus of multiple analyses.
