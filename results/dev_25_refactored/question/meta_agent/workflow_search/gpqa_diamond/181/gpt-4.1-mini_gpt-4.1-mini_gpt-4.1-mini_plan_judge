proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation models the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device and is derived under specific assumptions. These assumptions are: (1) The device is trap-free, meaning no traps capture carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship. Traps would change the voltage dependence and require a different model. (2) The device is single-carrier, meaning only one type of charge carrier (electron or hole) dominates conduction. Two-carrier conduction complicates the space charge and current distribution, invalidating the simple Mott-Gurney form. (3) The contacts are Ohmic, implying negligible injection barriers, so carriers can be injected freely into the device. Injection barriers, such as those in Schottky contacts, limit carrier injection and thus current, violating the assumption. (4) The current is dominated by drift rather than diffusion, so diffusion current is negligible. This is typically valid at sufficiently high voltages where the electric field drives carrier transport. Negligible diffusion current ensures the quadratic voltage dependence in the equation. Evaluating each choice: Choice A states a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current, perfectly matching all assumptions. Choice B states trap-free single-carrier with Ohmic contact but negligible drift current, which contradicts the assumption that drift dominates; thus invalid. Choice C involves a two-carrier device, violating the single-carrier assumption; invalid. Choice D involves a Schottky contact, which introduces an injection barrier, violating the no-barrier assumption; invalid. Therefore, only choice A correctly describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
