Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_157
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation located in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor subunit. The transcription factor requires dimerization to function properly. Dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains typically act by allowing the mutant protein to still bind to the wild-type protein, forming nonfunctional dimers or higher-order aggregates. This interaction sequesters the wild-type protein into inactive complexes, thereby inhibiting its normal function despite the presence of a wild-type allele. Option A suggests loss of dimerization and a wild-type phenotype, which contradicts the dominant-negative effect because a dominant-negative mutation causes a phenotype, not a wild-type phenotype. Option C suggests protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, which is less common for dominant-negative mutations; these mutations usually interfere by forming defective complexes rather than promoting degradation of the wild-type protein. Option D suggests a gain-of-function phenotype, which is inconsistent with the dominant-negative nature of mutation Y, as dominant-negative mutations generally cause loss-of-function effects. Option B, protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, aligns well with the known mechanism of dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains, where mutant and wild-type proteins form nonfunctional aggregates or complexes that prevent normal transcription factor activity. This explains the dominant-negative effect and loss-of-function phenotype observed in heterozygotes. Therefore, the most plausible molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
