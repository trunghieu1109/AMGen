Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid.

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a significant isotopic peak at m/z = 158 (32%) strongly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom, due to the natural isotopic distribution of 35Cl and 37Cl isotopes. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1, characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, and a sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch typical of carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H, which is consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring, as ortho or meta substitution would produce more complex splitting patterns. The molecular weight and isotopic pattern exclude phenyl chloroformate and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, as their functional groups and molecular weights differ. Between 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic splitting pattern supports para substitution (4-chlorobenzoic acid) rather than ortho substitution (2-chlorobenzoic acid). Therefore, integrating all spectral data and considering molecular formula consistency, the compound is best identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
