proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Starting from benzene, the synthetic route must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the order of reactions to achieve the correct substitution pattern and high yield.

Choice 1 begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group. This group is a strong ortho/para director and bulky, favoring substitution at position 2. Next, nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group meta to the tert-butyl group, which corresponds to position 3 relative to the tert-butyl at position 2. This step is crucial to place the nitro group correctly.

Then, reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (Fe/HCl) allows further functional group transformations. Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts the amino group to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat) is replaced by a hydroxyl group at position 3. This phenol can then be alkylated with NaOH/EtBr to form the ethoxy group at position 1.

Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and subsequent desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) steps can be used as blocking and unblocking strategies to control regioselectivity and prevent undesired substitution during the sequence.

Other choices involve less logical orders, such as multiple nitrations, sulfonation before nitration, or Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an amino-substituted ring, which is problematic due to catalyst poisoning or poor regioselectivity. Therefore, Choice 1 provides the most consistent, logical, and high-yield synthetic pathway to 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, considering directing effects, substitution patterns, and functional group compatibility.

proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group ortho to it at position 2, and a nitro group meta to the ethoxy at position 3. Achieving this substitution pattern with high yield and regioselectivity demands a carefully planned synthetic sequence that respects the directing effects of substituents and functional group compatibility.

Choice 1 starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3) on benzene, introducing the tert-butyl group. This group is bulky, electron-donating, and ortho/para-directing, so subsequent nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) will place the nitro group meta to the tert-butyl group, which corresponds to position 3 in the target molecule. This step is chemically feasible and regioselective.

Next, the nitro group at position 3 is reduced to an amino group using Fe/HCl. The amino group is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing, which allows a second nitration to introduce another nitro group ortho or para to the amino group. Given the positions, nitration occurs at position 1 (para to the amino group), which is the position where the ethoxy group will eventually be installed.

Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts the amino group to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat) is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol at position 3. This phenol is then converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), installing the ethoxy group at position 1.

The sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and subsequent desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) steps serve as temporary blocking groups to control regioselectivity and improve yield by preventing undesired substitution during nitration or other steps.

Choice 2 is invalid because it attempts diazotization before any amino group is present, which is chemically impossible.

Choice 3 introduces sulfonation too early, which strongly deactivates the ring and complicates substitution patterns, reducing yield and regioselectivity.

Choice 4 starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring and hinders Friedel-Crafts alkylation, making tert-butyl introduction difficult and low-yield.

Therefore, Choice 1 is the only sequence that respects the directing effects, functional group compatibility, and synthetic practicality, leading to a high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. It is chemically sound, regioselective, and synthetically efficient, while the other choices fail due to chemical impossibility, poor regioselectivity, or low yield.
