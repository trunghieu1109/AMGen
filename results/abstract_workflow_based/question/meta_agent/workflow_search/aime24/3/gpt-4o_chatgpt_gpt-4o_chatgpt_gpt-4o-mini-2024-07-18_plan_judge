Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections of the graphs, we need to consider the conditions derived in the previous sub-task: 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| are piecewise linear functions with specific periodic behavior. The function f(x) has a period of 1, and g(x) has a period of 1/2. Therefore, the composition g(f(x)) will have a period of 1/2. The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3. Thus, the function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period of 1, and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) has a period of 2/3. The intersections occur when these two functions are equal, which happens at regular intervals determined by the least common multiple of their periods. The least common multiple of 1 and 2/3 is 2. Therefore, the functions will align every 2 units. Within one period of 2, we need to count the number of solutions to the equations 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). By analyzing the behavior of these functions over their respective periods, we find that there are 8 such intersection points within one period of 2. This is because the piecewise linear nature of f and g, combined with the periodicity of sin and cos, results in 8 distinct points where the conditions are satisfied.

Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of intersection points between the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| are piecewise linear and periodic. The function f(x) maps |x| to [0, 0.5], and g(x) maps this to [0, 0.25]. The trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) have periods 1 and 2/3, respectively. The problem reduces to finding when g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). The key values for f(x) are 0, 0.25, and 0.5, corresponding to g(f(x)) being 0.25, 0, and 0.25, respectively. The periodicity and symmetry of the functions lead to 8 intersection points within one period. This conclusion is consistent with the problem's requirements and the intermediate results obtained in the sub-tasks. Therefore, the final answer of 8 intersection points is correct.
