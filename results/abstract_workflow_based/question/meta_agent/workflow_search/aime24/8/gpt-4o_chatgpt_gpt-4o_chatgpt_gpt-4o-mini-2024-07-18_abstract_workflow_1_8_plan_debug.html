    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

### Sub-task 4: Using the pattern or rule identified, calculate the number of losing positions for Alice (winning positions for Bob) for n less than or equal to 2024. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent MZSB:
To determine the number of losing positions for Alice (winning positions for Bob) for n less than or equal to 2024, we use the pattern identified: a position n is a winning position for Bob if n is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. This means we need to count the integers n such that n % 5 == 2 or n % 5 == 3. These correspond to the arithmetic sequences n = 5k + 2 and n = 5k + 3, where k is a non-negative integer. For the sequence n = 5k + 2, the smallest n is 2, and the largest n less than or equal to 2024 is found by solving 5k + 2 &lt;= 2024, giving k &lt;= 404. Similarly, for the sequence n = 5k + 3, the smallest n is 3, and the largest n less than or equal to 2024 is found by solving 5k + 3 &lt;= 2024, giving k &lt;= 404. Therefore, there are 405 integers of the form 5k + 2 and 405 integers of the form 5k + 3. Adding these together gives 405 + 405 = 810. Thus, there are 810 winning positions for Bob.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent MZSB:
810

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Synthesize the results to determine the total number of positive integers n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Synthesize the results to determine the total number of positive integers n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the previous analysis, we determined that Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy if the number of tokens n is such that n is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. This means that for n = 5k + 2 and n = 5k + 3, Bob can always win. We calculated that there are 405 integers of the form 5k + 2 and 405 integers of the form 5k + 3 for n less than or equal to 2024. Therefore, the total number of positive integers n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is the sum of these two counts, which is 405 + 405 = 810.
