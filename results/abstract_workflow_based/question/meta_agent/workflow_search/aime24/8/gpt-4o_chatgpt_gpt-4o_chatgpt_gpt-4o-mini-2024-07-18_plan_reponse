        "response": "To determine the number of winning positions for Bob, we need to identify the positions where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. From the analysis, we know that a position is losing for Alice if it is congruent to 2 modulo 3, meaning Alice cannot force a win from these positions. Therefore, the winning positions for Bob are those that are not congruent to 2 modulo 3, i.e., positions that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. We need to count the numbers n less than or equal to 2024 that are either 3k or 3k + 1. First, consider numbers of the form 3k. The smallest positive integer of this form is 3 (when k=1), and the largest is 2022 (when k=674). So there are 674 numbers of the form 3k. Next, consider numbers of the form 3k + 1. The smallest positive integer of this form is 1 (when k=0), and the largest is 2023 (when k=674). So there are 675 numbers of the form 3k + 1. Therefore, the total number of winning positions for Bob is 674 + 675 = 1349. This count is correct because it includes all numbers that are not of the form 3k + 2, which are the losing positions for Alice.\n\nAnswer:1349",

        "response": "The problem asks for the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. From the analysis in the sub-tasks, we determined that Bob has a winning strategy when the number of tokens n is of the form 5k + 2. These positions are losing positions for Alice, meaning that no matter what move Alice makes, Bob can always respond in a way that leaves Alice in another losing position. We calculated the range of k such that 5k + 2 is less than or equal to 2024, which gives us k <= 404. Therefore, k ranges from 0 to 404, inclusive, resulting in 405 possible values of k. This means there are 405 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. The validation confirmed that this strategy and calculation are consistent with the rules of the game and the analysis of winning and losing positions.\n\nAnswer:405",

        "response": "From the previous analysis, we determined that Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy if the number of tokens n is such that n is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. This means that for n = 5k + 2 and n = 5k + 3, Bob can always win. We calculated that there are 405 integers of the form 5k + 2 and 405 integers of the form 5k + 3 for n less than or equal to 2024. Therefore, the total number of positive integers n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is the sum of these two counts, which is 405 + 405 = 810.\n\nAnswer:810",
