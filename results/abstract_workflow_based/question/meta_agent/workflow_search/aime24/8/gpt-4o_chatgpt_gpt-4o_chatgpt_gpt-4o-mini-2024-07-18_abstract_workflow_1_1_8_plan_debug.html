    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

### Sub-task 1: Analyze the game rules to determine the winning and losing positions for Alice and Bob. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent cIpu:
In combinatorial game theory, a position is a winning position for a player if they can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position if every move leaves the opponent in a winning position. In this game, Alice and Bob can remove either 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. We need to determine the winning and losing positions for both players. Let&#39;s denote a position with n tokens as a winning position for Alice if she can force a win starting from that position, and a losing position if Bob can force a win. We start by analyzing small values of n. For n = 1, Alice can take the last token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who will then win, so n = 2 is a losing position for Alice. For n = 3, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, which is a losing position for Bob, so n = 3 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 5, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob, who can then win, so n = 5 is a losing position for Alice. Continuing this analysis, we find that the losing positions for Alice (and thus winning positions for Bob) are those where n is of the form 5k + 2 for non-negative integers k. This is because from these positions, any move by Alice leaves Bob in a winning position. Therefore, the losing positions for Alice are n = 2, 7, 12, 17, ..., which are exactly the numbers of the form 5k + 2.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent cIpu:
The losing positions for Alice (and winning positions for Bob) are those where n is of the form 5k + 2 for non-negative integers k.

### Sub-task 2: Based on Sub-task 1 output, identify the pattern or strategy that allows Bob to guarantee a win. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent u4mu:
From Sub-task 1, we determined that the losing positions for Alice, which are the winning positions for Bob, occur when the number of tokens n is of the form 5k + 2 for non-negative integers k. This pattern arises because if Alice starts her turn with n = 5k + 2 tokens, no matter whether she removes 1 or 4 tokens, she will leave Bob with a position that is a winning position for him. Specifically, if Alice removes 1 token, Bob will face n = 5k + 1 tokens, and if Alice removes 4 tokens, Bob will face n = 5k - 2 tokens. In both cases, Bob can then make a move that leaves Alice with another losing position. Thus, Bob&#39;s strategy is to always aim to leave Alice with a number of tokens that is of the form 5k + 2 after his turn. This guarantees that Bob will eventually win the game, as Alice will be forced to leave him with a winning position each time.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent u4mu:
Bob can guarantee a win by always leaving Alice with a number of tokens that is of the form 5k + 2 after his turn.

### Sub-task 3: Based on Sub-task 2 output, compute the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 72re:
To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the values of n that are losing positions for Alice. From the analysis, these positions are of the form 5k + 2, where k is a non-negative integer. We need to find the range of k such that 5k + 2 is less than or equal to 2024. Solving the inequality 5k + 2 &lt;= 2024, we get 5k &lt;= 2022, which simplifies to k &lt;= 404.4. Since k must be an integer, the largest possible value for k is 404. Therefore, k ranges from 0 to 404, inclusive. This gives us 404 - 0 + 1 = 405 values of k. Thus, there are 405 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 72re:
405

### Sub-task 4: Validate the computed results by checking the consistency of the winning strategy for Bob. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent X5ro:
The validation of the computed results involves ensuring that the strategy for Bob is consistent and correctly applied. The strategy is based on identifying losing positions for Alice, which are winning positions for Bob, as those where the number of tokens n is of the form 5k + 2. This pattern was derived by analyzing small values of n and observing that from these positions, any move by Alice leaves Bob in a winning position. Specifically, if Alice removes 1 token, Bob is left with 5k + 1 tokens, and if Alice removes 4 tokens, Bob is left with 5k - 2 tokens. Both of these are winning positions for Bob, as they are not of the form 5m + 2. Therefore, the strategy is consistent. Additionally, the calculation of the number of such positions by solving the inequality 5k + 2 &lt;= 2024 gives k &lt;= 404, resulting in 405 such positions. This confirms that the computed result of 405 is consistent with the strategy and the analysis of the game positions.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent X5ro:
The computed result of 405 is consistent with the winning strategy for Bob, as the analysis of the game positions and the strategy for Bob to leave Alice with positions of the form 5k + 2 is correctly applied.

### Sub-task 5: Integrate the validated results to generate the final answer for the query. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent f40c (yourself):
The problem requires us to find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. From the analysis in the sub-tasks, we determined that Bob has a winning strategy when the number of tokens n is of the form 5k + 2. This is because these positions are losing positions for Alice, meaning that no matter what move Alice makes, Bob can always respond in a way that leaves Alice in another losing position. We calculated the range of k such that 5k + 2 is less than or equal to 2024, which gives us k &lt;= 404. Therefore, k ranges from 0 to 404, inclusive, resulting in 405 possible values of k. This means there are 405 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. The validation confirmed that this strategy and calculation are consistent with the rules of the game and the analysis of winning and losing positions.
