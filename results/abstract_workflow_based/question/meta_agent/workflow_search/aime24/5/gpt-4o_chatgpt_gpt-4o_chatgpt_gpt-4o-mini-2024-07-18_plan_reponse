There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

        "response": "The problem involves finding the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to its faces, given that the tetrahedron is symmetric with equal opposite edges. The volume of the tetrahedron has been calculated as 12 * sqrt(2). The distance from the incenter to the faces is given by the formula: distance = 3 * V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where V is the volume and A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of the faces. The areas of the faces are calculated using Heron's formula for each triangular face. After calculating the areas and summing them, the distance is found to be 2 * sqrt(2). To express this distance in the form \\(\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\), we note that 2 * sqrt(2) can be written as \\(\\frac{2 \\sqrt{2}}{1}\\), where m = 2, n = 2, and p = 1. Here, m and p are relatively prime, and n is square-free. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nAnswer:5",

The sum \\( m + n + p = 8 + 2 + 3 = 13 \\) is correctly calculated. The reasoning provided is consistent and agrees with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the final output is verified to be correct.\n\nAnswer:13",
