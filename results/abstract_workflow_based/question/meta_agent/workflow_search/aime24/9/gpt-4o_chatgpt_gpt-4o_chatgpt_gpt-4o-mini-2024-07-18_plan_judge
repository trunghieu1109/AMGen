Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: The probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize is calculated as the conditional probability: P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize). From the previous sub-tasks, we have P(Prize) = 23/42 and P(Grand Prize) = 1/210. Therefore, P(Grand Prize | Prize) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 42/(210*23). Simplifying, 42/210 reduces to 1/5, so the probability becomes 1/(5*23) = 1/115. This fraction is already in simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m+n = 1+115 = 116.

Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is calculated as 1/23. This probability is already expressed in the form m/n, where m = 1 and n = 23. Since 1 and 23 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, m+n = 1 + 23 = 24. The answer to Sub-task 7 is 24. The justification is that the probability was correctly calculated and expressed in simplest form, and the sum of m and n is straightforward to compute. The feedback from Critic Agent Iuil confirms that the m/n expression 1/23 is correct, so the calculation of m+n is also correct.
