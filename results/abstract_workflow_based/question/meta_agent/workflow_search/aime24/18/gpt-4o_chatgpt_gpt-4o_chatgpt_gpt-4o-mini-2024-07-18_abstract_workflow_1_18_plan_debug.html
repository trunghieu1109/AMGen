    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Express OC^2 as a fraction p/q and ensure p and q are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5TLE:
From the previous sub-task, we calculated the distance OC using the distance formula. The point C on the line segment AB was determined to be (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Using the distance formula from the origin O = (0, 0) to C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), we found OC = sqrt((1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2) = sqrt(1/16 + 3/16) = sqrt(4/16) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. Therefore, OC^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The problem asks us to express OC^2 as a fraction p/q where p and q are relatively prime. In this case, OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. The integers 1 and 4 are relatively prime because their greatest common divisor is 1. Thus, the fraction 1/4 is already in its simplest form with p = 1 and q = 4.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5TLE:
1/4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum p + q. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum p + q. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the previous sub-task, we determined that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. These values are relatively prime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. The problem asks for the sum of p and q, which are the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing OC^2. Therefore, we calculate p + q = 1 + 4.
