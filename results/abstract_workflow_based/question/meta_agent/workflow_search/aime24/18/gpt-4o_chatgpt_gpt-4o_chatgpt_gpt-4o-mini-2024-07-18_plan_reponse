        "response": "From the previous sub-task, we determined that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. These values are relatively prime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. The problem asks for the sum of p and q, which are the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing OC^2. Therefore, we calculate p + q = 1 + 4.\n\nAnswer:5",
