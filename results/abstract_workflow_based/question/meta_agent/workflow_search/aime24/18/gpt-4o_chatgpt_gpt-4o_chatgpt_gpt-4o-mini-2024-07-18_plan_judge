Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we determined that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4. These values are relatively prime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. The problem asks for the sum of p and q, which are the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing OC^2. Therefore, we calculate p + q = 1 + 4.

Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: In sub-task 5, it was determined that OC^2 = 13/16, where p = 13 and q = 16 are coprime integers. To find p + q, we simply add these two integers together. Therefore, p + q = 13 + 16 = 29. This matches the answer provided in sub-task 5, confirming the calculation is correct.
