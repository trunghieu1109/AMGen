Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: The inradius of triangle ABC was expressed as 136/1, where m = 136 and n = 1. To find m+n, we simply add these two numbers together. Since m = 136 and n = 1, m+n = 136 + 1 = 137. Therefore, the value of m+n is 137.

The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: The inradius of triangle ABC has been determined to be 17 from the previous sub-task. The inradius is expressed as a fraction in simplest form as 17/1. The numerator is 17 and the denominator is 1. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is 17 + 1 = 18. This is consistent with the previous calculation and explanation provided in sub-task 5.
