        "response": "The inradius of triangle ABC was expressed as 136/1, where m = 136 and n = 1. To find m+n, we simply add these two numbers together. Since m = 136 and n = 1, m+n = 136 + 1 = 137. Therefore, the value of m+n is 137.\n\nAnswer:137",

        "response": "The inradius of triangle ABC has been determined to be 17 from the previous sub-task. The inradius is expressed as a fraction in simplest form as 17/1. The numerator is 17 and the denominator is 1. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is 17 + 1 = 18. This is consistent with the previous calculation and explanation provided in sub-task 5.\n\nAnswer:18",
