    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on r^2. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent NH4e:
Both agents have calculated r^2 as (\frac{\sqrt{657}}{8})^2, which simplifies to \frac{657}{64}. They both agree that 657 and 64 are relatively prime, meaning the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, the final decision on r^2 is \frac{657}{64}. This is consistent with the calculations and simplifications provided, and no further simplification is possible.

### answer by Final Decision Agent NH4e:
657/64

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Based on the output of sub-task 5, find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing r^2. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Based on the output of sub-task 5, find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing r^2. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The output of sub-task 5 gives r^2 as the fraction 657/64. To find the sum of the numerator and denominator, we simply add these two numbers together. The numerator is 657 and the denominator is 64. Therefore, the sum is 657 + 64. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the given fraction.
