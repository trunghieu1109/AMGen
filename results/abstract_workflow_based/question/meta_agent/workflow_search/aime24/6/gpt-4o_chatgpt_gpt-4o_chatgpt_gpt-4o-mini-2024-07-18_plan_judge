Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. The solution to the original problem determined that the maximum diagonal length of such a box leads to a radius squared value of 49/8. This was found by solving the constraints for surface area and volume, and then calculating the diagonal length. The square of the radius is expressed as a fraction 49/8, where 49 and 8 are relatively prime. Therefore, p = 49 and q = 8, and p + q = 57.

The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
proposed answer: The output of sub-task 5 gives r^2 as the fraction 657/64. To find the sum of the numerator and denominator, we simply add these two numbers together. The numerator is 657 and the denominator is 64. Therefore, the sum is 657 + 64. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the given fraction.
