Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
proposed answer: The problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. We are given that 234 residents own exactly three of the three specific items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade. Since these 234 residents own all three of these specific items, and every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents also own a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, these 234 residents own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. The reasoning is consistent with the problem's conditions, as owning exactly three of the specific items implies owning all four when considering the universal ownership of candy hearts.

In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
proposed answer: To find the number of residents who own all four items, we need to consider the information provided in the sub-tasks. Sub-task 5 determined that 234 residents own all three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade). The problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which implies that the residents who own all three items also own a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, the 234 residents who own all three items automatically own all four items, since the fourth item (candy hearts) is owned by everyone. Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as the number who own all three items, which is 234.
