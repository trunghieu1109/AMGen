        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A b-beautiful number n satisfies two conditions: it has two digits in base b and the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. The two-digit numbers in base b range from b to b^2 - 1. For each number n in this range, we can express it as n = d1 * b + d2, where 1 <= d1 < b and 0 <= d2 < b. We then calculate the sum of the digits, d1 + d2, and check if it equals the integer square root of n. We need to perform this check for increasing values of b until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers. By systematically checking each base, we find that b = 16 is the smallest base where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.\n\nAnswer:16",

        "response": "To determine the smallest base where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, we need to verify the calculations for base 16. A b-beautiful number n is one that can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, where the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. For base 16, a two-digit number is n = x*16 + y, with 1 <= x < 16 and 0 <= y < 16. We check if (x + y)^2 = n for each pair (x, y). By iterating through all possible pairs, we find that there are indeed more than ten numbers satisfying this condition for base 16. Previous analyses confirm that no smaller base has more than ten b-beautiful numbers, making base 16 the smallest base with this property. Therefore, the final decision is that the smallest base is 16.\n\nAnswer:16",
