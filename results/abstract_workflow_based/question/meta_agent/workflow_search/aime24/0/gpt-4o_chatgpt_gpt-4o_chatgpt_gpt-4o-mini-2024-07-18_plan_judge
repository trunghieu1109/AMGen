Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
proposed answer: Aya's walking speed s is determined to be 2.5 km/h, and the time spent in the coffee shop t is 24 minutes. We need to calculate the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. The time to walk 9 kilometers at 3 km/h is 9/3 = 3 hours. Including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes. We convert this to minutes: 3 hours is 180 minutes, so the total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. This calculation has been verified as correct multiple times.

When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
proposed answer: Both agents have correctly calculated the total time taken for the walk when Aya walks at speed s+1/2. They determined that s = 2.5 km/h, so s+1/2 = 3 km/h. The time to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is 3 hours. Adding the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Therefore, the final decision on the total time at speed s+1/2 is 204 minutes.
