Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 5: Validate the computed paths to ensure they meet all specified conditions. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BpvQ:
The validation of the computed paths is correct. The problem specifies that we need paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid with exactly four direction changes. This implies that the path must consist of 8 horizontal moves and 8 vertical moves, starting at the lower left corner and ending at the upper right corner. With four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments: three horizontal and two vertical. The lengths of the horizontal segments (h1, h2, h3) must sum to 8, and the lengths of the vertical segments (v1, v2) must also sum to 8. Each segment must have a positive length. The number of ways to partition 8 into three positive parts is given by the binomial coefficient C(7, 2) = 21, and the number of ways to partition 8 into two positive parts is given by C(7, 1) = 7. The total number of valid paths is the product of these two, 21 * 7 = 147. This calculation correctly accounts for all possible ways to distribute the horizontal and vertical moves while ensuring exactly four direction changes, thus validating the computed paths.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BpvQ:
147

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Integrate the validated paths to determine the final count of paths that meet the criteria. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Integrate the validated paths to determine the final count of paths that meet the criteria. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>To determine the final count of paths that meet the criteria, we need to integrate the validated paths from the previous sub-task. The validated paths are those that consist of 8 horizontal moves and 8 vertical moves on an 8x8 grid, with exactly four direction changes. These paths are divided into five segments: three horizontal and two vertical. The number of ways to partition the horizontal moves into three positive parts is 21, and the number of ways to partition the vertical moves into two positive parts is 7. Since these partitions are independent, the total number of valid paths is the product of these two quantities, which is 147. Therefore, the final count of paths that meet the criteria is 147.
