Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
proposed answer: The solution involves finding paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left to the upper right corner, using exactly 8 right (R) steps and 8 up (U) steps, with exactly four direction changes. A path with exactly four direction changes must have the form R-U-R-U-R-U, which means there are three segments of R's and three segments of U's. The number of ways to partition 8 R's into three segments is given by the stars and bars method as C(8+2, 2) = C(10, 2) = 45. Similarly, the number of ways to partition 8 U's into three segments is also C(10, 2) = 45. Each combination of (r1, r2, r3) and (u1, u2, u3) corresponds to a unique path, so the total number of paths is 45 * 45 = 2025. The edge cases are considered, ensuring the path starts with R and ends with U, which is satisfied by the form R-U-R-U-R-U. The calculation correctly accounts for all possible partitions of R's and U's, and the interleaving of segments ensures the path is valid. Therefore, the solution is verified to be correct.

Answer:The solution is verified to be correct, with a total of 2025 valid paths.
Extracted answer: The solution is verified to be correct, with a total of 2025 valid paths.
Correct answer: 294

proposed answer: To determine the final count of paths that meet the criteria, we need to integrate the validated paths from the previous sub-task. The validated paths are those that consist of 8 horizontal moves and 8 vertical moves on an 8x8 grid, with exactly four direction changes. These paths are divided into five segments: three horizontal and two vertical. The number of ways to partition the horizontal moves into three positive parts is 21, and the number of ways to partition the vertical moves into two positive parts is 7. Since these partitions are independent, the total number of valid paths is the product of these two quantities, which is 147. Therefore, the final count of paths that meet the criteria is 147.
