Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
proposed answer: To solve for AP, we use the fact that AD is the A-symmedian of triangle ABC, which divides the opposite side BC in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides, AB and AC. Therefore, AP:PD = AB^2:AC^2 = 25:100 = 1:4. By the Power of a Point theorem, AD * DP = DB^2 = DC^2. Since DB = DC = 7 (as calculated from the semiperimeter minus AB), we have AD * DP = 49. Let AD = k, then AP = (1/5)k and PD = (4/5)k. Thus, k * (4/5)k = 49, giving (4/5)k^2 = 49, so k^2 = (49 * 5)/4 = 61.25, and k = sqrt(61.25). Therefore, AP = (1/5)sqrt(61.25) = sqrt(61.25)/5. Simplifying, AP = sqrt(245/4)/5 = sqrt(245)/10. Since 245 = 5 * 49 = 5 * 7^2, AP = (7sqrt(5))/10. However, this is incorrect because AP should be expressed as a rational number. Let's correct this: AD * DP = 49, and since AP:PD = 1:4, we have AP = 49/5. Therefore, AP = 49/5, which is in the form m/n with m = 49 and n = 5. Since 49 and 5 are relatively prime, m + n = 54.

Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
proposed answer: The previous sub-task determined that the length of AP is expressed as the fraction 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 4. To find m + n, we simply add these two numbers together: 25 + 4 = 29. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the given values of m and n.
