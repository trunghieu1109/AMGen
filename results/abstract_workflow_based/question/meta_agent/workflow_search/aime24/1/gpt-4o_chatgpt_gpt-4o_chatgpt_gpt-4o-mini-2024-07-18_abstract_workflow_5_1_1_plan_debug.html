    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Express AP in the form of a fraction m/n and ensure m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent fiJ0:
The length of AP has been determined to be 25/4. To express this in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime, we note that 25 and 4 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction 25/4 is already in its simplest form, with m = 25 and n = 4. Since 25 and 4 are relatively prime, we can conclude that m = 25 and n = 4 are correct. Thus, m + n = 25 + 4 = 29.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent fiJ0:
29

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Calculate m + n to find the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 8: Calculate m + n to find the final answer. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The previous sub-task determined that the length of AP is expressed as the fraction 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 4. To find m + n, we simply add these two numbers together: 25 + 4 = 29. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the given values of m and n.
