        "response": "The product of all terms from sub-task 2 is 531441. To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we compute 531441 mod 1000. The remainder of a number when divided by 1000 is simply the last three digits of that number. The last three digits of 531441 are 441, which is the remainder when 531441 is divided by 1000. Therefore, the remainder is 441. This calculation is straightforward and has been verified multiple times in the previous sub-tasks.\n\nAnswer:441",
