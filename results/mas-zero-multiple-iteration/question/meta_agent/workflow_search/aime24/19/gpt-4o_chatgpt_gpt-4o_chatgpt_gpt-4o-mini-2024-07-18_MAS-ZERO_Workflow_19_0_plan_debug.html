Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000..

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Oypz:
From the output of sub-task 1, we have the values of the expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) for each k from 0 to 12. Specifically, for k = 0, the value is 1, and for k = 1 to 12, the value is 3. Therefore, the product of all these terms is: (2 - 2*omega^0 + omega^(2*0)) * (2 - 2*omega^1 + omega^(2*1)) * ... * (2 - 2*omega^12 + omega^(2*12)) = 1 * 3^12. We need to compute 3^12 to find this product. 3^12 = (3^6)^2 = 729^2. Calculating 729^2 gives us 531441. Therefore, the product of all terms is 531441.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CMsh (yourself):
The product of all terms from sub-task 2 is 531441. To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we need to compute 531441 mod 1000. The last three digits of 531441 are 441, which is the remainder when 531441 is divided by 1000. Therefore, the remainder is 441.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CMsh (yourself):
441

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, review the remainder calculation and refine if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent SfNU:
The remainder calculation appears to be correct. The product given was 531441, and the remainder when dividing by 1000 is indeed the last three digits of the number, which are 441.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CMsh (yourself):
The product of all terms from sub-task 2 is 531441. To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we need to compute 531441 mod 1000. The last three digits of 531441 are 441, which is the remainder when 531441 is divided by 1000. Therefore, the remainder is 441. This calculation is straightforward because the remainder of a number when divided by 1000 is simply the last three digits of that number.
