\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: 4
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses a variable 'cot_reflect_instruction_3' on the line where 'cot_agent_3' is called, but this variable is never declared within the function. This results in an undeclared variable error. All other variables are declared before use, including loop variables and function parameters.
