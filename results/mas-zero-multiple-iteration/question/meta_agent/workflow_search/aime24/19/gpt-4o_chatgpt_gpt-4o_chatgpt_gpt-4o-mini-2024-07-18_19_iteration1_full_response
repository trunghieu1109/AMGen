\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: 1
Variables Checking: The function uses the variable 'cot_reflect_instruction_3' on the line where 'thinking3, answer3' is assigned, but 'cot_reflect_instruction_3' is never declared within the function. This results in an undeclared variable error. All other variables are declared before use.
