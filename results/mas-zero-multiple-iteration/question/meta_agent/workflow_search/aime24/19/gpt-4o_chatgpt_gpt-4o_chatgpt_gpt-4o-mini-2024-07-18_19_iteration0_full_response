Let omega be a primitive 13th root of unity, so omega^13 = 1 and omega^k for k = 0, 1, ..., 12 are all distinct roots of unity. The expression simplifies as follows: 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) = (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1. This is because (1 - omega^k)^2 = 1 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k). Therefore, for each k, we compute (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1. Since omega^k are roots of unity, we know that omega^k = cos(2πk/13) + i*sin(2πk/13). The expression (1 - omega^k) is a complex number, and its square plus 1 gives us the desired result. We compute this for each k from 0 to 12.; answer: For k = 0, 2 - 2*omega^0 + omega^(2*0) = 1. For k = 1, 2 - 2*omega^1 + omega^(2*1) = 3. For k = 2, 2 - 2*omega^2 + omega^(2*2) = 3. For k = 3, 2 - 2*omega^3 + omega^(2*3) = 3. For k = 4, 2 - 2*omega^4 + omega^(2*4) = 3. For k = 5, 2 - 2*omega^5 + omega^(2*5) = 3. For k = 6, 2 - 2*omega^6 + omega^(2*6) = 3. For k = 7, 2 - 2*omega^7 + omega^(2*7) = 3. For k = 8, 2 - 2*omega^8 + omega^(2*8) = 3. For k = 9, 2 - 2*omega^9 + omega^(2*9) = 3. For k = 10, 2 - 2*omega^10 + omega^(2*10) = 3. For k = 11, 2 - 2*omega^11 + omega^(2*11) = 3.
