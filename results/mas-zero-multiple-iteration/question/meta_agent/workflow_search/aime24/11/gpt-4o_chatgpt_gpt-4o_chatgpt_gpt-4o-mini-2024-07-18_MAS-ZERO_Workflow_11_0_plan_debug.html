Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4uDQ:
To calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration, we need to determine how the 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s can be partitioned into the segments specified by each configuration. For each segment, we count the number of ways to distribute the required number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. 

1. Configuration (R-U-R-U-R): We have 3 segments of R&#39;s and 2 segments of U&#39;s. Let the number of R&#39;s in the segments be a, b, c and the number of U&#39;s be x, y. We have a + b + c = 8 and x + y = 8. Additionally, there are 4 changes, so we have a + x = b, b + y = c, and c + x = 8. Solving these, we get a = c = 2 and b = 4, x = y = 4. The number of paths is given by the multinomial coefficient: (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 4, 4) = 420 * 70 = 29400.

2. Configuration (U-R-U-R-U): Similarly, we have 3 segments of U&#39;s and 2 segments of R&#39;s. Let the number of U&#39;s be a, b, c and the number of R&#39;s be x, y. We have a + b + c = 8 and x + y = 8. Solving these, we get a = c = 2, b = 4, x = y = 4. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 4, 4) = 420 * 70 = 29400.

3. Configuration (R-U-R-U-U): We have 3 segments of R&#39;s and 2 segments of U&#39;s, but with 2 consecutive U&#39;s at the end. Let the number of R&#39;s be a, b, c and the number of U&#39;s be x, y. We have a + b + c = 8 and x + y = 8, with the condition that the last segment is U-U. Solving these, we find a = c = 2, b = 4, x = 2, y = 6. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 2, 6) = 420 * 28 = 11760.

4. Configuration (U-R-U-R-R): We have 2 segments of U&#39;s and 3 segments of R&#39;s, with 2 consecutive R&#39;s at the end. Let the number of U&#39;s be a, b and the number of R&#39;s be x, y, z. We have a + b = 8 and x + y + z = 8, with the condition that the last segment is R-R. Solving these, we find a = 2, b = 6, x = 2, y = 4, z = 2. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 6) * (8 choose 2, 4, 2) = 28 * 420 = 11760.

5. Configuration (R-R-U-R-U): We have 3 segments of R&#39;s and 2 segments of U&#39;s, with 2 consecutive R&#39;s at the start. Let the number of R&#39;s be x, y, z and the number of U&#39;s be a, b. We have x + y + z = 8 and a + b = 8, with the condition that the first segment is R-R. Solving these, we find x = 2, y = 4, z = 2, a = 2, b = 6. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 2, 6) = 420 * 28 = 11760.

6. Configuration (U-U-R-U-R): We have 2 segments of U&#39;s and 3 segments of R&#39;s, with 2 consecutive U&#39;s at the start. Let the number of U&#39;s be x, y and the number of R&#39;s be a, b, c. We have x + y = 8 and a + b + c = 8, with the condition that the first segment is U-U. Solving these, we find x = 2, y = 6, a = 2, b = 4, c = 2. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 6) * (8 choose 2, 4, 2) = 28 * 420 = 11760.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent mcZH (yourself):
To find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times, we need to sum the number of paths for each configuration provided in the output of sub-task 2. The configurations and their corresponding number of paths are: Configuration 1 (R-U-R-U-R): 29400 paths, Configuration 2 (U-R-U-R-U): 29400 paths, Configuration 3 (R-U-R-U-U): 11760 paths, Configuration 4 (U-R-U-R-R): 11760 paths, Configuration 5 (R-R-U-R-U): 11760 paths, Configuration 6 (U-U-R-U-R): 11760 paths. Adding these together gives the total number of paths: 29400 + 29400 + 11760 + 11760 + 11760 + 11760 = 105240.
