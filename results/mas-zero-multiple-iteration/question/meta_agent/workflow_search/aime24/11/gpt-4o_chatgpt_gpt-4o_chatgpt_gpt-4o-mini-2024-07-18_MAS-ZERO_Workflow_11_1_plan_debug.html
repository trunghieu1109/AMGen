Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 1.2: Based on the output of sub-task 1.1, calculate the number of valid paths for each block pattern using combinatorial methods. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0LTU:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of valid paths for each block pattern identified in sub-task 1.1. The patterns are R-U-R-U-R and U-R-U-R-U, each with exactly four changes in direction. For the pattern R-U-R-U-R, we have three blocks of R&#39;s and two blocks of U&#39;s. We need to partition 8 R&#39;s into three positive parts and 8 U&#39;s into two positive parts. Using the stars and bars method, the number of ways to partition 8 R&#39;s into three parts is (8-1) choose (3-1) = 7 choose 2 = 21. The number of ways to partition 8 U&#39;s into two parts is (8-1) choose (2-1) = 7 choose 1 = 7. Therefore, the total number of paths for the pattern R-U-R-U-R is 21 * 7 = 147. Similarly, for the pattern U-R-U-R-U, we have three blocks of U&#39;s and two blocks of R&#39;s. The number of ways to partition 8 U&#39;s into three parts is 21, and the number of ways to partition 8 R&#39;s into two parts is 7. Therefore, the total number of paths for the pattern U-R-U-R-U is also 21 * 7 = 147. Adding these together gives the total number of paths with exactly four changes in direction: 147 + 147 = 294.

    <pre>The problem involves finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, with exactly 16 steps (8 right and 8 up), that change direction exactly four times. The solution involves considering two patterns: R-U-R-U-R and U-R-U-R-U, each with four direction changes. For each pattern, we use combinatorial methods to partition the steps into blocks. For R-U-R-U-R, we partition 8 R&#39;s into three positive parts and 8 U&#39;s into two positive parts, which gives 21 * 7 = 147 paths. Similarly, for U-R-U-R-U, we partition 8 U&#39;s into three positive parts and 8 R&#39;s into two positive parts, also giving 147 paths. The total number of paths is the sum of the paths for both patterns: 147 + 147 = 294.
