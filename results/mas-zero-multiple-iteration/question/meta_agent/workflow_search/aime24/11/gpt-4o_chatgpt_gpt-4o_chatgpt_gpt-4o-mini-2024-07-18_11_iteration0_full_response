For each segment, we count the number of ways to distribute the required number of R\'s and U\'s. \n\n1. Configuration (R-U-R-U-R): We have 3 segments of R\'s and 2 segments of U\'s. Let the number of R\'s in the segments be a, b, c and the number of U\'s be x, y. We have a + b + c = 8 and x + y = 8. Additionally, there are 4 changes, so we have a + x = b, b + y = c, and c + x = 8. Solving these, we get a = c = 2 and b = 4, x = y = 4. The number of paths is given by the multinomial coefficient: (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 4, 4) = 420 * 70 = 29400.\n\n2. Configuration (U-R-U-R-U): Similarly, we have 3 segments of U\'s and 2 segments of R\'s. Let the number of U\'s be a, b, c and the number of R\'s be x, y. We have a + b + c = 8 and x + y = 8. Solving these, we get a = c = 2, b = 4, x = y = 4. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 4, 4) = 420 * 70 = 29400.\n\n3.

We have a + b + c = 8 and x + y = 8, with the condition that the last segment is U-U. Solving these, we find a = c = 2, b = 4, x = 2, y = 6. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 4, 2) * (8 choose 2, 6) = 420 * 28 = 11760.\n\n4. Configuration (U-R-U-R-R): We have 2 segments of U\'s and 3 segments of R\'s, with 2 consecutive R\'s at the end.

Solving these, we find a = 2, b = 6, x = 2, y = 4, z = 2. The number of paths is (8 choose 2, 6) * (8 choose 2, 4, 2) = 28 * 420 = 11760.\n\n5.

Since we have 8 R's and 8 U's, we can partition these moves into segments where each segment consists of consecutive R's or U's.
