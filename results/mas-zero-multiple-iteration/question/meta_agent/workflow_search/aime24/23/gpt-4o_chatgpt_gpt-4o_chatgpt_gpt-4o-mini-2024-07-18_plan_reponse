        "response": "To solve Sub-task 5, we need to identify the combinations that satisfy both conditions from Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4. Sub-task 3 provides combinations where the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. Sub-task 4 provides combinations where the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Both conditions are satisfied when each digit in the top row, when added to the corresponding digit in the bottom row, results in 9. This ensures that the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, and the sum of the numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. The valid combinations are those where the top row digits (a, b, c) and the bottom row digits (d, e, f) satisfy a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9, with d being at least 1 to form a valid three-digit number. The common combinations are those listed in Sub-task 3, as they inherently satisfy the condition from Sub-task 4 due to the digit sum constraints.\n\nAnswer:The common combinations that satisfy both conditions are: (0, 0, 9) and (9, 9, 0), (0, 1, 8) and (9, 8, 1), (0, 2, 7) and (9, 7, 2), (0, 3, 6) and (9, 6, 3), (0, 4, 5) and (9, 5, 4), (0, 5, 4) and (9, 4, 5), (0, 6, 3) and (9, 3, 6), (0, 7, 2) and (9, 2, 7), (0, 8, 1) and (9, 1, 8), (0, 9, 0) and (9, 0, 9), (1, 0, 8) and (8, 9, 1), (1, 1, 7) and (8, 8, 2), (1, 2, 6) and (8, 7, 3), (1, 3, 5) and (8, 6, 4), (1, 4, 4) and (8, 5, 5), (1, 5, 3) and (8, 4, 6), (1, 6, 2) and (8, 3, 7), (1, 7, 1) and (8, 2, 8), (1, 8, 0) and (8, 1, 9), (2, 0, 7) and (7, 9, 2), (2, 1, 6) and (7, 8, 3), (2, 2, 5) and (7, 7, 4), (2, 3, 4) and (7, 6, 5), (2, 4, 3) and (7, 5, 6), (2, 5, 2) and (7, 4, 7), (2, 6, 1) and (7, 3, 8), (2, 7, 0) and (7, 2, 9), (3, 0, 6) and (6, 9, 3), (3, 1, 5) and (6, 8, 4), (3, 2, 4) and (6, 7, 5), (3, 3, 3) and (6, 6, 6), (3, 4, 2) and (6, 5, 7), (3, 5, 1) and (6, 4, 8), (3, 6, 0) and (6, 3, 9), (4, 0, 5) and (5, 9, 4), (4, 1, 4) and (5, 8, 5), (4, 2, 3) and (5, 7, 6), (4, 3, 2) and (5, 6, 7), (4, 4, 1) and (5, 5, 8), (4, 5, 0) and (5, 4, 9), (5, 0, 4) and (4, 9, 5), (5, 1, 3) and (4, 8, 6), (5, 2, 2) and (4, 7, 7), (5, 3, 1) and (4, 6, 8), (5, 4, 0) and (4, 5, 9), (6, 0, 3) and (3, 9, 6), (6, 1, 2) and (3, 8, 7), (6, 2, 1) and (3, 7, 8), (6, 3, 0) and (3, 6, 9), (7, 0, 2) and (2, 9, 7), (7, 1, 1) and (2, 8, 8), (7, 2, 0) and (2, 7, 9), (8, 0, 1) and (1, 9, 8), (8, 1, 0) and (1, 8, 9), (9, 0, 0) and (0, 9, 9).",
