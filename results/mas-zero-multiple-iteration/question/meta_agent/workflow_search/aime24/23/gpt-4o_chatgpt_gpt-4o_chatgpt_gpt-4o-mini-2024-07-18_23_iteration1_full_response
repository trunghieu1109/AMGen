Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables that are declared before use, including 'taskInfo', 'thinking_top', 'answer_top', 'thinking_bottom', 'answer_bottom', 'thinking_lr', 'answer_lr', 'thinking_tb', 'answer_tb', 'thinking_common', and 'answer_common'. However, the variable 'sc_instruction_common' is used in the call to 'sc_agent_common' but is never declared within the function. This results in an undeclared variable error.
