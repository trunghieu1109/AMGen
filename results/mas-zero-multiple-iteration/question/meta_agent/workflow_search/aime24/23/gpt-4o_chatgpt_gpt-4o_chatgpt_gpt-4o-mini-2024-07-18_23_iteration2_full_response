Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: 2
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses a variable 'sc_instruction_common' on line 88, which is undeclared within the function's scope. All other variables are declared before use, including loop variables and function parameters. The 'self' reference is assumed to be part of a class and is not considered undeclared. Therefore, the only undeclared variable is 'sc_instruction_common'.
