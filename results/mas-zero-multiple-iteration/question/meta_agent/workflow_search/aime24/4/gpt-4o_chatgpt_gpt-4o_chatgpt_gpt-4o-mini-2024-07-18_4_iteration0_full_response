This implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For this to happen, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We start by checking small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 is either 0 or 1 modulo 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Checking n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, we find that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9) is not possible. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25).
