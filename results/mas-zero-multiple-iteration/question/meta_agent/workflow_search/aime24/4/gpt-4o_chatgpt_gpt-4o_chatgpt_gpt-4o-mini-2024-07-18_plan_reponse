        "response": "From sub-task 1, we determined that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 5. Therefore, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 = 25. We check small values of m to find the smallest one that satisfies this condition. For m = 1, m^4 + 1 = 1^4 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 2, m^4 + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 3, m^4 + 1 = 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 4, m^4 + 1 = 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 5, m^4 + 1 = 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is m = 5.\n\nAnswer:5",
