Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The point C is given as (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). To find OC^2, we use the distance formula from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/4, sqrt(3)/4). The formula for the square of the distance is OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2. Calculating this, we have (1/4)^2 = 1/16 and (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 3/16. Adding these gives 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. The fraction 1/4 is already in its simplest form, with p = 1 and q = 4. Since 1 and 4 are relatively prime, they satisfy the condition for p and q being relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the sum of p and q is 1 + 4.
