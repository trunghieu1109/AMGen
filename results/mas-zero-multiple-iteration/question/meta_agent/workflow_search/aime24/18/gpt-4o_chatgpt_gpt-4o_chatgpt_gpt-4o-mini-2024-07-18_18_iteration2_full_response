Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables, and I will analyze each one to ensure they are declared before use. The function parameters 'self' and 'taskInfo' are declared as part of the function signature. The variable 'sub_tasks' is declared on line 3, 'agents' on line 4, 'cot_instruction_1' on line 7, 'cot_agent_1' on line 8, 'thinking_1' and 'answer_1' on line 9, 'cot_instruction_2' on line 14, 'N' on line 15, 'cot_agents_2' on line 16, 'thinking_mapping_2' and 'answer_mapping_2' on line 17, 'possible_answers_2' on line 18, 'i' on line 19, 'answer_2' on line 25, 'thinking_2' on line 26, 'cot_instruction_3_1' on line 30, 'cot_agent_3_1' on line 31, 'thinking_3_1' and 'answer_3_1' on line 32, 'cot_instruction_3_2_1' on line 36, 'reflexion_agent_3_2_1' on line 37, 'thinking_3_2_1' and 'answer_3_2_1' on line 38, 'cot_instruction_3_2_2' on line 42, 'reflexion_agent_3_2_2' on line 43, 'thinking_3_2_2' and 'answer_3_2_2' on line 44, 'debate_agents_4' on line 48, 'max_round_4' on line 49, 'all_thinking_4' and 'all_answer_4' on line 50, 'r' on line 51, 't_4' and 'a_4' on line 54, 'input_infos_4' on line 56, 'final_decision_agent_4' on line 60, 'thinking_4' and 'answer_4' on line 61, and 'final_answer' on line 66. The variable 'debate_instruction_4' is used on line 54 and 61 but is never declared within the function, which is an undeclared variable error. All other variables are declared before use. Therefore, there is an undeclared variable error with 'debate_instruction_4'.
