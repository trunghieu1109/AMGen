Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency was calculated as 12 in sub-task 3. This difference can be expressed as the fraction 12/1, which is already in its simplest form because the greatest common divisor of 12 and 1 is 1. Therefore, the numerator m is 12 and the denominator n is 1. The sum of m and n is 12 + 1 = 13. This confirms that the expression is already simplified and the sum is correctly calculated.
