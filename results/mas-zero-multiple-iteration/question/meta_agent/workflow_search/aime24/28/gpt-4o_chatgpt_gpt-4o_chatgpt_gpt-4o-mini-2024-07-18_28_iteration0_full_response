Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

The radius of the circle being revolved is 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution is 6. This means the torus has a 'tube radius' of 3 and a 'revolution radius' of 6. The 'tube radius' is the radius of the circle being revolved, and the 'revolution radius' is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution.; answer: The radius of the torus is 3, and its revolution distance is 6.\nCoT-SC agent V5Al, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus has a 'tube radius' of 3 and a 'revolution radius' of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube must be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the tube's radius. The center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the center of the tube, so the total distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 + 3 = 9. Thus, the condition for tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere is that the sum of the sphere's radius and the tube's radius is equal to the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube. This condition ensures that the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, and the radius of this circle is determined by the geometry of the torus and sphere intersection.; answer: The conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube (9) must equal the sum of the sphere's radius (11) and the tube's radius (3) for external tangency. This ensures that the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle.\nCoT-SC agent KhK2, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a revolution radius of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus to be tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's revolution radius. The torus can be externally tangent to the sphere in two configurations: when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere (external tangency) and when the torus rests inside the sphere (internal tangency). In the external tangency case, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. In the internal tangency case, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. The radii of the circles of tangency are determined by the tube radius of the torus, which is 3.; answer: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17. For internal tangency, the distance is 5.\nCoT-SC agent 5th1, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere must equal the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's revolution radius plus or minus the tube radius. The torus has a revolution radius of 6 and a tube radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 11 + 6 = 17. At this position, the torus is tangent along a circle of radius 3 (the tube radius). When the torus is internally tangent, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5, and the torus is tangent along a circle of radius 0, since the tube 'sinks' into the sphere. However, we should also consider the case where the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along the outside of its tube, which would mean the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 + 3 = 20, and the torus is tangent along a circle of radius 3 again. Therefore, the conditions for tangency are: 1) At a distance of 17, tangency occurs along a circle of radius 3. 2) At a distance of 20, tangency occurs along a circle of radius 0. The difference in the radii of tangency circles is 3 - 0 = 3.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: 1) At a distance of 17 from the center of the sphere, the torus is tangent along a circle of radius 3. 2) At a distance of 20 from the center of the sphere, the torus is tangent along a circle of radius 0.\nCoT agent FJNK, on the purpose of calculating difference in radii, thinking: The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a revolution radius of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is 11 + 3 = 14. The center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the center of the tube, so the total distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14. The radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is 6 - 3 = 3. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is 6 + 3 = 9. The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is 9 - 3 = 6. However, the problem asks for the difference in the form of a fraction, so we write it as 6/1.

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube should be 11 + 6 = 17, not 14. The radius of the circle of tangency in this case is 17 - 11 = 6. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube should be 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency in this case is 11 - 5 = 6. Therefore, the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is 6 - 6 = 0, not 6.

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is 11 + 6 = 17, which is correct. However, the radius of the circle of tangency is not 17 - 11 = 6. Instead, it should be 17 - 3 = 14, because the circle of tangency is on the surface of the torus, which is 3 units away from the center of the torus's tube. Similarly, when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's tube is 11 - 6 = 5, which is correct. The radius of the circle of tangency in this case should be 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is 14 - 2 = 12.
