Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables, and all of them are declared before use. The parameters 'taskInfo' and 'self' are provided as part of the function signature. The variable 'cot_reflect_instruction_3_3' is used in the call to 'cot_agent_3_3', but it is not declared anywhere in the function, which is an undeclared variable error. All other variables, including loop variables and those used in list comprehensions, are properly declared before use.
