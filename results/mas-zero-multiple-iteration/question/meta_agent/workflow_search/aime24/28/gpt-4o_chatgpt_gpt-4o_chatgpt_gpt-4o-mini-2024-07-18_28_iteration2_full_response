Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Variables Checking: Upon reviewing the function, I identified an undeclared variable issue. The variable 'cot_reflect_instruction_3_3_2' is used as an argument in the call to 'cot_agent_3_3_2' but is never declared within the function. This results in an undeclared variable error at the line where 'cot_agent_3_3_2' is called. All other variables are properly declared before use.
