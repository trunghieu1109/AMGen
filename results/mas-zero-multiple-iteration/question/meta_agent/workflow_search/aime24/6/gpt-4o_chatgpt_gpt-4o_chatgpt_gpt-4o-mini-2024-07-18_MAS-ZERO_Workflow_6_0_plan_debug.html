    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the fraction representing r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Pori:
The fraction representing r^2 is \( \frac{531}{4} \). To simplify this fraction, we need to check if 531 and 4 have any common factors other than 1. The number 531 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. Checking divisibility by 3, the sum of the digits of 531 is 9, which is divisible by 3, and indeed 531 is divisible by 3 as 531/3 = 177. However, 4 is a power of 2 and does not share any factors with 177 other than 1. Therefore, 531 and 4 are relatively prime, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is 531 + 4 = 535.

### thinking by Debate Agent gVKc:
The fraction representing r^2 is \( \frac{531}{4} \). To simplify this fraction, we check if 531 and 4 have any common factors. Since 531 is not divisible by 2, and 4 is a power of 2, they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Thus, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 531 + 4 = 535.
