Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The fraction representing r^2 is given as \( \frac{531}{4} \). To simplify this fraction, we need to determine if 531 and 4 have any common factors. Since 531 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2, and 4 is a power of 2, they do not share any common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction \( \frac{531}{4} \) is already in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is 531 + 4 = 535.
