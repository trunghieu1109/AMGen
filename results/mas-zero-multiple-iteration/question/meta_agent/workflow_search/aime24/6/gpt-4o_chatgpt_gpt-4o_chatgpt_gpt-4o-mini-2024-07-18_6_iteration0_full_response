Let the dimensions be x, y, and z. The surface area condition is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, which simplifies to xy + yz + zx = 27. The volume condition is xyz = 23. We need to find all positive real solutions (x, y, z) to these equations. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or substitution to find the solutions. By substituting z = 23/(xy) into the surface area equation, we get xy + 23/x + 23/y = 27. Solving this equation for positive x and y, we find the solutions (x, y, z) = (1, 23, 1), (23, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 23).

The sphere must have a diameter equal to or greater than this diagonal to fully enclose the box. From sub-task 2, we know the diagonal of each box is sqrt(531). Therefore, the radius of the sphere must be at least half of this diagonal, which is (1/2) * sqrt(531). The square of the radius, r^2, is then ((1/2) * sqrt(531))^2 = (1/4) * 531 = 531/4. The fraction 531/4 is already in simplest form, where 531 and 4 are relatively prime.
