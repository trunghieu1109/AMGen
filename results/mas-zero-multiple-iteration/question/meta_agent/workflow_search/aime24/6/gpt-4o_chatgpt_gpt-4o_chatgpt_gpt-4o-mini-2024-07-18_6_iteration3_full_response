Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables, and I will analyze each one to ensure they are declared before use. The parameters 'self' and 'taskInfo' are declared as function parameters. The variable 'sub_tasks' is declared at the beginning of the function as an empty list. The variable 'agents' is also declared at the beginning of the function as an empty list. The variable 'cot_instruction_1' is declared before it is used in the function call to 'LLMAgentBase'. The variables 'thinking1' and 'answer1' are declared as the return values of the function call to 'cot_agent_1'. The variable 'cot_sc_instruction_2' is declared before it is used in the function call to 'LLMAgentBase'. The variable 'N_2' is declared before it is used in the list comprehension to create 'cot_sc_agents_2'. The variables 'thinking_mapping_2', 'answer_mapping_2', and 'possible_answers_2' are declared before they are used in the loop. The loop variable 'i' is declared in the for loop. The variables 'thinking2' and 'answer2' are declared as the return values of the function call to 'cot_sc_agents_2[i]'. The variable 'cot_instruction_3' is declared before it is used in the function call to 'LLMAgentBase'. The variables 'thinking3' and 'answer3' are declared as the return values of the function call to 'cot_agent_3'. The variable 'max_round_4' is declared before it is used in the list comprehensions to create 'all_thinking_4' and 'all_answer_4'. The loop variable 'r' is declared in the for loop. The loop variable 'i' is declared in the nested for loop. The variable 'agent' is declared in the nested for loop. The variables 'thinking4' and 'answer4' are declared as the return values of the function call to 'agent'. The variable 'final_decision_agent_4' is declared before it is used in the function call to 'LLMAgentBase'. The variables 'thinking4' and 'answer4' are declared as the return values of the function call to 'final_decision_agent_4'. The variable 'final_answer' is declared as the return value of the function call to 'await self.make_final_answer'. The variable 'debate_instruction_4' is used in the function call to 'agent', but it is never declared within the scope of the function. This is an undeclared variable error.
