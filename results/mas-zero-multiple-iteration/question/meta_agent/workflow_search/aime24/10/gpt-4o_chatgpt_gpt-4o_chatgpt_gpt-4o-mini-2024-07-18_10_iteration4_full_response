Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables and function calls. Upon inspection, all variables used within the function are either declared as local variables, function parameters, or are part of the 'self' object, which is assumed to be correctly initialized elsewhere in the class. The loop variables 'i' and 'r' are declared within their respective loops. The variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the function but is not declared within the function's scope or passed as a parameter, which suggests it might be a class attribute or a global variable. However, without additional context, it is considered undeclared within the function's local scope.
