Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: 3
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables and function calls. Upon inspection, all variables used within the function are either declared within the function or are parameters of the function. The variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the function but is not declared within the function or passed as a parameter, which constitutes an undeclared variable error. All other variables, including loop variables and function call arguments, are properly declared.
