Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

Variables Checking: Upon analyzing the provided function, I found that the variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the function but is never declared or defined within the scope of the function. This occurs on lines where the 'debate_instruction' is passed as an argument to the 'agent' and 'final_decision_agent' calls. All other variables are either declared as function parameters, local variables, or are part of the class (e.g., 'self.node_model', 'self.max_sc', 'self.max_round', 'self.debate_role').
