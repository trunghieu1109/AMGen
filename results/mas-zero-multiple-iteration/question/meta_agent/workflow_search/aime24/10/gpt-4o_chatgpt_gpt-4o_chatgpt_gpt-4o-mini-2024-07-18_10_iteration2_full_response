Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: 2
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables. All variables used in the function are declared before use, including 'taskInfo', 'cot_instruction', 'cot_agent', 'thinking1', 'answer1', 'cot_sc_instruction', 'N', 'cot_agents', 'thinking_mapping', 'answer_mapping', 'possible_answers', 'answer2', 'thinking2', 'max_round', 'debate_agents', 'all_thinking', 'all_answer', 'final_decision_agent', 'thinking3', 'answer3', 'sub_tasks', and 'agents'. The variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the function but is never declared within the function's scope, leading to a potential error when it is used as an argument in function calls. This is the only undeclared variable in the function.
