Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: The problem involves two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with points D, E, C, and F being collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. The points A, D, H, and G lie on a circle, forming a cyclic quadrilateral. The side lengths given are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. Since BC and FG are parallel, and we have BC = 16 and FG = 17, the simplest interpretation is that the line segment CE, which lies along the line with D, E, C, and F, is the difference between FG and BC. Therefore, CE = FG - BC = 17 - 16 = 1. This deduction assumes that the geometry is straightforward and that the problem is designed to be solved by basic length subtraction, given the parallel nature of the rectangles and the collinearity of the points.
