Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: In the previous attempts, the main issue was the incorrect assumption about the placement of points B and D on the y-axis and the misunderstanding of the constraints imposed by the hyperbola and the rhombus. The hyperbola equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) allows us to parameterize points on the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions: \( (x, y) = (\sqrt{20} \cosh(t), \sqrt{24} \sinh(t)) \). For a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the points A, B, C, and D must be symmetric with respect to the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are along the x and y axes, so the points can be parameterized as \( A(\sqrt{20} \cosh(t), \sqrt{24} \sinh(t)) \), \( B(-\sqrt{20} \cosh(t), \sqrt{24} \sinh(t)) \), \( C(-\sqrt{20} \cosh(t), -\sqrt{24} \sinh(t)) \), and \( D(\sqrt{20} \cosh(t), -\sqrt{24} \sinh(t)) \). The length of diagonal BD is \( 2\sqrt{24} \sinh(t) \), and BD^2 is \( 4 \times 24 \times \sinh^2(t) \). The task is to find the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. Since \( \sinh(t) \) can take any real value, \( \sinh^2(t) \) can be arbitrarily large, but the constraint of the rhombus and the hyperbola limits the maximum value of BD^2. The correct approach is to find the maximum possible value of BD^2 given the constraints, which is a finite number. The maximum value of BD^2 occurs when the rhombus is inscribed in the hyperbola, and the greatest real number less than this maximum value is what we seek. The correct maximum value of BD^2 is 96, so the greatest real number less than this is 95.
