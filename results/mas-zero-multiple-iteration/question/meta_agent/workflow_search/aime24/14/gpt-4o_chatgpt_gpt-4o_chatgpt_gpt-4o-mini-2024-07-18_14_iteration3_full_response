Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: 3
Variables Checking: The function uses several variables, and most of them are declared before use. However, there is an undeclared variable 'max_bd_instruction' used in the call to 'cot_agent'. This variable is not defined anywhere in the function, leading to an error. All other variables, including loop variables and function parameters, are properly declared before use.
