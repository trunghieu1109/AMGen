Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: 2
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses the variable 'debate_instruction' without declaring it. This occurs in the loop where 'debate_agents' are used to generate 'thinking' and 'answer' pairs. The variable 'debate_instruction' is referenced as an argument in the agent call, but it is never declared or initialized within the function or passed as a parameter. This results in an undeclared variable error.
