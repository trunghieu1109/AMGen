Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent aGmY', content='To find the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b, we need to consider integers n in the range b <= n < b^2 that satisfy the condition a + c = sqrt(n), where n = ab + c and 0 <= a, c < b with a > 0. For each n in this range, we check if sqrt(n) is an integer and if it can be expressed as a + c with the given constraints. We start with b = 2 and increase b until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful integers. For b = 2, the range is 2 <= n < 4, and for b = 3, the range is 3 <= n < 9, and so on. We calculate the number of b-beautiful integers for each base and find that for b = 14, there are more than ten such integers.\n\nAnswer:14', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

This means n can be written as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b, with 0 <= a, c < b and a > 0 (since it must be a two-digit number). The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that the sum of these two digits, a + c, must equal the square root of n, i.e., a + c = sqrt(n). To verify if a number is b-beautiful, we need to check if it can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b and if the sum of its digits equals the square root of the number.; answer: A b-beautiful integer n is expressed in base b as a two-digit number, n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b. The sum of these digits, a + c, must equal the square root of n, i.e., a + c = sqrt(n).\nCoT-SC agent GAQz, on the purpose of exploring b-beautiful integers, thinking: For a number n to be b-beautiful, it must be expressible as a two-digit number in base b, i.e., n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b. This means 0 <= a, c < b and a > 0. Therefore, the smallest two-digit number in base b is when a = 1 and c = 0, which gives n = b. The largest two-digit number is when a = b - 1 and c = b - 1, which gives n = (b - 1)b + (b - 1) = b^2 - 1. Thus, the range of possible b-beautiful integers n is b <= n <= b^2 - 1.

The sum a + c must equal the square root of n. For n to be a two-digit number in base b, we have b <= n < b^2. Since n = ab + c, we have a + c = sqrt(n). To find the range of possible b-beautiful integers, we consider n = ab + c such that b <= n < b^2 and a + c = sqrt(n). The minimum value for n occurs when a = 1 and c = 0, giving n = b. The maximum value occurs when a = b - 1 and c = b - 1, giving n = (b - 1)b + (b - 1) = b^2 - 1.

The reasoning involves checking each base b starting from 2 and counting the number of b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n must satisfy the condition that it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of n. The range for n is b <= n < b^2, and we need to check if sqrt(n) is an integer and can be expressed as a + c where n = ab + c with 0 <= a, c < b and a > 0.
