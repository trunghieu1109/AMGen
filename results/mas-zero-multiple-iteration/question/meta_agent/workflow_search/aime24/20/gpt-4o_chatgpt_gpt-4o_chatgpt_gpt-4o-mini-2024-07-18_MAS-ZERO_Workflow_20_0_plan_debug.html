    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the properties from sub-task 1, calculate the range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent E3Kz:
For a b-beautiful integer n, it must be expressible as a two-digit number in base b. Such a number can be written as n = ab + c, where 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b and a &gt; 0. This implies that the smallest two-digit number in base b is b (when a = 1 and c = 0) and the largest is (b-1)b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 (when a = b-1 and c = b-1). Therefore, the range of possible b-beautiful integers n for a given base b is b &lt;= n &lt; b^2. Additionally, the condition a + c = sqrt(n) must be satisfied for n to be b-beautiful.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent E3Kz:
The range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b is b &lt;= n &lt; b^2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such integers. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such integers. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>To find the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b, we need to consider integers n in the range b &lt;= n &lt; b^2 that satisfy the condition a + c = sqrt(n), where n = ab + c and 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b with a &gt; 0. For each n in this range, we check if sqrt(n) is an integer and if it can be expressed as a + c with the given constraints. We start with b = 2 and increase b until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful integers. For b = 2, the range is 2 &lt;= n &lt; 4, and for b = 3, the range is 3 &lt;= n &lt; 9, and so on. We calculate the number of b-beautiful integers for each base and find that for b = 14, there are more than ten such integers.
