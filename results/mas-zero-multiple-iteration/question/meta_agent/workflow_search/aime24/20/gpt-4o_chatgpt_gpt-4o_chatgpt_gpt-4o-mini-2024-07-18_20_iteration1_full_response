Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' contains an undeclared variable 'cot_instruction_4' used in the call to 'cot_agent_4'. This variable is referenced on the line where 'cot_agent_4' is called, but it is never declared or assigned a value within the function. All other variables are declared before use, including 'taskInfo', 'thinking_1', 'answer_1', 'thinking_2', 'answer_2', 'thinking_3', and 'answer_3'.
