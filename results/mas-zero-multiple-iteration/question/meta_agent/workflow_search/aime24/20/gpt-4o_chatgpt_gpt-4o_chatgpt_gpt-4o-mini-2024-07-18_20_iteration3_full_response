Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: 3
Variables Checking: The function uses a variable 'cot_instruction_6' on line 66, which is undeclared. All other variables are declared before use, including function parameters, loop variables, and arguments passed to function calls. The 'cot_instruction_6' variable is used as an argument in the call to 'cot_agent_6', but it is never defined within the function scope.
