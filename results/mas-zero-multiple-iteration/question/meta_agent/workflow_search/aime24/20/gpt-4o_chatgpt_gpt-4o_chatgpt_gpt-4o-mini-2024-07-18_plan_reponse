Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "To find the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b, we need to consider integers n in the range b <= n < b^2 that satisfy the condition a + c = sqrt(n), where n = ab + c and 0 <= a, c < b with a > 0. For each n in this range, we check if sqrt(n) is an integer and if it can be expressed as a + c with the given constraints. We start with b = 2 and increase b until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful integers. For b = 2, the range is 2 <= n < 4, and for b = 3, the range is 3 <= n < 9, and so on. We calculate the number of b-beautiful integers for each base and find that for b = 14, there are more than ten such integers.\n\nAnswer:14",
