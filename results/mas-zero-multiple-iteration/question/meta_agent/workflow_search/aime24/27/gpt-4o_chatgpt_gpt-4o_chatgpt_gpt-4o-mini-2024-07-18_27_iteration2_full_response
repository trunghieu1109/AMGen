Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

Variables Checking: Upon reviewing the provided function, I identified an undeclared variable issue. The variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the loop for the debate agents in Sub-task 4, but it is never declared or initialized within the function or passed as a parameter. This results in a NameError when the code attempts to use 'debate_instruction'. All other variables are declared before use, including loop variables and function parameters.
