Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

Variables Checking: Upon reviewing the provided function, I identified several undeclared variables. The variable 'sum' is not declared before its use in the example provided, but this is not part of the function to analyze. In the function 'forward', the variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the loop for 'Sub-task 4' but is never declared within the function. This constitutes an undeclared variable error. All other variables, including 'taskInfo', 'thinking1', 'answer1', 'thinking2_1_1_1', 'answer2_1_1_1', 'thinking2_1_1_2', 'answer2_1_1_2', 'thinking2_2', 'answer2_2', 'thinking3', 'answer3', 'thinking4', and 'answer4', are either parameters, declared within the function, or are part of the 'self' object, which is assumed to be correctly initialized elsewhere in the class.
