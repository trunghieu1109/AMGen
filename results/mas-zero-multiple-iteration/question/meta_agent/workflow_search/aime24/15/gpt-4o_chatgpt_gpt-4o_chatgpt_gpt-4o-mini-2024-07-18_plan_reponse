In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "The problem involves determining the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know from the problem statement that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, the task is to find how many of these residents also own the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of these items, which are the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Since every resident also owns a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents are the ones who own all four items. Thus, the number of residents owning all four items is 234. The previous attempts and feedback confirm this calculation, as the residents owning all three of the specified items automatically own all four due to the universal ownership of candy hearts.\n\nAnswer:234",
