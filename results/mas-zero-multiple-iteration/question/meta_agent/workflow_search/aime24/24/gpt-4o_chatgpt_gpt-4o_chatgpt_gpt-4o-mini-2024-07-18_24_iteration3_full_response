Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' contains an undeclared variable 'cot_reflect_instruction' used in the call to 'cot_agent_refine'. This variable is not declared or defined anywhere in the function before its use. Additionally, the variable 'sum' is not used in this function, so there is no issue related to it. All other variables, including loop variables and function parameters, are properly declared before use.
