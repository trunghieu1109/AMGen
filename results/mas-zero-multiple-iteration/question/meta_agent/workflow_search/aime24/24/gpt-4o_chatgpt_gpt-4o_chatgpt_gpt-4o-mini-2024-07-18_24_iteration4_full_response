Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Variables Checking: Upon reviewing the provided function, I have identified an undeclared variable issue. The variable 'debate_instruction' is used in the function but is never declared or defined within the scope of the function. This occurs on the line where the debate agents are invoked with 'debate_instruction' as an argument. All other variables appear to be properly declared and used within their respective scopes.
