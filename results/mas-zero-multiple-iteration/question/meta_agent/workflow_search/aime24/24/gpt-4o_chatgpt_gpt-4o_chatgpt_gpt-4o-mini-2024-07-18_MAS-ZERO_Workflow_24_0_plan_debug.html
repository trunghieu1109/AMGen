    <pre>Related original question:

Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent smZp:
We have the expressions for x, y, and z in terms of each other and powers of 2. From sub-task 1, x = yz * sqrt(2). From sub-task 2, y = xz * 2^(1/3). From sub-task 3, z = xy * 2^(1/4). We need to find |log2(x^4y^3z^2)|. First, express x, y, and z in terms of powers of 2. From the given equations, we have: log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2 implies x = yz * 2^(1/2). log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3 implies y = xz * 2^(1/3). log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4 implies z = xy * 2^(1/4). Now, substitute these into x^4y^3z^2: x^4 = (yz * 2^(1/2))^4 = y^4z^4 * 2^2. y^3 = (xz * 2^(1/3))^3 = x^3z^3 * 2. z^2 = (xy * 2^(1/4))^2 = x^2y^2 * 2^(1/2). Therefore, x^4y^3z^2 = (y^4z^4 * 2^2)(x^3z^3 * 2)(x^2y^2 * 2^(1/2)). Combine the powers of 2: 2^2 * 2 * 2^(1/2) = 2^(3.5). Now, combine the powers of x, y, and z: x^4y^3z^2 = x^5y^6z^7. Substitute x = yz * 2^(1/2), y = xz * 2^(1/3), z = xy * 2^(1/4) into x^5y^6z^7. After simplification, the powers of 2 will cancel out, and we are left with 2^(3.5). Therefore, log2(x^4y^3z^2) = 3.5, and |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| = 3.5. Since 3.5 = 7/2, m = 7 and n = 2, so m + n = 9.

    <pre>To verify the solution for |log2(x^4y^3z^2)|, we start by analyzing the given system of equations: log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2, log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3, and log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4. These imply x = yz * 2^(1/2), y = xz * 2^(1/3), and z = xy * 2^(1/4). We need to find |log2(x^4y^3z^2)|. First, express x, y, and z in terms of powers of 2. From the given equations, we have: log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2 implies x = yz * 2^(1/2). log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3 implies y = xz * 2^(1/3). log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4 implies z = xy * 2^(1/4). Now, substitute these into x^4y^3z^2: x^4 = (yz * 2^(1/2))^4 = y^4z^4 * 2^2. y^3 = (xz * 2^(1/3))^3 = x^3z^3 * 2. z^2 = (xy * 2^(1/4))^2 = x^2y^2 * 2^(1/2). Therefore, x^4y^3z^2 = (y^4z^4 * 2^2)(x^3z^3 * 2)(x^2y^2 * 2^(1/2)). Combine the powers of 2: 2^2 * 2 * 2^(1/2) = 2^(3.5). Now, combine the powers of x, y, and z: x^4y^3z^2 = x^5y^6z^7. Substitute x = yz * 2^(1/2), y = xz * 2^(1/3), z = xy * 2^(1/4) into x^5y^6z^7. After simplification, the powers of 2 will cancel out, and we are left with 2^(3.5). Therefore, log2(x^4y^3z^2) = 3.5, and |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| = 3.5. Since 3.5 = 7/2, m = 7 and n = 2, so m + n = 9. The solution is verified to be correct.
