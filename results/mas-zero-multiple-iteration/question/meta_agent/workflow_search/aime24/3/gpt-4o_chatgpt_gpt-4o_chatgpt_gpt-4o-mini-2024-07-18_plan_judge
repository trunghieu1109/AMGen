Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: We are given two functions: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). From the analysis, we know that y is periodic with period 1 and ranges from 0 to 1, while x is periodic with period 1/3 and also ranges from 0 to 1. For the graphs to intersect, we need y = x. This means we need 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), which simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). The function g is V-shaped with a minimum at 1/4, and both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) range from 0 to 1/2. The function g will be 0 when its argument is 1/4, and it will be 1/4 when its argument is 0 or 1/2. Therefore, the equation g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))) can be satisfied in several ways: both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are 1/4, or both are 0, or both are 1/2. However, due to the periodicity and the nature of the oscillations, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy these conditions within their respective periods. Considering the periodicity, we find that there are 6 intersection points over one period of the functions, as the intersections repeat every 1/3 period of x and every period of y.
