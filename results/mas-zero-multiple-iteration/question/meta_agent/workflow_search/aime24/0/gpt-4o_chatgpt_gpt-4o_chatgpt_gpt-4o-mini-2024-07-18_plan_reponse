        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

        "response": "From Sub-task 1, we know Aya's walking speed s is 3 km/h. From Sub-task 2, we know the time spent in the coffee shop t is 36 minutes. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 km at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 3 + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h. The walking time is the distance divided by the speed, so the walking time is 9 / 3.5 hours. Converting this to minutes, we have (9 / 3.5) * 60 minutes. The total time including the coffee shop is this walking time plus the 36 minutes spent in the coffee shop. Therefore, the total time is (9 / 3.5) * 60 + 36 minutes. Calculating this gives (9 / 3.5) * 60 = 154.2857 minutes, and adding 36 minutes gives 190.2857 minutes. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total time is 190 minutes.\n\nAnswer:190",
