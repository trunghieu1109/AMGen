Variables Checking: Upon analyzing the provided function, I found that the variable 'debate_instruction' is used but never declared within the function's scope. It is referenced in the loop where debate agents are used, but there is no prior assignment or parameter declaration for 'debate_instruction'. All other variables appear to be declared before use, including loop variables and function parameters.
