Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables and parameters. The parameters 'self' and 'taskInfo' are declared as part of the function signature. The variable 'cot_instruction_1_1' is declared before use. The variable 'cot_agent_1_1' is declared before use. The variables 'thinking1_1' and 'answer1_1' are declared and initialized by the call to 'cot_agent_1_1'. The variable 'N' is declared and initialized from 'self.max_sc'. The list 'cot_agents_1_2' is initialized with 'N' elements, and each element is an instance of 'LLMAgentBase'. The variables 'thinking_mapping_1_2', 'answer_mapping_1_2', and 'possible_answers_1_2' are declared before use. The loop variable 'i' in the loop 'for i in range(N)' is declared as part of the loop construct. The variables 'thinking1_2' and 'answer1_2' are declared and initialized by the call to 'cot_agents_1_2[i]'. The variable 'final_answer1_2' is declared and initialized by the call to 'Counter(possible_answers_1_2).most_common(1)[0][0]'. The variable 'max_round' is declared and initialized from 'self.max_round'. The list 'debate_agents_1_3' is initialized with elements based on 'self.debate_role'. The loop variable 'r' in the loop 'for r in range(max_round)' is declared as part of the loop construct. The loop variable 'i' in the loop 'for i in range(len(debate_agents_1_3))' is declared as part of the loop construct. The variables 'all_thinking_1_3' and 'all_answer_1_3' are declared and initialized as lists of lists. The variables 'thinking1_3' and 'answer1_3' are declared and initialized by the call to 'debate_agents_1_3[i]'. The variable 'final_decision_agent_1_3' is declared and initialized as an instance of 'LLMAgentBase'. The variables 'thinking1_3' and 'answer1_3' are redeclared and reinitialized by the call to 'final_decision_agent_1_3'. The variable 'final_answer' is declared and initialized by the call to 'await self.make_final_answer'. However, the variable 'debate_instruction_1_3' is used but never declared within the function, leading to an undeclared variable error.
