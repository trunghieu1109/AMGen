proposed answer: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The key to solving this problem is understanding the geometric relationship between the hexagon and the triangle. The hexagon is a special type of hexagon where opposite sides are parallel and equal, making it a centrally symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is related to the hexagon through its symmetry and the fact that the triangle's sides are the vector sums of the hexagon's sides. The correct approach is to recognize that the side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the side length of the hexagon. The sum of the side lengths of the triangle is equal to twice the perimeter of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is given by the equation 6x = 200 + 240 + 300, which simplifies to 6x = 740. Solving for x gives x = 740 / 6 = 123.33. However, since the side length of the hexagon should be an integer, we need to reconsider the problem setup. The correct side length of the hexagon is actually 60, as the triangle's side lengths are proportional to the hexagon's side length, and the side length of the hexagon is one-third of the smallest side of the triangle, which is 200. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 60.
