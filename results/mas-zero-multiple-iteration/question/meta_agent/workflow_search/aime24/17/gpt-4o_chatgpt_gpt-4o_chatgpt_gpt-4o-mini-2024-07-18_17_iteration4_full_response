Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent exR1', content='In sub-task 2, we explored specific cases where two of the variables are equal, such as a = b, a = c, or b = c. This simplification reduces the number of variables and can help identify patterns or specific solutions that satisfy both the sum a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial equation. By substituting these conditions into the polynomial equation, we derived simpler forms: for a = b, the equation becomes 2a^2c + 2c^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000; for a = c, it becomes 2a^2b + 2b^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000; and for b = c, it becomes 2b^2a + 2a^2b + 2b^3 = 6,000,000. Additionally, using the condition a + b + c = 300, we can express one variable in terms of the others, such as c = 300 - a - b. By solving these simplified equations, we can identify specific triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both conditions. For example, if we find a solution for a = b, we can check if it satisfies the sum condition and the polynomial equation. This process helps filter out triples that do not meet the criteria and focus on those that do. The approach of using symmetry and simplifying the problem by considering cases where two variables are equal is a valid method to reduce the complexity of the problem.

This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the stars and bars method. The number of solutions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the sum (300 in this case) and k is the number of variables (3 here: a, b, and c). Therefore, the number of solutions is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2).
