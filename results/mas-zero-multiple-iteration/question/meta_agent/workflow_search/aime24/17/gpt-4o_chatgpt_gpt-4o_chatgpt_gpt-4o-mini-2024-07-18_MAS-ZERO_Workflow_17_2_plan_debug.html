\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, explore specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c to simplify the polynomial equation. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent oWoo:
To explore specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c, we can substitute these conditions into the polynomial equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 and see if it simplifies the problem. For instance, if we assume a = b, then the equation becomes 2a^2c + 2c^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. Similarly, if a = c, the equation becomes 2a^2b + 2b^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. If b = c, the equation becomes 2b^2a + 2a^2b + 2b^3 = 6,000,000. These substitutions reduce the number of variables and can potentially make it easier to find solutions. Additionally, since a + b + c = 300, we can further substitute c = 300 - a - b into these equations to reduce the number of variables further. By exploring these cases, we can identify if there are any symmetric or special solutions that satisfy both the sum and the polynomial equation.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent oWoo:
To explore specific cases, consider a = b, a = c, or b = c and substitute into the polynomial equation to simplify it. For example, if a = b, the equation becomes 2a^2c + 2c^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. Similarly, if a = c, the equation becomes 2a^2b + 2b^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. If b = c, the equation becomes 2b^2a + 2a^2b + 2b^3 = 6,000,000. These substitutions reduce the number of variables and can help find solutions.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, filter the triples using identified patterns. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Q4PX (yourself):
In sub-task 2, we explored specific cases where two of the variables are equal, such as a = b, a = c, or b = c. This led to simplified equations: 2a^2c + 2c^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000 for a = b, 2a^2b + 2b^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000 for a = c, and 2b^2a + 2a^2b + 2b^3 = 6,000,000 for b = c. These equations reduce the number of variables, making it easier to find solutions. We also have the constraint a + b + c = 300, which can be used to express one variable in terms of the others, further simplifying the problem. By solving these simplified equations, we can identify specific triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both the sum and the polynomial equation. For example, if we solve the equation for a = b, we can find specific values of a and c that satisfy both conditions. Similarly, we can solve for the other cases. This filtering process helps us identify potential solutions by reducing the complexity of the problem.
