Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iKS9', content='To solve sub-task 2, we need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The first step is to generate all possible triples (a, b, c) where a, b, and c are nonnegative integers and a + b + c = 300.

Since a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, we can use a combinatorial approach to count the number of solutions. This is a classic stars and bars problem, where we have 300 \'stars\' to distribute among 3 \'bins\' (a, b, and c). The number of ways to do this is given by the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the total sum (300) and k is the number of variables (3). Therefore, the number of solutions is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2).\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent TkPi:\n45551\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent iKS9 (yourself):\nTo solve sub-task 2, we need to filter the triples (a, b, c) generated in sub-task 1 such that they satisfy the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
