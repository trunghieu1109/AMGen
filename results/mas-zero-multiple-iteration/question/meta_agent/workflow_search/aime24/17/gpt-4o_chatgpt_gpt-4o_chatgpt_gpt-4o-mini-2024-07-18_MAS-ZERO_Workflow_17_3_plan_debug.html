Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, explore specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c to simplify the polynomial equation. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent j6vs:
To explore specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c, we can substitute these conditions into the polynomial equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 and see if it simplifies the problem. For instance, if we assume a = b, then the equation becomes 2a^2c + 2c^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. Similarly, if a = c, the equation becomes 2a^2b + 2b^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. If b = c, the equation becomes 2b^2a + 2a^2b + 2b^3 = 6,000,000. These substitutions reduce the number of variables and can potentially make it easier to find solutions. Additionally, since a + b + c = 300, we can express one variable in terms of the others, such as c = 300 - a - b, and substitute this into the simplified equations to further reduce the complexity. By exploring these cases, we might find specific solutions or patterns that satisfy both the sum and the polynomial equation.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent j6vs:
By exploring specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c, we can simplify the polynomial equation and potentially find solutions that satisfy both the sum a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. This approach reduces the number of variables and can reveal specific solutions or patterns.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, filter the triples using identified patterns. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent T3B9 (yourself):
In sub-task 2, we explored specific cases where two of the variables are equal, such as a = b, a = c, or b = c. This led to simplified equations: 2a^2c + 2c^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000 for a = b, 2a^2b + 2b^2a + 2a^3 = 6,000,000 for a = c, and 2b^2a + 2a^2b + 2b^3 = 6,000,000 for b = c. Additionally, we have the constraint a + b + c = 300. By substituting these conditions, we can reduce the number of variables and solve for specific values of a, b, and c. For example, if a = b, then c = 300 - 2a, and we can substitute this into the simplified equation to find possible values of a. Similarly, for a = c, we have b = 300 - 2a, and for b = c, we have a = 300 - 2b. Solving these equations will give us specific triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both the sum and the polynomial equation. We can then filter these triples to find the ones that are valid solutions.

Filter the triples by solving the simplified equations for specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c, and checking which triples satisfy both the sum a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
