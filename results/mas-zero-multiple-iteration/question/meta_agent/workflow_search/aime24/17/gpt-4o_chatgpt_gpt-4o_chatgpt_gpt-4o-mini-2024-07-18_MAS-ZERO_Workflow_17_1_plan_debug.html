Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, evaluate the structure of the equation to identify patterns or simplifications. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SEDw:
The equation given is a symmetric polynomial in a, b, and c: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. This equation can be rewritten as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c into the equation. This gives us a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This form shows that the equation is symmetric and depends on the values of a, b, and c in a similar way. The symmetry suggests that if (a, b, c) is a solution, then any permutation of (a, b, c) is also a solution. This can help reduce the number of cases to check when finding solutions. Additionally, the equation is quadratic in each variable, which might allow for further simplifications or insights when solving for specific values of a, b, and c.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent SEDw:
The equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, and can be rewritten using the condition a + b + c = 300 to simplify the problem. This symmetry can help identify patterns and reduce the number of cases to check.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, filter the triples using identified patterns. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent z2gp (yourself):
From sub-task 2, we identified that the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 can be rewritten as a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000 using the condition a + b + c = 300. This form shows that the equation is symmetric in a, b, and c. This symmetry implies that if (a, b, c) is a solution, then any permutation of (a, b, c) is also a solution. To filter the triples, we can assume without loss of generality that a &lt;= b &lt;= c, which reduces the number of cases to check. Additionally, since the equation is quadratic in each variable, we can analyze the behavior of the equation as a, b, and c vary, and use the symmetry to further reduce the search space. For example, if a is very small, then b and c must be large to satisfy a + b + c = 300, and vice versa. We can also use the fact that the equation is symmetric to test only one representative from each equivalence class of permutations, further reducing the number of triples to check.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent z2gp (yourself):
To filter the triples, assume without loss of generality that a &lt;= b &lt;= c, and use the symmetry of the equation to reduce the number of cases to check. This allows us to focus on one representative from each equivalence class of permutations, significantly reducing the search space.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, filter the triples to satisfy the equation. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent eCSR:
The approach to filter the triples by assuming a &lt;= b &lt;= c and using the symmetry of the equation is a valid strategy. This reduces the number of cases to check significantly, as we only need to consider one representative from each equivalence class of permutations. By focusing on the condition a + b + c = 300 and the symmetry in the equation, we can systematically test possible values for a, b, and c, starting with small values for a and increasing, while ensuring b and c are larger or equal to a. This method leverages the symmetry and constraints effectively to find the solutions.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, filter the triples using identified patterns. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent z2gp (yourself):
To filter the triples, we can use the symmetry of the equation and the condition a + b + c = 300. By assuming without loss of generality that a &lt;= b &lt;= c, we reduce the number of cases to check. This is because the equation is symmetric, meaning if (a, b, c) is a solution, then any permutation of (a, b, c) is also a solution. By focusing on one representative from each equivalence class of permutations, we significantly reduce the search space. We can start by fixing a and then determine possible values for b and c such that a &lt;= b &lt;= c and a + b + c = 300. We can then check if these values satisfy the equation a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This method leverages the symmetry and constraints effectively to find the solutions.
