The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "The output of sub-task 4 already provides the inradius of triangle ABC as a fraction in simplest form: 8092/2023. It states that the greatest common divisor of 8092 and 2023 is 1, confirming that the fraction is in simplest form. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 8092 + 2023 = 10115.\n\nAnswer:10115",
