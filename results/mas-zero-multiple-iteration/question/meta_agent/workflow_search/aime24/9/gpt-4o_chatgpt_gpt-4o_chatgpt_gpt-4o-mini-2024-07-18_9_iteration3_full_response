Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: 3
Variables Checking: The function uses a variable 'cot_instruction_6_3' on line 153, which is undeclared. This variable is used as an argument in a function call to 'cot_agent', but it is never defined or assigned a value within the function. All other variables are declared before use, including loop variables and function parameters.
