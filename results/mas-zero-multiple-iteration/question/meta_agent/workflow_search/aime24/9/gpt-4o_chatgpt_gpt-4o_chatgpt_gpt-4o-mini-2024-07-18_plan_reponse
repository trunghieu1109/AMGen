        "problem": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "The initial calculation of the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize was 42/2645. However, it was incorrectly stated that 42 and 2645 are relatively prime. Upon reviewing, it was found that both numbers are divisible by 7. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 7 gives the simplified fraction 6/377. Therefore, the correct values are m = 6 and n = 377. To find m+n, we add these two numbers together: 6 + 377 = 383. This correction ensures that the fraction is in its simplest form, and the calculation is now accurate.\n\nAnswer:383",
