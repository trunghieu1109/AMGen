        "response": "Both agents agree on the form of the expression 324cos(\u03b8) - 432sin(\u03b8) and the method to maximize it by expressing it as Rcos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) or Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). The amplitude R is correctly calculated as 540. The disagreement is in the sign of the angle \u03c6. Agent 3HUg uses \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3), while Agent ICQn uses \u03c6 = -atan(-432/324). These are actually equivalent because arctan(-4/3) = -atan(4/3) = -atan(-432/324). Therefore, both agents are correct, and the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the real part is \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3).\n\nAnswer:\u03b8 = arctan(-4/3)",
