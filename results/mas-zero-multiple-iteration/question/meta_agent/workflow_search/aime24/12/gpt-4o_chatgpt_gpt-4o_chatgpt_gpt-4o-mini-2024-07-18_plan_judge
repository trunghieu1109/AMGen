proposed answer: Both agents agree on the form of the expression 324cos(θ) - 432sin(θ) and the method to maximize it by expressing it as Rcos(θ - φ) or Rcos(θ + φ). The amplitude R is correctly calculated as 540. The disagreement is in the sign of the angle φ. Agent 3HUg uses φ = arctan(-4/3), while Agent ICQn uses φ = -atan(-432/324). These are actually equivalent because arctan(-4/3) = -atan(4/3) = -atan(-432/324). Therefore, both agents are correct, and the value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = arctan(-4/3).

Answer:θ = arctan(-4/3)
Extracted answer: θ = arctan(-4/3)
Correct answer: 540
