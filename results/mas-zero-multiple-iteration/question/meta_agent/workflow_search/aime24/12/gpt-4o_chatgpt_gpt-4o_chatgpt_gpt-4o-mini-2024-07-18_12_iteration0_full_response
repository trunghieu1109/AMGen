This can be rewritten in the form Rcos(θ - φ), which is a standard way to express a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. Here, R is the amplitude of the cosine function and φ is the phase shift. To find R, we use the formula R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where a = 324 and b = -432. Calculating this, R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. The angle φ can be determined using tan(φ) = b/a = -432/324 = -4/3, giving φ = arctan(-4/3). The maximum value of the expression Rcos(θ - φ) is R, which occurs when θ - φ = 0. Therefore, the value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = φ = arctan(-4/3).

To maximize this expression, we can express it in the form Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as sqrt((324)^2 + (-432)^2), which equals 540. The angle φ is found using tan(φ) = -432/324, giving φ = atan(-432/324). The expression Rcos(θ + φ) is maximized when θ + φ = 0, leading to θ = -φ.

Since |z| = 4, we have r = 4. Therefore, z can be expressed as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is a real parameter representing the angle in radians.; answer: z = 4e^{iθ}\nCoT agent COW8, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We have the complex number z = 4e^{iθ} from sub-task 1. We need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z and simplify to find the real part as a function of θ. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}). This simplifies to (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + (24e^{-iθ} + 36ie^{-iθ}). We can combine these terms: 300e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} + 36ie^{-iθ}. Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) and e^{-iθ} = cos(θ) - i sin(θ), we substitute these into the expression. The real part is: 300cos(θ) + 24cos(θ) = 324cos(θ). Therefore, the real part of the expression as a function of θ is 324cos(θ).; answer: 324cos(θ)\nCritic agent JVgr, on reviewing simplification, feedback: The answer provided by Chain-of-Thought Agent COW8 is incorrect. The error lies in the simplification of the expression and the calculation of the real part. When substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, we have: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}). This becomes (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + (24e^{-iθ} + 36ie^{-iθ}). The real part of this expression is not simply 324cos(θ). We need to consider the real parts of each term separately. The real part of 300e^{iθ} is 300cos(θ), and the real part of 24e^{-iθ} is 24cos(θ). Therefore, the correct real part of the entire expression is 300cos(θ) + 24cos(θ) = 324cos(θ). However, the imaginary parts should not have been ignored, as they contribute to the overall expression. The correct approach is to combine the real and imaginary parts properly and then extract the real part of the entire expression. The correct real part should be 324cos(θ) + 432sin(θ).; correct: False\nCoT agent COW8, on refining simplification, thinking: To solve this problem, we start by substituting the parametric form of z, which is z = 4e^{iθ}, into the given expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z.

This is a linear combination of cosine and sine functions, which can be written in the form Rcos(θ - φ) where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. To find R, we use the formula R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where a = 324 and b = -432. Calculating this, R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. The angle φ can be found using tan(φ) = b/a = -432/324 = -4/3. Thus, φ = arctan(-4/3). The maximum value of Rcos(θ - φ) is R, which occurs when θ - φ = 0, i.e., θ = φ.

This can be rewritten in the form Rcos(θ + φ) where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The amplitude R is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients of cos(θ) and sin(θ), which is R = sqrt((324)^2 + (-432)^2). Calculating this gives R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. The angle φ can be found using the tangent function, where tan(φ) = -432/324. Solving this gives φ = atan(-432/324). To maximize the expression Rcos(θ + φ), we set θ + φ = 0, which implies θ = -φ.
