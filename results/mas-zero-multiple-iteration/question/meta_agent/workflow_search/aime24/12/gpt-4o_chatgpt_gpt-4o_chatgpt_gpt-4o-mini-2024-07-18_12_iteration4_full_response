Iteration: 4
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses a variable 'cot_instruction_3b2b2' on line 88, which is undeclared. All other variables are declared before use, including function parameters, local variables, and arguments passed to function calls. The 'cot_instruction_3b2b2' variable is referenced in the call to 'cot_agent_3b2b2' but is never declared within the function scope.
