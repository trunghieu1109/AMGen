    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, sum m, n, and p to get the final answer. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent edt0:
In sub-task 3, we derived that the distance from the point to the faces of the tetrahedron can be expressed as \( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4} \), which gives us the values \( m = 3 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 4 \). These values satisfy the conditions that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the sum \( m + n + p = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 \). This sum is the final answer for sub-task 4, as it is the result of combining the outputs from the previous sub-tasks.

### thinking by Debate Agent q6t0:
In sub-task 3, the distance from the point to the faces of the tetrahedron was determined to be expressed as \( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4} \). This indicates that \( m = 3 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 4 \). According to the problem, we need to find the sum of these integers. Therefore, we calculate \( m + n + p = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 \). This sum is consistent with the problem&#39;s requirements, ensuring that \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are positive integers with \( m \) and \( p \) being relatively prime, and \( n \) not divisible by the square of any prime. Hence, the final answer is 9.

### answer by Debate Agent edt0:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, sum m, n, and p to get the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, sum m, n, and p to get the final answer. and explaination.</pre>
