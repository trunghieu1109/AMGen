        "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "In sub-task 3, the distance from the point to the faces of the tetrahedron was determined to be expressed as \\( \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\). This indicates that \\( m = 3 \\), \\( n = 2 \\), and \\( p = 4 \\). According to the problem, we need to find the sum of these integers. Therefore, we calculate \\( m + n + p = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 \\). This sum is consistent with the problem's requirements, ensuring that \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( p \\) are positive integers with \\( m \\) and \\( p \\) being relatively prime, and \\( n \\) not divisible by the square of any prime. Hence, the final answer is 9.\n\nAnswer:9",
