Iteration: 3
Variables Checking: The function uses several variables that are not declared before use. Specifically, 'cot_initial_instruction' is used in the call to 'cot_agent' but is never declared within the function. Additionally, 'sum' is not used in this function, so there is no undeclared use of 'sum'. All other variables, including 'taskInfo', 'thinking1', 'answer1', 'thinking2', 'answer2', 'thinking3', 'answer3', 'feedback', 'correct', 'N', 'N_max', 'cot_inputs', 'cot_instruction', 'cot_sc_instruction', 'cot_reflect_instruction', and 'critic_instruction', are either parameters, declared within the function, or are attributes of 'self'.
