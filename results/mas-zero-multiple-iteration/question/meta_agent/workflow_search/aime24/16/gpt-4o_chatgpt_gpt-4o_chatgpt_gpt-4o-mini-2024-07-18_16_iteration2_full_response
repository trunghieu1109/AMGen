Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: 2
Variables Checking: The function uses several variables and function calls. Upon inspection, the variable 'cot_initial_instruction' is used in the call to 'cot_agent' on line 43, but it is never declared or initialized within the function or passed as a parameter. This results in an undeclared variable error. All other variables, including 'taskInfo', 'thinking1', 'answer1', 'thinking2', 'answer2', 'thinking3', 'answer3', 'feedback', 'correct', 'N', 'N_max', 'cot_inputs', 'sub_tasks', and 'agents', are either declared within the function, passed as parameters, or are part of the class instance (e.g., 'self.node_model', 'self.max_sc', 'self.max_round').
