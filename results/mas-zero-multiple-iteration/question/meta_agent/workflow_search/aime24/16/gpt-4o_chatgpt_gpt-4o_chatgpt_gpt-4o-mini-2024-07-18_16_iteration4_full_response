Iteration: 4
Variables Checking: The function uses several variables that are not declared within its scope. Specifically, 'cot_initial_instruction' is used in the call to 'cot_agent' but is never declared or initialized within the function. This will lead to a NameError when the function is executed. All other variables appear to be declared or passed as parameters correctly.
