To solve these equations, we can express y in terms of x or vice versa. From the first equation, y^x = x^{10}, we can take the x-th root to get y = x^{10/x}. From the second equation, x^{4y} = y^{10}, we can express x in terms of y by taking the 4y-th root to get x = y^{10/(4y)}. Now, substitute y = x^{10/x} into the second equation: x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10}. Simplifying, we get x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x}. Equating the exponents, 4x^{10/x} = 100/x. Solving for x, we find x = 10. Substituting x = 10 into y = x^{10/x}, we get y = 10^{10/10} = 10. Therefore, x = 10 and y = 10.
