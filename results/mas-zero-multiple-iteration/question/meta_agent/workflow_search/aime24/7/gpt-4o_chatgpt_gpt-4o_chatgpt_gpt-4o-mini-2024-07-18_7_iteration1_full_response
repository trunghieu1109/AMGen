To express y in terms of x, we can take the x-th root of both sides. This gives us y = (x^{10})^{1/x}. Simplifying this expression, we have y = x^{10/x}. Therefore, y is expressed in terms of x as y = x^{10/x}.; answer: y = x^{10/x}\nCoT agent TUuo, on the purpose of solving for x, thinking: We have the expression for y in terms of x from sub-task 2: y = x^{10/x}. We need to substitute this into the equation x^{4y} = y^{10}. Substituting y = x^{10/x} into the equation, we get x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10}. Simplifying the right side, we have (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{100/x}. The left side becomes x^{4x^{10/x}}. So the equation is x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x}. Since the bases are the same, we equate the exponents: 4x^{10/x} = 100/x. Solving for x, we multiply both sides by x to get 4x^{1 + 10/x} = 100. Let u = x^{10/x}, then x^{1 + 10/x} = x * u = x * x^{10/x} = x^{1 + 10/x} = x * u. So 4u = 100, giving u = 25. Since u = x^{10/x}, we have x^{10/x} = 25. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get (10/x)ln(x) = ln(25). Solving for x, we find x = 10.
