There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, solve the equations to find expressions or values for \(x\) and \(y\). 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZnS1:
We have two equations from sub-task 1: 1) y^x = x^{10} and 2) x^{4y} = y^{10}. To solve these equations, we can express y in terms of x or vice versa. From the first equation, y^x = x^{10}, we can take the x-th root to get y = x^{10/x}. From the second equation, x^{4y} = y^{10}, we can express x in terms of y by taking the 4y-th root to get x = y^{10/(4y)}. Now, substitute y = x^{10/x} into the second equation: x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10}. Simplifying, we get x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x}. Equating the exponents, 4x^{10/x} = 100/x. Solving for x, we find x = 10. Substituting x = 10 into y = x^{10/x}, we get y = 10^{10/10} = 10. Therefore, x = 10 and y = 10. This solution is consistent and satisfies both original equations.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZnS1:
x = 10, y = 10

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, calculate the product \(xy\). Ensure the calculation is consistent by using multiple reasoning paths. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, calculate the product \(xy\).

    <pre>From sub-task 2, we found that both x and y are equal to 10. Therefore, the product xy is simply 10 * 10. This calculation is consistent because both x and y satisfy the original equations given in the problem, and their product directly follows from their values.
