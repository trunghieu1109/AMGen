To express y in terms of x, we can take the x-th root of both sides. This gives us y = (x^10)^(1/x). Simplifying this expression, we have y = x^(10/x). Therefore, y is expressed in terms of x as y = x^(10/x).; answer: y = x^{10/x}\nCoT agent w5de, on the purpose of simplifying the equation, thinking: We have the expression for y in terms of x from sub-task 2: y = x^{10/x}. We need to substitute this expression into the equation x^{4y} = y^{10}. First, substitute y = x^{10/x} into the equation. This gives us x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10}. Now, simplify both sides. The left side becomes x^{4x^{10/x}}. The right side becomes (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{(10/x) * 10} = x^{100/x}. So the equation simplifies to x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x}.

To approximate the solution for x, we can use numerical methods. One suitable method is the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative root-finding algorithm. This method is appropriate because it is efficient for finding roots of real-valued functions and can converge quickly if a good initial guess is provided. The Newton-Raphson method requires the function and its derivative, and iteratively refines the estimate of the root.
