Substituting x = 10 into this expression gives y = 10^{10/10} = 10^1 = 10. Therefore, y = 10. This is consistent with the solution provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent TUuo, which confirms that the value of y is indeed 10 when x is 10.\n\nAnswer:10",

With this value of x, we can solve the equation y = x^(10/y) iteratively. Start with an initial guess for y, substitute it into the right side of the equation, and compute a new value for y. Repeat this process until the value of y converges to a stable value. This iterative method will give us the value of y that satisfies the equation given the solved value of x.\n\nAnswer:Use the expression y = x^(10/y) with the value of x from sub-task 3.2.2 and solve iteratively to find y.",
