    <pre>Related original question:

There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, use the solved value of \(x\) to find \(y\) using the expression from sub-task 2. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent TUuo:
From sub-task 3, we found that x = 10. In sub-task 2, we derived the expression for y in terms of x as y = x^{10/x}. Now that we know x = 10, we can substitute this value into the expression for y. So, y = 10^{10/10} = 10^1 = 10. Therefore, y = 10.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent TUuo:
10

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, use the solved value of \(x\) to find \(y\) using the expression from sub-task 2. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, use the solved value of \(x\) to find \(y\) using the expression from sub-task 2. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>In sub-task 3, we found that x = 10. According to the expression derived in sub-task 2, y is expressed in terms of x as y = x^{10/x}. Substituting x = 10 into this expression gives y = 10^{10/10} = 10^1 = 10. Therefore, y = 10. This is consistent with the solution provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent TUuo, which confirms that the value of y is indeed 10 when x is 10.
