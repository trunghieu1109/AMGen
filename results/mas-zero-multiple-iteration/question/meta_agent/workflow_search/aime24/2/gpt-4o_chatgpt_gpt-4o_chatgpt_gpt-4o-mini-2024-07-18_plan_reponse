Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 16, we obtain the simplified fraction 1/16. In this simplified fraction, the numerator (1) and the denominator (16) are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, m = 1 and n = 16. The sum m+n is 1+16 = 17. This confirms that the simplification is correct and m and n are relatively prime.\n\nAnswer:17",

        "response": "In Sub-task 3, the probability that a valid rotation exists was calculated as 35/256. To ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, we need to check if 35 and 256 have any common factors other than 1. The number 35 is the product of the primes 5 and 7, and 256 is a power of 2 (2^8). Since they have no common factors, the fraction is already simplified. Therefore, m = 35 and n = 256 are relatively prime. The problem asks for m + n, which is 35 + 256 = 291. Thus, the answer is correct.\n\nAnswer:291",

Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2 gives us 35/128. We need to ensure that the simplified fraction is in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime. Since 35 and 128 have no common factors other than 1, they are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 35 and n = 128, and m+n = 35 + 128 = 163.\n\nAnswer:163",
