Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
Iteration: 3
Variables Checking: Upon reviewing the function, I identified an undeclared variable 'debate_instruction' used in the loop for debate agents. This variable is referenced in the function calls to the debate agents but is never declared or initialized within the function or passed as a parameter. All other variables appear to be declared or passed as parameters before use.
