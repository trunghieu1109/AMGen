Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: Both agents agree on the method to count the rectangles. They identify that to form a rectangle within the dodecagon, we need two pairs of parallel lines: one pair of parallel sides and one pair of parallel diagonals. From the previous sub-task, it was determined that there are 6 pairs of parallel sides and 27 pairs of parallel diagonals. By selecting one pair of parallel sides and one pair of parallel diagonals, we can form a rectangle. The total number of rectangles is the product of the number of pairs of parallel sides and the number of pairs of parallel diagonals, which is 6 * 27. Both agents calculated this product to be 162, and they both agree on this result. Therefore, the final count of rectangles is 162.
