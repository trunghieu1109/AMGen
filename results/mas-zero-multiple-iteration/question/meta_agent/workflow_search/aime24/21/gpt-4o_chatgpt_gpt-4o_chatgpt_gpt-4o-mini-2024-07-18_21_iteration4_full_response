Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Iteration: 4
Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables, and I will analyze each one to ensure they are declared before use. The parameters 'self' and 'taskInfo' are declared as function parameters. The variable 'sub_tasks' is declared on line 3, 'agents' on line 4, 'cot_instruction' on line 7, 'cot_agent' on line 8, 'thinking1' and 'answer1' on line 9, 'cot_sc_instruction' on line 13, 'N' on line 14, 'cot_agents' on line 15, 'thinking_mapping' and 'answer_mapping' on line 16, 'possible_answers' on line 17, 'i' is declared as a loop variable on line 18, 'answer2' on line 24, 'thinking2' on line 25, 'cot_instruction_3' on line 28, 'cot_agent_3' on line 29, 'thinking3' and 'answer3' on line 30, 'debate_agents' on line 34, 'max_round' on line 35, 'all_thinking' and 'all_answer' on line 36, 'r' is declared as a loop variable on line 37, 't' and 'a' on line 40, 'input_infos' on line 42, 'final_decision_agent' on line 47, 'thinking4' and 'answer4' on line 48, and 'final_answer' on line 54. The variable 'debate_instruction' is used on lines 40 and 43 but is never declared within the function, leading to an undeclared variable error. All other variables are declared before use.
