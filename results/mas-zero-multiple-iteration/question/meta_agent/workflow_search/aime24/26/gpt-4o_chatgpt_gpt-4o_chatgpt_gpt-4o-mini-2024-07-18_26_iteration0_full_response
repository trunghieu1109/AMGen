For each element a in A, the number of sets B that have maximum element a is 2^(a-1), because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to be in B along with a.

We need this sum to equal 2024. We can express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. The binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^3.
