Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: 4
Variables Checking: The variable 'cot_sum_instruction' is used in the function call on line 54 but is never declared within the function. This results in an undeclared variable error. All other variables are declared before use, including function parameters, loop variables, and list comprehension variables.
