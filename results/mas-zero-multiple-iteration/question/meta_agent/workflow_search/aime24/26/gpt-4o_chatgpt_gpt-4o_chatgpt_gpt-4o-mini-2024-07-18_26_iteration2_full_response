Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

Variables Checking: The function 'forward' uses several variables. The variable 'cot_sum_instruction' is used in the call to 'cot_agent' in Sub-task 3.2 but is never declared or defined within the function. All other variables are either declared as function parameters, local variables, or are part of the 'self' object, which is assumed to be correctly defined elsewhere in the class.
