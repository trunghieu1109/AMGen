Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 2, we determined that the elements of set A are 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. To find the sum of the elements of set A, we simply add these numbers together: 4 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. Calculating this sum gives us 49. Therefore, the sum of the elements of set A is 49.

Answer:49
Extracted answer: 49
Correct answer: 055
