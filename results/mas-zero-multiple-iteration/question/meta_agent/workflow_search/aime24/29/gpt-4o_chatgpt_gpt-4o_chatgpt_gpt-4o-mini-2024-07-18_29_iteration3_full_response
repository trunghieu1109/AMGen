Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Variables Checking: The function uses several variables that are not declared within its scope. Specifically, 'cot_sc_instruction' and 'cot_reflect_instruction' are used as arguments in function calls but are never declared or passed as parameters within the function. Additionally, 'sum' is not used in the function, so there is no undeclared variable issue related to 'sum'. All other variables are either declared within the function or are attributes of 'self', which are considered declared.
