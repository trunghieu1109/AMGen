Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the joint probability of measuring P=0 and Q=-1, we first need to analyze the probabilities derived from the measurements of the observables P and Q. The probability of measuring P=0, denoted as p0, was found to be 1/3 based on the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenspaces of the operator P. Next, we need to compute the probability p_q of measuring Q=-1 given that P=0. This involves applying the projector Q_{-1} to the post-measurement state Ïˆ_P0 obtained after measuring P=0. The calculations show that the resulting probability p_q is 1/2. Therefore, the joint probability p_joint is calculated as p_joint = p0 * p_q = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. This matches with one of the provided choices, which is 1/6. Thus, the most consistent joint probability is 1/6, corresponding to choice B.
