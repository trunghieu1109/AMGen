proposed answer: To determine the correct approximation of the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections, we analyze the provided candidate formulas against the expected structure derived from quantum field theory principles. The mass correction for H2 is expected to be proportional to 1/(8π²(x² + v²)), which is a standard factor in one-loop corrections due to symmetry breaking. The contributions to the mass squared should include positive contributions from bosonic loops (like gauge bosons and scalar fields) and negative contributions from fermionic loops (such as the top quark and singlet neutrinos). Each choice provides a different combination of these contributions. Choice C correctly includes the top-quark term (M_t^4) with a negative sign, which is crucial, as it accounts for the fermionic contribution that reduces the mass squared. It also includes the sum of the neutrino contributions (∑M_{N_i}^4) with a negative sign, reflecting the expected behavior in the context of radiative corrections. The other choices either omit necessary terms or incorrectly adjust the signs of contributions. Therefore, after thorough evaluation of all candidate formulas, choice C is the most consistent with the theoretical expectations for the one-loop mass correction of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2.
