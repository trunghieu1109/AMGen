proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the fluxes between the two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch has stopped, we need to consider the contributions of the different solar neutrino production processes. The pp-III branch primarily produces neutrinos in the higher energy range, particularly affecting the 800-900 keV band due to the production of 8B neutrinos. When this branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band will decrease significantly. In contrast, the 700-800 keV band still receives contributions from other processes like pp-I and pp-II, which continue unaffected. Therefore, while both bands will see a reduction in flux, the 800-900 keV band will experience a more substantial drop compared to the 700-800 keV band. This leads to the conclusion that the ratio of Flux(700-800 keV) to Flux(800-900 keV) will be less than 1. Given the options provided, the closest estimate for this ratio is 0.1 (10^-1), as it reflects the expected relative contributions after the stoppage of the pp-III branch. Thus, the answer is A.

proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the fluxes between the two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the stoppage of the pp-III branch, we need to analyze the contributions of neutrinos from different sources. The pp-III branch primarily produces high-energy neutrinos from the decay of 8B, which significantly contributes to the 800-900 keV band (Band 2). When this branch stops, the contributions from 8B are removed, leading to a substantial decrease in the flux for Band 2. In contrast, the 700-800 keV band (Band 1) continues to receive contributions from other sources, notably the 7Be line, which is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch. This means that Band 1 will maintain a relatively stable flux while Band 2 experiences a significant drop. Given that Band 1 will have a more substantial contribution compared to the diminished Band 2, the ratio of Flux(Band 1) to Flux(Band 2) is expected to be less than 1. Among the provided options, the closest match to the expected ratio, considering the dominance of the 7Be line in Band 1 and the significant drop in Band 2, is 0.1 (10^-1). Therefore, I conclude that the answer is A) 0.1 (10^-1).
