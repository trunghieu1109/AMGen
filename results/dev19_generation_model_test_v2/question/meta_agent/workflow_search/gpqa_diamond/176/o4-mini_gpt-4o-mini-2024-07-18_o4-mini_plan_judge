proposed answer: To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its effective temperature (T): L ∝ R²·T⁴. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5·R₂), we can express the luminosity of each star as L₁ ∝ (1.5·R₂)²·T₁⁴ and L₂ ∝ R₂²·T₂⁴. Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal, we can assume that the effective temperatures of the two stars are also equal (T₁ = T₂). Therefore, the ratio of luminosities simplifies to L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25. This calculation shows that Star_1 is approximately 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2, which aligns with the first choice provided in the options. Thus, the most consistent and logical conclusion based on the parameters given is that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.25.

proposed answer: To determine the luminosity ratio L1/L2, we start with the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that luminosity L is proportional to the square of the radius R and the fourth power of the temperature T: L ∝ R²·T⁴. Given that the radius of Star_1 (R1) is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R2), we have R1/R2 = 1.5, leading to (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. Next, we need to consider the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the stars. The observed peak emission wavelengths are equal, suggesting T1 = T2 initially. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which indicates that its light is redshifted, leading to a lower inferred temperature for Star_2 compared to Star_1. The Doppler effect implies that T2 will be less than T1. For non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate T2 as T1/(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. Given that c is approximately 300,000 km/s, we find that the correction factor for T2 is approximately 1.0023, meaning T2 ≈ T1 / 1.0023. Therefore, we can express the luminosity ratio as L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴. Substituting the values gives us L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1/(T1/1.0023))⁴ = 2.25 * (1.0023)⁴. Calculating (1.0023)⁴ gives us a value slightly greater than 1, which means L1/L2 will be greater than 2.25. The closest option to this calculated value, considering the increase from the temperature correction, is ~2.35. Thus, the answer is B.
