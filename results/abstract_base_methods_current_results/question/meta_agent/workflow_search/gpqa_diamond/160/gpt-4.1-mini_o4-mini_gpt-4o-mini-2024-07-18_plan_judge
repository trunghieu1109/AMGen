Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.

proposed answer: The mean free path λ is given by λ=1/(nσ). In the ultra‐high vacuum, σ for electron–gas scattering (σ_e) is much smaller than the gas–gas collision cross section (σ_gas). Thus when the electron beam is on, λ2=1/(nσ_e)≫1/(nσ_gas)=λ1. Empirical data confirm that λ2 increases by at least 22% compared to λ1 under these conditions, so λ2≥1.22·λ1.

proposed answer: The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collision cross section σ at a given gas density (λ = 1/(nσ)). Gas–gas collisions have σ_g ≈ 3×10^−19 m^2, whereas electron–gas collisions have σ_e ≈ 10^−21–10^−22 m^2. Thus λ2/λ1 = σ_g/σ_e ≈ 300–3000, which is far greater than 1.22. Therefore λ2 ≫ λ1 and certainly λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.
