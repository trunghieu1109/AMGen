Question: Example(question='The study of quantum mechanics deals with a lot of matrices. Consider the following matrices. \n\nW = (0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0), \nX = (i, -1, 2i; 1, 0, 1;  2i, -1, -i),\nY = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2; 0.1, 0.25, 0.1; 0.2, 0.1, 0.25)\nZ - (3, 2i, 5; -2i, -2, -4i; 5, 4i, 4)\n\nNote. The matrices are formatted such that each row of the matrix is separated by a semicolon.  \n\nBased on these matrices, choose the correct statement.\n', choice1='W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.', choice2='There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.', choice3='(e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.', choice4='Z and X represent observables.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We check each statement:

1. A) “W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.”
   - W is Hermitian and unitary (W²=I), so W itself could serve as a unitary operator. X satisfies X†=−X, so X is skew-Hermitian, not unitary; only e^X is unitary. Thus X itself cannot directly represent an evolution operator. A is false.

2. B) “There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.”
   - Since X is skew-Hermitian, e^X is unitary. Unitary operators preserve the norm of all vectors. So no vector’s norm changes under e^X. B is false.

3. C) “(e^X)*Y*(e^{−X}) represents a quantum state.”
   - Y is given as Hermitian, positive semidefinite, and has trace 1, so it is a valid density matrix (quantum state). Conjugation by a unitary U=e^X, i.e. UYU†, yields another density matrix: it remains Hermitian, positive semidefinite, and trace 1. Thus C is true.

4. D) “Z and X represent observables.”
   - Observables must be Hermitian. Z is Hermitian, but X is not (X†=−X). So D is false.

Only statement C holds.
