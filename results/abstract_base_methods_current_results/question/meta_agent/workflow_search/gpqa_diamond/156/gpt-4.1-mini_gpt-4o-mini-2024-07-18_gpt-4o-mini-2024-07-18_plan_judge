Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_156
proposed answer: The design of the real-time PCR assay for rapid and sensitive detection of the retrovirus should utilize cDNA sequencing data to create specific primers and probes. The primers must flank the target region of the viral genome and have similar melting temperatures to ensure efficient amplification. Additionally, the use of a fluorescently labeled probe enhances the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Optimizing assay conditions, such as annealing temperature and primer concentrations, is crucial for achieving reliable results. This approach aligns with the best practices for molecular diagnostics, making choice D the most appropriate option for developing an effective diagnostic kit.
