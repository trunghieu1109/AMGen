Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The consensus among the debate agents is that designing a real-time PCR assay for the detection of a retrovirus should involve sequencing the viral cDNA and then developing a real-time PCR kit. The key points in the design include selecting primers that target conserved regions of the viral genome to ensure broad detection capability, and ensuring the primers have appropriate melting temperatures to facilitate efficient annealing. The use of TaqMan probes is recommended for their high specificity and sensitivity, as they require a specific sequence to hybridize and allow for real-time monitoring of the PCR amplification. The probes should be labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher. This approach ensures high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for quick and accurate detection of the retrovirus. Therefore, the best choice is to perform cDNA sequencing and develop a real-time PCR kit, which corresponds to choice D.
