From Sub-task 1 we know H₂ is the pseudo-Goldstone of a spontaneously broken scale or global symmetry (involving ϕ and h), so at tree level it is exactly massless.

In our model, the field φ acquires a VEV x, breaking scale invariance and producing a massless Goldstone boson H₂ at tree level. However, quantum corrections from all particles whose masses depend on x and v—namely the Higgs h₁, gauge bosons W and Z, top quark, extra scalars H⁺, H⁰, A⁰, and the singlet neutrinos Nᵢ—break the symmetry explicitly at one loop. The resulting Coleman–Weinberg potential generates a mass for H₂ proportional to 1/(8π²(x²+v²)) times a weighted sum of the fourth powers of these particle masses. This dependence on the VEVs and mass spectrum ensures H₂’s pseudo‐Goldstone mass is solely radiative in origin and vanishes if any of the couplings or VEVs goes to zero.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Wza3, reviewing pseudo-Goldstone boson concept, thinking: In models with spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry (here the scale symmetry broken by ⟨φ⟩ and ⟨h⟩), the would‐be Goldstone field (the dilaton‐like H₂) is exactly massless at tree level whenever the potential has a flat (scale) direction. However, explicit breaking of scale invariance by quantum effects (e.g. gauge, Yukawa, and scalar couplings) generates a Coleman–Weinberg–type radiative potential along the flat direction. Expanding this one‐loop effective potential around the vacuum induces a mass term for H₂ proportional to the second derivative of the loop corrections. Since each particle that couples to φ or h contributes a term ∼M_i^4\u2009ln\u2009M_i^2, the resulting m²_{H₂} scales as 1/(8π²(v²+x²))∑α_iM_i^4. Thus H₂ acquires a nonzero mass entirely from loop effects, controlled by the VEVs and the spectrum of fields whose masses depend on them.; answer: The mass of H₂ is generated radiatively via the Coleman–Weinberg mechanism: quantum loops of all fields whose masses depend on the VEVs break scale invariance explicitly and induce a mass squared m²_{H₂}∼(1/8π²(v²+x²))∑_iα_iM_i⁴, explaining why H₂ is massless at tree level but acquires a loop‐suppressed mass proportional to the VEVs and the particle spectrum.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent XuRW, identifying relevant particles for one-loop corrections, thinking: The pseudo–Goldstone boson H_2 obtains its mass via the Coleman–Weinberg potential at one loop.
