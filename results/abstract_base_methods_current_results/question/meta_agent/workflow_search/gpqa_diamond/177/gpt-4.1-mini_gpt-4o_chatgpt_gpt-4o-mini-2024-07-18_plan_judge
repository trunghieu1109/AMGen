proposed answer: All agents agree that from sub-task 3, the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) is -1. Sub-task 4 concluded that the theory is not renormalizable because a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant implies non-renormalizability. The correct option must reflect both the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) and the renormalizability conclusion. Option C) states that the mass dimension \( [\kappa]_{M} = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable, which matches the results from subtasks 3 and 4. Therefore, the correct answer is C).
