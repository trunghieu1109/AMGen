To compensate, the coupling must have [κ]=4−5=−1. A coupling of negative mass dimension signals a nonrenormalizable interaction.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent NHxA, providing feedback, thinking: The chain-of-thought correctly computes that in 4D [ψ]=3/2 and [Fμν]=2, so the operator ψ̄σμνψ\u2009Fμν has dimension 3+2=5 and thus κ must carry dimension 4−5=−1. This negative mass dimension indeed signals a nonrenormalizable interaction. A limitation of this tree‐level counting is that it ignores possible anomalous dimensions arising from loop effects or the embedding in a gauge‐invariant framework, but for power‐counting renormalizability the classical dimensions suffice.; answer: The mass dimension of κ is −1 and the theory is not renormalizable.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent dNJ6, refining mass dimension of kappa, thinking: In four dimensions the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

A coupling with negative mass dimension leads to non-renormalizable interactions because loop corrections generate operators of ever-higher dimension requiring infinitely many counterterms. Therefore the theory is non‐renormalizable.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent kKQS, providing feedback, thinking: The negative mass‐dimension argument correctly identifies the σμνFμν term as perturbatively nonrenormalizable (since [κ]=−1). However, this criterion only addresses perturbative renormalizability around zero energy: as an effective field theory below a cutoff it can still be predictive, despite needing infinitely many higher‐dimension counterterms at loop level. It also omits considerations of symmetry restrictions or possible UV completions that could restore renormalizability.; answer: The mass dimension of κ is −1, so the interaction is nonrenormalizable.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent wJxV, refining renormalizability assessment, thinking: In four spacetime dimensions the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.
