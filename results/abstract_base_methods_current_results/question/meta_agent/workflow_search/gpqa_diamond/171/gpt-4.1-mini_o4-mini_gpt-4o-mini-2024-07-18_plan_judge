Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Starting from the Boltzmann distribution under LTE, the ratio of excited-state populations is 2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T₂−1/T₁)]. Taking natural logs gives ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T₂−1/T₁). Rewriting the reciprocal difference as (T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂) yields ln2=(ΔE/k)·[(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂)]. Since all answer choices differ only by the functional form in T₁ and T₂ (the constant factor ΔE/k cancels when comparing), the correct relationship is ln2=(T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂), which corresponds exactly to choice D).
