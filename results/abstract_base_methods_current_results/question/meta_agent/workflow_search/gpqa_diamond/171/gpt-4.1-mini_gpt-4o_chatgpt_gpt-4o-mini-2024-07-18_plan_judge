Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The equation derived from the Boltzmann distribution is ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). This matches choice D in the original question, which is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]. The reasoning is based on the algebraic manipulation of the expression (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) into (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2), which is a standard transformation when dealing with differences of reciprocals. All agents agree on this derivation and choice, confirming that D is the correct answer.
