Taking ln gives ln2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1). Rewriting the reciprocal difference: 1/T2 − 1/T1 = (T1 − T2)/(T1·T2). Hence ln2 ∝ (T1 − T2)/(T1·T2). Among the choices, only option D (ln(2) = [(T1 − T2)/(T1·T2)]) matches exactly. Choices A and C involve incorrect combinations of T1 and T2 (no difference or wrong sign), and B has an extra square in the denominator.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent uCiG:\nWe start from the Boltzmann relation under LTE: 2 = exp[ΔE/k·(1/T₂ − 1/T₁)].

Thus ln 2 = (ΔE/k)·[(T₁ − T₂)/(T₁·T₂)].

However, this relies on several assumptions: (1) both photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium with uniform temperature and density; (2) atomic partition functions, level degeneracies, and statistical weights are effectively identical in both stars; (3) only a simple two‐level system is considered (no higher levels or continuum effects); (4) radiative transfer, optical depth, and non‐LTE processes (e.g. overionization, radiative pumping, collisional de‐excitation) are neglected; (5) other broadening or magnetic effects are ignored.
