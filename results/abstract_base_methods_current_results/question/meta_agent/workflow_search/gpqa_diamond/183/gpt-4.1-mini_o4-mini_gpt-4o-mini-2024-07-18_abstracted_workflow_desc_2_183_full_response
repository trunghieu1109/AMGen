If we introduce it first, subsequent Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation will occur ortho (and para), giving the desired 2-tert-butyl orientation in high yield.

Installing it first on benzene maximizes ring activation and directs subsequent substitution to the correct positions. Next, Friedel–Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ installs the tert-butyl group ortho to the ethoxy substituent. Finally, nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) installs the nitro group at the remaining activated position (meta to ethoxy, ortho to tert-butyl). Introducing the nitro group last avoids deactivation issues during earlier steps, ensuring high overall yield.; answer: Ethoxy first, tert-butyl second, nitro last.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 9GAS, analyzing reactivity and directing effects, thinking: We need to install the activating, ortho/para-directing groups first so that subsequent EAS proceed in high yield; the strongly deactivating nitro group must go in last. Moreover, ethoxy (via Williamson etherification) must be installed before nitration because once the NO2 is in place the ring is too deactivated for good yields, and tert-butylation must precede etherification to avoid over-alkylation of the phenolic intermediate. Thus the ring is first alkylated with t-Bu, then converted into the ethoxy derivative, and only then is nitration carried out to introduce the nitro at the desired position.; answer: tert-butyl → ethoxy → nitro\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent NkID, determining synthetic transformations, thinking: To install the ethoxy first, we must convert benzene to phenol via nitration, reduction, diazotization, and hydrolysis, then perform a Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr). Next, Friedel–Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ installs the t-Bu ortho to the ethoxy. Finally, nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ gives the nitro at the remaining activated position.

First, the multi-step conversion from benzene to phenol (nitration→reduction→diazotization→hydrolysis) is low‐yielding and time‐consuming. Second, installing the strongly activating ethoxy group before Friedel–Crafts alkylation leads to over-alkylation and constitutional isomers unless meticulously controlled. Third, performing nitration at the end on a 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene scaffold risks poor regiocontrol and poly-nitration under harsh acids. Finally, diazonium chemistry and harsh acid treatments reduce overall yield and scalability.; answer: The main limitations are the lengthy, low-yield phenol synthesis via diazonium chemistry, overactivation by the ethoxy group causing polyalkylation and poor regioselectivity in Friedel–Crafts, and final nitration’s tendency toward mixtures and over-nitration under strong acid conditions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent NkID, refining synthetic transformations, thinking: Based on Sub-tasks 1 and 2, the ethoxy group must be introduced first via phenol formation (nitration of benzene, reduction to aniline, diazotization/hydrolysis to phenol) followed by Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), then tert-butylation (t-BuCl/AlCl₃) to install the t-butyl ortho to the ethoxy, and finally nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) to give the nitro at the remaining activated position. Among the provided sequences, only choice C follows this exact order of transformations for high regioselectivity and yield.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent G8c2, round 0, evaluating reaction sequences, thinking: We need to install an ethoxy at C‐1 before tert‐butylation (so it directs FC alkylation ortho at C‐2), then introduce the nitro at C‐3 last (meta to the ethoxy). The only sequence that does this without dead‐end deactivations is: first nitrate benzene → reduce to aniline → diazotize → hydrolyze to phenol → Williamson ether (NaOH/EtBr) to give ethoxybenzene → Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation at C-2 → final nitration to install NO₂ at C-3. Choice C is the only one that follows this exact order and uses the correct reagents at each step. Choices A, B and D either introduce tert-butyl too early, misplace sulfonations, or attempt nitrations on strongly deactivated rings, leading to poor yields or wrong regiochemistry.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent A02T, round 0, evaluating reaction sequences, thinking: Option A begins with tert-butylation then nitration, which leads to undesired regioisomers and cannot install the ethoxy group at C-1 first. Option B again starts with t-Bu/NO2 chemistry and even misuses diazotization on no aniline intermediate. Option D nitrates and reduces first but then tert-butylates before forming the ethoxy, giving poor regiocontrol and reversing the required sequence. In contrast, sequence C installs the ethoxy last via Williamson ether synthesis only after converting benzene to phenol by nitration → reduction → diazotization/hydrolysis, then tert-butylation into the activated ring and final nitration to the remaining position. This order ensures the proper directing effects and high yield of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent DGKy, round 0, evaluating reaction sequences, thinking: We need ethoxy at C1, tert‐butyl at C2 (ortho to OEt), and nitro at C3 (meta to OEt). We must introduce the deactivating nitro last, install ethoxy via Williamson on phenol, and direct nitration regioselectively using a blocking group. Only sequence C) does this: \ni) Install t‐butyl (tBu‐Cl/AlCl3). ii) Sulfonate (SO3/H2SO4) to block C4 and direct nitration at C3. iii) Nitrate (HNO3/H2SO4) to give tBu‐SO3H‐NO2. iv) Reduce nitro (Fe/HCl) to aniline. v) Diazotize (NaNO2/HCl). vi) Nitrate again if needed to introduce second nitro? (Actually this step ensures any unreacted C3 is fully nitrated if necessary.) vii) Hydrolyze diazonium to phenol (H3O+, heat). viii) Remove sulfo block (dilute H2SO4). ix) Williamson ether (NaOH/EtBr) to install ethoxy at C1. This sequence ensures high regioselectivity and yield. Other choices misorder steps or omit blocking and give mixtures.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent S0u7, round 0, evaluating reaction sequences, thinking: To get 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene in high yield and with correct regiochemistry, we need: (1) install the ethoxy via phenol formation and Williamson ether synthesis, (2) introduce tert-butyl ortho to the ether, and (3) nitrate to place the nitro at the remaining activated position. Evaluating the sequences: Choice A begins with t-butylation then multiple nitrations and reductions before ether formation—wrong order. Choice B inserts sulfonation and nitration prior to ether formation—also misordered. Choice D starts with nitration, then reduction, then t-butylation, but never properly forms the ethoxy before final nitration. Only Choice C aligns each step: it uses nitration → reduction → diazotization/hydrolysis to give phenol → Williamson ether (ethoxy) → Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation ortho to the ether → final nitration at the remaining position, ensuring the substituents end up at 1- (ethoxy), 2- (tert-butyl), and 3- (nitro).

Option B’s early sulfonation deactivates the ring, hindering later nitration and alkylation. Option D places the tert-butylation after reduction of the nitro, where an aniline directs poorly in Friedel–Crafts, causing side reactions and low yield.

It also includes an unnecessary sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) step that complicates the synthesis.\n\nSequence B sulfonates too early and nitrates the already deactivated ring after diazotization, giving low yield and mixtures of isomers. The deferent ordering of reduction and etherification steps further reduces overall efficiency.\n\nSequence D begins with nitration then reduction before tert-butylation, but the deactivated nitro group severely lowers the Friedel–Crafts yield, and later nitration after alkylation yields ortho/para mixtures.\n\nOnly Sequence C avoids these issues by:\n1) Nitration → reduction to NH2 → diazotization → hydrolysis to phenol \n2) Etherification to ethoxy \n3) Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation ortho to the ether \n4) Final nitration meta to the ether/alkyl \n\nThus, A, B, and D are eliminated due to undesired side reactions, poor regioselectivity, or low yields, leaving only C as the viable option.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent KvSU, round 0, identifying undesired steps, thinking: Option A begins with tert-butylation followed by nitration on a strongly activating tert-butyl group, giving an ortho/para mixture and subsequent steps suffer poor regiocontrol. Option B’s sulfonation on a partially deactivated ring and later diazotization/hydrolysis steps give low yields and possible over-sulfonation. Option D starts with nitration on benzene, yielding a mixture of ortho/para isomers which cannot be cleanly directed through the later alkylation and etherification steps. Sequence C avoids these issues by installing the nitro only at the final step after the activating ethoxy and tert-butyl are in place, and uses the diazonium sequence cleanly. Thus only C) remains viable.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 3XBh, round 0, identifying undesired steps, thinking: Option A begins with tert‐butylation followed by nitration on an activated ring, but further reductions and nitrations on deactivated intermediates cause poor yields and regioselectivity. Option B’s early sulfonation strongly deactivates the ring, preventing efficient subsequent Friedel–Crafts alkylation. Option D starts with nitration and reduction but then performs tert‐butylation on an already deactivated or meta‐directed ring, leading to low regioselectivity and side reactions. Only sequence C orders nitration, reduction, diazotization/hydrolysis, Williamson ether synthesis, tert‐butylation, and final nitration to exploit directing effects and maintain ring reactivity for high yield.; answer: Eliminate A, B, and D; only sequence C is viable.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, deciding elimination of poor sequences, thinking: Sequences A, B, and D each suffer from misordered steps that deactivate the ring or give poor regiocontrol during key transformations: A installs tert-butyl before etherification and repeats nitration on a deactivated ring; B’s early sulfonation and late diazotization impede efficient Friedel–Crafts alkylations; D reduces the nitro to an aniline before tert-butylation, leading to side reactions and low yields. Only sequence C preserves ring reactivity at each step—nitration → reduction → diazotization/hydrolysis → Williamson ether synthesis → tert-butylation → final nitration—thereby maximizing regiocontrol and overall yield. ; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent J5qP, selecting best reaction sequence, thinking: Sequence C maintains ring activation strategically. It begins with nitration (introducing a meta-directing nitro group), then reduces the nitro to aniline, which is converted via diazotization and hydrolysis to a phenol. Williamson ether synthesis installs the ethoxy group ortho to the nitro director, preserving regiocontrol. Next, Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation places the tert-butyl group ortho/para to the activated ether (and meta to the nitro). Finally, a second nitration installs the nitro at the remaining position. This sequence avoids deactivated intermediates, side reactions, and leverages directing effects for high yield and correct substituent positioning. Hence, C) is the correct choice.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent TYJ8, selecting best reaction sequence, thinking: Sequence C preserves ring reactivity at each step—first nitration installs the nitro at C-1, reduction to aniline enables diazotization and hydrolysis to give the phenol, which then undergoes a Williamson ether synthesis to form the ethoxy at C-1. Subsequent Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation installs the tert-butyl at C-2, and a final nitration selectively gives the nitro at C-3. This order avoids deactivated intermediates and mismatched directors, maximizing yield and regiocontrol.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 7FCg, selecting best reaction sequence, thinking: Option C sequences the functional group interconversions in the correct order to maintain ring reactivity and direct subsequent steps: first nitration at benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is reduced to aniline; diazotization followed by hydrolysis yields phenol, which upon Williamson etherification becomes ethoxybenzene. The ethoxy group then ortho-directs tert-butylation to give the 2-tert-butyl derivative. A final nitration installs the nitro at the 3-position. Other sequences either attempt Friedel–Crafts on a heavily deactivated ring, reverse the order of key transformations, or produce side reactions with amino intermediates.
