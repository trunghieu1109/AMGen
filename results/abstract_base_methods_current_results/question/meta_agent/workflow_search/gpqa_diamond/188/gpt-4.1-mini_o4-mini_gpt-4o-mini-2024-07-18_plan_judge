Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: Magnons (A), phonons (D), and pions (C) all arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries: spin-rotation in magnets, translational in crystals, and chiral in QCD. A skyrmion (B), by contrast, is a topological solitonâ€”a finite-energy, gapped field configuration stabilized by winding number rather than small gapless fluctuations around a broken-symmetry vacuum. It does not correspond to any broken continuous generator and thus is not tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
