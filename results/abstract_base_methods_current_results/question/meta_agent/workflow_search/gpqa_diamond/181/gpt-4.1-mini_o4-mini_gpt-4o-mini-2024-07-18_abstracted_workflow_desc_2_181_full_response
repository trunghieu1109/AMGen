Under these assumptions, J∝V²/L³ holds true. Choice A exactly lists a trap‐free single‐carrier device with no injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 7aUG, identifying validity conditions of Mott-Gurney equation, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation J = (9/8) ε μ V² / L³ assumes that all injected carriers contribute to space-charge-limited drift current without being trapped or recombining. For this to hold: 1) Trap‐free material: No deep or shallow traps that capture carriers, so the injected carriers form a monotonic space charge profile. 2) Single‐carrier transport: Either electrons or holes dominate, eliminating ambipolar or two‐carrier effects on the charge distribution. 3) Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier): Ensures carrier injection at the contact is not limited by Schottky barriers but by space charge in the bulk. 4) Drift‐dominated current (negligible diffusion): A strong electric field makes drift current far exceed any diffusion component, so diffusion may be ignored. Under these conditions, the simple quadratic V dependence and L⁻³ scaling of the Mott–Gurney law are valid.; answer: The key conditions are: • Trap‐free semiconductor • Single‐carrier transport (either electrons or holes) • Ideal Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) • Drift‐dominated current (negligible diffusion)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Svi8, analyzing choices against validity criteria, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device with ideal (Ohmic) contacts (no injection barriers) and drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion).

Also an Ohmic contact implies equilibrium injection without space-charge-limited barriers.
