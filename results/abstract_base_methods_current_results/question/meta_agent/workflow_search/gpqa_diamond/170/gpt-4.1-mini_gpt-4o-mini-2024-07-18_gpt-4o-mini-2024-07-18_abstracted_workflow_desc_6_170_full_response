The para-isomer will be favored for substituents that are electron-donating groups (EDGs) because they stabilize the positive charge that develops during the formation of the sigma complex in the ortho and para positions. Conversely, electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct electrophiles to the meta position, which means they will not favor the formation of the para-isomer. \n\n1) For C6H5-CH3 (methyl group), it is an EDG and directs to ortho/para, so para is favored. \n2) For C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethoxy group), it is also an EDG and directs to ortho/para, so para is favored. \n3) For C6H5-Cl (chloro group), it is a weak EDG and directs to ortho/para, so para is favored, but less than the others. \n4) For C6H5-NO2 (nitro group), it is an EWG and directs to meta, so para is not favored. \n5) For C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group), it is an EDG and directs to ortho/para, so para is favored. \n6) For C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid), it is an EWG and directs to meta, so para is not favored. \n\nThus, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer will be determined by the strength of the EDG's and the presence of EWG's, leading to the final arrangement: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl).; answer: 4<6<2<1<5<3\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Gp5k, determine regioselectivity, thinking: To determine the expected regioselectivity of electrophilic bromination for each substituted benzene, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents identified in Sub-task 1.

Electron-donating groups (EDGs) enhance the reactivity of the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct substitution to the meta position. The para-isomer is favored when multiple positions are available for substitution. For the given substances: \n\n1) С6H5-CH3: The methyl group is an EDG that directs bromination to ortho/para positions, with para being favored. \n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The ethoxy group is also an EDG, similarly favoring the para position. \n3) C6H5-Cl: The chloro group weakly donates electrons and directs to ortho/para, with para favored. \n4) C6H5-NO2: The nitro group is an EWG, directing bromination to meta, so no para product. \n5) C6H5-C2H5: The ethyl group is an EDG, directing to ortho/para, with para favored. \n6) C6H5-COOH: The carboxylic acid is an EWG, directing to meta, so no para product. \n\nThus, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer will reflect the number of EDGs that can direct bromination to the para position. The substances with EDGs will have higher para yields than those with EWGs. The expected order is: 3 (Cl) < 5 (C2H5) < 1 (CH3) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 4 (NO2), as NO2 does not contribute to para formation at all.; answer: 3<5<1<6<2<4\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ABDn, estimate para-isomer proportions, thinking: Based on the analysis of the substituents and their directing effects from Sub-task 1 and the expected regioselectivity from Sub-task 2, we can estimate the relative proportion of the para-isomer formed for each substance.

The order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is determined by the strength of the EDGs and the presence of EWGs.

The electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as –CH3 (substance 1) and –C2H5 (substance 5) will favor the formation of the para-isomer, with –C2H5 being a stronger EDG than –CH3. The –COOC2H5 (substance 2) is also an EDG but less effective than –C2H5. The –Cl (substance 3) has a moderate effect. Therefore, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) yield the least para-isomer; followed by 2 (COOC2H5) and 1 (CH3) yielding more; then 3 (Cl) yielding a moderate amount; and finally 5 (C2H5) yielding the highest amount of para-isomer.

In contrast, electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as –CH3, –COOC2H5, and –C2H5 favor para substitution. The order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is thus: 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) yield the least para-isomer; 2 (COOC2H5) and 1 (CH3) yield more; 3 (Cl) yields a moderate amount; and 5 (C2H5) yields a significant amount of para-isomer.
