Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, we sum the concentrations of free Co(II) ions and all cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. From Sub-task 6, the concentrations of the complexes are: [Co(SCN)]+ = 0.003807 M, [Co(SCN)2] = 0.001692 M, [Co(SCN)3]- = 0.00026649 M, [Co(SCN)4]2- = 0.00006768 M. The free Co(II) ion concentration from Sub-task 5 is 0.00423 M. Therefore, the total concentration of cobalt-containing species is 0.00423 + 0.003807 + 0.001692 + 0.00026649 + 0.00006768 = 0.01006317 M. The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex [Co(SCN)2] is (0.001692 / 0.01006317) * 100% ≈ 16.8%. The closest choice to 16.8% is 16.9%, which is choice A.
