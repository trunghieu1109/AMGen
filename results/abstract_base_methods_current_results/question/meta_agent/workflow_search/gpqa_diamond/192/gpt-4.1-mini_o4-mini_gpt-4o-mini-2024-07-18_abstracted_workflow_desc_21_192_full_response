Since distance r=1/p, we have p(r)=1/r. Substituting gives N(p(r))∝(1/r)⁻⁵=r⁵. To convert from per unit p to per unit r we multiply by the Jacobian |dp/dr|. Here dp/dr=−1/r² so |dp/dr|=1/r². Thus N(r)=N(p(r))·|dp/dr|∝r⁵·(1/r²)=r³. Therefore the number of stars per unit distance scales as r³, which matches choice C).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 784J:\nWe have N(p) ∝ p^(-5) and parallax p = 1/r. To find the star count per unit distance N(r), we change variables: N(p)dp = N(r)dr, so N(r) = N(p(r))·|dp/dr|. Substituting: N(p(r)) ∝ (1/r)^(-5) = r^5, and dp/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2 so |dp/dr| = 1/r^2. Therefore N(r) ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3. Matching to the choices (~r^2, ~r^4, ~r^3, ~r^5) gives ~r^3.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent zTGo:\nWe have the distribution in parallax p: N(p) ∝ p⁻⁵. With p=1/r, N(p(r)) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵. To convert to number per unit distance we multiply by the Jacobian |dp/dr| = |−1/r²| = 1/r². Thus N(r) ∝ r⁵·(1/r²) = r³. Among the options (~r², ~r⁴, ~r³, ~r⁵), the dependence is ∼r³, which corresponds to choice C.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WkO6:\nWe start from the observed relation N(p) ∝ p^{–5}. Since parallax p and distance r are inversely related (p = 1/r), substituting gives N(p(r)) ∝ (1/r)^{–5} = r^5. However, when changing variables from p to r we must include the Jacobian factor |dp/dr|. Differentiating p = 1/r yields dp/dr = –1/r^2, so |dp/dr| = 1/r^2. The number of stars per unit distance is therefore N(r) = N(p(r)) · |dp/dr| ∝ r^5 · (1/r^2) = r^3. Comparing to the options (~ r^2, ~ r^4, ~ r^3, ~ r^5), the dependence is r^3, corresponding to choice C).\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent sg66:\nC)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 784J:\nC)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent zTGo:\nC)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent WkO6:\nC)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the correct power-law dependence of the number of stars on distance r.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

To prepare for transforming variables, we simply rename the parallax variable plx to p.

Substituting N(p)∝p⁻⁵ with p=1/r gives N(r)∝r⁵·1/r²=r³.
