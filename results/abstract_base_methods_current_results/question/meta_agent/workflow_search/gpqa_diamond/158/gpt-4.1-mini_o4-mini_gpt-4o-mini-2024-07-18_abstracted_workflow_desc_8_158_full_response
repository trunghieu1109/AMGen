Comparing to the choices: 6\u2009Gpc (D) and 7\u2009Gpc (C) undershoot by 1.5–2.5\u2009Gpc, so they’re too small. 9\u2009Gpc (B) overshoots by ~0.5\u2009Gpc, which is marginally high given our estimate. 8\u2009Gpc (A) is within ~0.5\u2009Gpc of the computed value and is the closest rounded option. Therefore the best match is 8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent BlHh:\nFrom the numerical integration in a flat ΛCDM universe (H₀=70\u2009km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7), the comoving distance to z≈5.5 comes out to roughly 8.5–9\u2009Gpc. Comparing this to the discrete answer options: 6\u2009Gpc and 7\u2009Gpc are significantly lower, deviating by ∼2.5–3\u2009Gpc; 9\u2009Gpc is slightly above our estimate but within rounding error; however, most cosmological calculators often quote ≈8.3–8.7\u2009Gpc which rounds to 8\u2009Gpc. Thus the closest match among the given choices is 8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent peFY:\nUsing a flat ΛCDM model with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance integral from z≈5.5 gives D_C≈(c/H₀)∫₀^{5.5} dz\'/√[Ωₘ(1+z\')³+Ω_Λ]≈4283 Mpc×2.0–2.2≈8.5 Gpc.
