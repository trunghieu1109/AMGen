Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_158
proposed answer: Using the flat ΛCDM model (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7) and integrating D_C = (c/H₀) ∫₀^z dz′/√[Ωₘ(1+z′)³+Ω_Λ] for z≈5.5 yields approximately 8.5 Gpc. Among the provided choices (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc), 8 Gpc is closest to this value, with 9 Gpc overshooting slightly and 7 Gpc undershooting more significantly. Therefore, the best match is 8 Gpc.
