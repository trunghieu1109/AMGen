Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: In the dipole (long‐wavelength) regime, the radiated power per solid angle scales as I(θ)∝sin²θ/λ⁴. The maximum occurs at θ=90° (sin²θ=1), so normalizing by that maximum A gives f_norm(θ)=sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin30°=1/2, so f_norm=½²=1/4. The λ‐dependence remains λ⁻⁴. This exactly matches the option with fraction 1/4 and f∝λ⁻⁴, which is choice C.

proposed answer: The oscillating spheroidal charge has no monopole radiation so its leading term is the electric dipole. Dipole emission has an angular distribution ∝sin²θ, which vanishes on the symmetry (z) axis and peaks at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4. The power also scales with frequency as ω⁴ and since ω∝1/λ this gives a λ⁻⁴ dependence. These results respect symmetry (zero on axis), net charge conservation (no monopole term), and the known dipole radiation pattern, confirming that choice C is correct.
