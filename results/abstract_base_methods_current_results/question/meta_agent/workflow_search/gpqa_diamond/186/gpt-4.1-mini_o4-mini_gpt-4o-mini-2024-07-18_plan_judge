proposed answer: We evaluate each star’s signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in a 1-hour exposure against the detection threshold of S/N ≥ 10 per binned pixel. From Sub-task 4 estimates: Canopus ≈5×10^7 (detectable), Polaris ≈4×10^6 (detectable), star c (15 mag at 10 pc) ≈25 (detectable), star d (15 mag at 200 pc) ≈0.06 (not detectable), star e (15 mag at 5 pc) ≈100 (detectable), star f (15 mag at 50 pc) ≈1 (not detectable). That yields 4 detectable stars. Matching this count to the provided choices gives A).

proposed answer: We identified four stars (Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc) as detectable, each exceeding the S/N ≥10 threshold in a 1 h exposure. The other two (at 50 pc and 200 pc) fall below S/N=10. Thus the total is 4 detectable stars, which corresponds to choice A).
