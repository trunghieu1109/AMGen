Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: After reviewing the detectability of each star based on their apparent magnitudes and the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10, we find that Canopus is easily detectable due to its high brightness with an apparent magnitude of -5.5. Polaris, with an apparent magnitude of about 1.97, is also detectable. The star located at 5 pc has an apparent magnitude of 10, which is within the detectable range. However, the star at 10 pc with an apparent magnitude of 15 may not consistently achieve the required S/N, and the star at 50 pc with an apparent magnitude of 20 is too faint, while the star at 200 pc with an apparent magnitude of 25 is not detectable at all. Therefore, the stars that achieve the required S/N of at least 10 are Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc, totaling 3 detectable stars. This confirms that the answer is 3 detectable stars.
