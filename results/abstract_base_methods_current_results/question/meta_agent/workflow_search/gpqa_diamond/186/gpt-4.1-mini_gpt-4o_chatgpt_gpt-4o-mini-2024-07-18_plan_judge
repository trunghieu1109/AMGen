proposed answer: The final decision from the previous analysis concluded that 4 stars are detectable: Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. This conclusion was based on the apparent magnitudes and expected signal-to-noise ratios for a 1-hour exposure with the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Canopus and Polaris are very bright and easily detectable. The star at 10 pc, despite being at the edge of detectability, meets the S/N threshold. The star at 5 pc is also detectable as it is brighter than the limiting magnitude. The stars at 200 pc and 50 pc are too faint to be detected. Therefore, the total number of detectable stars is 4, which matches choice A).

proposed answer: From the reflection and cross-verification step, we confirmed that the stars that are both observable and detectable are Canopus, the star at RA = 0 deg, Dec = 0 deg with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag located at 10 pc (star c), and the star at 5 pc (star e). This makes a total of 3 detectable stars. Therefore, the correct count of detectable stars is 3, which matches choice B).
