Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_182
proposed answer: We determined that the reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid yields 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane with molecular formula C10H20. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as (2C + 2 – H)/2 = (2·10 + 2 – 20)/2 = (20 + 2 – 20)/2 = 1. Among the provided options (1, 3, 0, 5), only 1 matches, which corresponds to choice A).
