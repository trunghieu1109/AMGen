The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (rather than an ester or ketone, which absorb slightly higher or lower).

The sharp, strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carbonyl group. Together, these indicate a carboxylic acid functional group.; answer: The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H stretch and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent kFMP, interpreting IR spectrum data, thinking: The broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O–H stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broad and often spans a wide range due to strong hydrogen bonding. The sharp, strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carbonyl group, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid rather than an aldehyde or ketone (which typically absorb slightly differently). Combined with the MS evidence for one chlorine atom and a molecular weight of 156, the IR data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.; answer: Carboxylic acid (–COOH)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent taWY, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The 11.0 ppm singlet (1H) is the acid –COOH proton. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) indicate two sets of equivalent aromatic protons with ortho coupling (J ≈ 8 Hz), consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. With one substituent being COOH and the other Cl (from MS), this pattern matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent rqGt, providing feedback, thinking: The 1H NMR analysis correctly assigns a singlet at 11.0 ppm to the carboxylic proton and two aromatic doublets (2H each) to a para‐disubstituted benzene, but it cannot by itself prove the exact positions or identities of substituents. It also relies on idealized splitting patterns and clean integrations, both of which can be obscured by overlapping signals, solvent peaks, or concentration effects. Without coupling constants, 2D correlations, or comparison to authentic standards, ortho vs. meta vs. para assignments remain tentative.; answer: The interpretation assumes ideal splitting and equivalent sets of protons; in reality, aromatic signals can overlap or shift with concentration and hydrogen bonding. Broad COOH peaks vary with temperature and solvent. Without additional NMR experiments (COSY, HSQC) or reference spectra, the assignment of substitution pattern and substituent identity (Cl vs. other groups) remains presumptive rather than definitive.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent taWY, refining 1H NMR analysis, thinking: The singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) corresponds to a carboxylic acid –OH proton.
