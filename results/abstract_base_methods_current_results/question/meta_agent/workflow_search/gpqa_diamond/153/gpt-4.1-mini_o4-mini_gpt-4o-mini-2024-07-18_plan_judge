Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak (~32%) indicates one chlorine atom. The IR shows a broad O–H stretch (3500–2700 cm⁻¹) and a sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carboxylic acid. In the ¹H NMR, the singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) corresponds to the –COOH proton, and the two aromatic doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) reveal a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid matches the molecular weight, contains one Cl, has the carboxylic acid group, and shows the expected para pattern. Therefore, the correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
