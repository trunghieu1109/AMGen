Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_24_157
proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain produces mutant subunits that still bind wild-type subunits, forming nonfunctional heterodimers. These defective complexes cannot activate transcription and are not efficiently degraded, leading them to accumulate or aggregate. By sequestering the wild-type protein into these inactive aggregates, they cause an overall loss-of-function phenotype despite the presence of a normal allele.
