Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Mutation Y acts as a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, which means it can dimerize with the wild-type protein but forms a non-functional complex. This disrupts the normal dimerization process necessary for the transcription factor's functionality. As a result, the presence of mutation Y leads to a loss of protein dimerization and a corresponding loss-of-function phenotype, as the wild-type protein cannot effectively participate in gene transcription due to the interference caused by the mutant protein. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is loss of protein dimerization and a loss-of-function phenotype, which aligns with choice 1.

proposed answer: The selected phenotype from subtask 6, which indicates that the presence of mutation Y leads to 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', accurately reflects the dominant-negative mechanism. This is because mutation Y allows for dimerization with the wild-type protein, but the resulting complex is nonfunctional, which can lead to the wild-type protein being targeted for degradation. This aligns with the established biochemical context that dominant-negative mutations retain binding ability but disrupt normal function, thus compromising the activity of the wild-type protein. Therefore, the reasoning is consistent with the definitions and mechanisms discussed in the earlier subtasks.
