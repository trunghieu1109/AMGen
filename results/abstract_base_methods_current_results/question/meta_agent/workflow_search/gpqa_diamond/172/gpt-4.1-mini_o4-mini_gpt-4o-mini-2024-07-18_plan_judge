Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_172
proposed answer: From the uncertainty principle we found ΔE ≃ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing to the options (~10⁻¹⁹, ~10⁻¹⁸, ~10⁻¹⁶, ~10⁻¹⁷ J), the closest match is ~10⁻¹⁶ J, corresponding to choice C).
