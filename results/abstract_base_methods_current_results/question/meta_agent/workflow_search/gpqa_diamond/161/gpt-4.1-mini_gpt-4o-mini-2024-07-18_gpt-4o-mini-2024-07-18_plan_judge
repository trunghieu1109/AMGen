proposed answer: After evaluating the integral for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we find that the area element diverges as we approach the boundary defined by x^2 + y^2 = 4. The integral A = ∫∫(32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy over the region where x^2 + y^2 < 4 leads to an infinite result due to the singularity at the boundary. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite, confirming that the correct answer is A) +∞.
