The first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture occurs at an angle θ given by θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the circle. Since the diameter D is twice the radius, D = 2a. Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ / (2a).

The formula is given by θ_m = u_m * λ / (π * D), where D is the diameter of the aperture and u_m are the zeros of the Bessel function. Given that the diameter D = 2a for the circle formed by the infinitely-sided polygon, we can calculate the angular positions for the first two minima using u_1 = 3.832 and u_2 = 7.016. Plugging in these values, we have θ_1 = 3.832 * λ / (π * 2a) and θ_2 = 7.016 * λ / (π * 2a). The angular distance between the first two minima is then Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (7.016 - 3.832) * λ / (π * 2a).
