First, we calculate sin(2*phi) for phi = -pi/4: sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. Next, we calculate exp(-2*alpha^2) for alpha = 0.5: exp(-2*(0.5^2)) = exp(-0.5). Now we can substitute these values into the formula: N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5)). This simplifies to N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). The value of exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so we have N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935). The square root of 0.3935 is approximately 0.627.
