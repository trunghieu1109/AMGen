The norm is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. The components are 3i and 4. The absolute value of 3i is 3, and the absolute value of 4 is 4. Therefore, the norm is sqrt((3)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. To normalize the vector, we divide each component by the norm. Thus, the normalized vector is (3i/5, 4/5).
