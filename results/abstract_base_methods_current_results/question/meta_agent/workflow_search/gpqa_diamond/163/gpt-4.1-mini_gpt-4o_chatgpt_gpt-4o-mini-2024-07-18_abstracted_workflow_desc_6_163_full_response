For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, so the mass ratio of the two stars is the inverse of the RV amplitude ratio: M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, so the mass ratio is M1/M2 = 10/15 = 0.6667. These ratios indicate the relative masses of the stars within each system. The limitations of this calculation are that it assumes circular orbits and equal inclinations, which may not be true in reality. Additionally, it only provides relative masses, not absolute masses.; answer - System_1 has a mass ratio of 0.5, and system_2 has a mass ratio of 0.6667.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To derive the formula for the total mass M of a binary system in terms of the orbital period P and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2), we start by considering the relationship between the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital parameters. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the semi-major axis a and the orbital period P through the equation K_sum = K1 + K2 = 2πa/P. This relationship arises because the radial velocity amplitude is the component of the orbital velocity along the line of sight. \n\nNext, we use Kepler's third law, which states that the cube of the semi-major axis is proportional to the square of the orbital period, specifically a^3 = GM P^2 / (4π^2), where G is the gravitational constant and M is the total mass of the system. \n\nTo combine these, we solve for a in terms of K_sum and P: a = PK_sum / (2π). Substituting this expression for a into Kepler's third law gives us (PK_sum / (2π))^3 = GM P^2 / (4π^2). Solving for M, we get M = (P (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG). This formula relates the total mass of the binary system to the orbital period and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes. \n\nThis derivation uses the fact that the radial velocities give us direct information about the orbital velocities of the stars, and Kepler's third law relates the orbital parameters to the mass of the system.; answer - M = (P (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To calculate the total mass of each system, we use the formula M = (P (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG). For system_1, P = 2 years, K1 + K2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s. For system_2, P = 1 year, K1 + K2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s. The formula is simplified by canceling common factors when comparing the two systems. The ratio of masses M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ((K1_1 + K2_1)/(K1_2 + K2_2))^3 = (2/1) * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * 27/125 = 54/125 = 0.432. Thus, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.; answer - A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The dimensional consistency check confirms that the mass formula M = (P (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG) is correct, as the units on both sides match, resulting in units of mass (kg). The self-consistency check verifies that the computed mass ratio M1/M2 = 0.432 is correct, as the calculations for M1/M2 yield the same result of approximately 0.4. Therefore, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is indeed approximately 0.4.; answer - A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - In sub-task 5, we calculated the ratio of the total masses of system_1 to system_2 using the formula derived from the orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. The ratio M1/M2 was found to be 0.432, which means system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. To express this as a factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we interpret the ratio directly. Since 0.432 is approximately 0.4, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

The sum of the radial velocity amplitudes, K_sum = K1 + K2, is related to the orbital velocity and the semi-major axis a of the orbit by K_sum = 2πa/P. This means that the semi-major axis a can be expressed as a = (K_sum * P) / (2π). Next, we use Kepler’s third law, which states that a^3 = GM P^2 / (4π^2), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the binary system, and P is the orbital period. By substituting the expression for a from the first equation into Kepler's third law, we get ((K_sum * P) / (2π))^3 = GM P^2 / (4π^2). Solving for M, we find M = (P (K_sum)^3) / (2πG).

For system_1, P = 2 years and K1 + K2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s. For system_2, P = 1 year and K1 + K2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s. We are interested in the ratio of the masses, so we don't need to worry about the exact value of G or conversion factors. The mass ratio is (P1 * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3) / (P2 * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3). Plugging in the numbers: Mass ratio = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3) = (2 * 3375) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432.

For system_2, the period P is 1 year and the sum of the RV amplitudes is 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s. We calculate the mass ratio M1/M2 to find how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. The ratio is (P1 * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3) / (P2 * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3) = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3). Simplifying, we get (2 * 3375) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

The left side, M, has units of mass. On the right side, P is time, (K1 + K2) is velocity, and G is the gravitational constant with units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. The units of the right side are (time * (velocity)^3) / (G), which simplifies to (s * (m/s)^3) / (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) = kg. This confirms that the formula is dimensionally consistent. For self-consistency, we check the computed masses: M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ((K1_1 + K2_1)/(K1_2 + K2_2))^3 = (2/1) * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * 27/125 = 54/125 = 0.432.
