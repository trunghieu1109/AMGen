Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_163
proposed answer: The computed mass ratio factor from sub-task 5 is approximately 0.6. When comparing this value to the provided multiple-choice options, the closest match is choice C) '~ 0.6'. This is because the calculated ratio of 0.5715 is rounded to 0.6, which directly corresponds to the given option C). All debate agents agree that the closest matching choice is C) based on the computed factor. Therefore, the final decision is to select choice C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_163
proposed answer: The computed mass ratio factor from sub-task 6 is approximately 0.4, indicating that system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. The provided multiple-choice options are: A) ~ 0.4, B) ~ 0.7, C) ~ 0.6, D) ~ 1.2. The closest matching choice to the computed factor of 0.4 is option A) ~ 0.4. All the debate agents agree that the closest match is option A. Therefore, the final decision is to select option A.
