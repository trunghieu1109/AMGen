These simplifications mean the true mass ratio could differ by tens of percent, but for the coarse multiple-choice scale, ~0.4 is the best match.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Match the computed mass ratio factor to the closest provided multiple-choice option.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
