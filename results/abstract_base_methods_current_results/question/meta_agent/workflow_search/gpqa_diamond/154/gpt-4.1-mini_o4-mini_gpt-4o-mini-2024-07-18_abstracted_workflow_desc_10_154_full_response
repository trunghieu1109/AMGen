However, it is limited in that it only captures the statistical spread (standard deviation) of Pz in that idealized state. It does not account for practical measurement imprecision, systematic errors, or device resolution. It also assumes a perfectly prepared, isolated quantum system in a pure state and ignores any environmental decoherence or additional interactions.; answer: The uncertainty ΔPz=ħ/√2 applies strictly to an ideal pure state measurement of Pz and reflects only the intrinsic quantum variance. It does not include experimental uncertainties, systematic biases, or effects of decoherence and thus may underestimate real-world measurement error.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent oD5e, refining uncertainty ΔPz, thinking: We have from Sub-task 3 that ⟨Pz⟩=0 and from Sub-task 4 that ⟨Pz²⟩=ħ²/2.
