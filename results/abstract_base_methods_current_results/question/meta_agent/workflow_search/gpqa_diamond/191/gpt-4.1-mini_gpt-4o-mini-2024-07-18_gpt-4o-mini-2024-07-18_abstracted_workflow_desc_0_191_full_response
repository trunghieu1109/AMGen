When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor that exactly balances the positive charge, resulting in a total charge of -q on the inner surface. Consequently, a positive charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor, preserving the overall neutrality of the conductor. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the net charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. Since the outer surface has a charge of +q, the electric field at any point outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor is determined solely by the charge +q and its effective position, which is at the center of the conductor, not influenced by the cavity or the charge's position within it.

The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity induces a surface charge on the inner surface of the conductor, which will be negative and equal in magnitude to -q. This induced charge ensures that the electric field inside the conductor material remains zero, as per electrostatic shielding. Since the conductor is uncharged overall, an equal positive charge +q will appear on the outer surface of the conductor. Therefore, the external electric field created by this configuration depends solely on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q. The electric field at a point outside the conductor only depends on the charge +q and behaves as if it were located at the center of the conductor, regardless of the position of the charge +q within the cavity. Hence, the external electric field can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, which is proportional to 1/L^2, where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P. This confirms that the spherical conductor effectively shields the internal charge, and the electric field outside is determined solely by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent epjV, analyzing electrostatic conditions, thinking: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, which means that the net charge within the conductor is zero. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor that exactly balances the positive charge, resulting in a total charge of -q on the inner surface. Consequently, a positive charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor, preserving the overall neutrality of the conductor.

Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor is determined solely by the charge +q and its effective position, which is at the center of the conductor, not influenced by the cavity or the charge's position within it. Thus, the external electric field can be expressed as E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 83nN, analyzing electrostatic conditions, thinking: In this electrostatic scenario, we have a spherical conductor that is uncharged, meaning it has no net positive or negative charge. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, equal in magnitude to -q. This negative charge distributes uniformly over the inner surface of the cavity due to the spherical symmetry. Consequently, an equal positive charge of +q appears on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field inside the conductor itself is zero due to electrostatic shielding, and thus, the external electric field at any point outside the conductor only depends on the net charge on the outer surface, which is +q. The position of this charge effectively acts as if it is located at the center of the spherical conductor for points outside it. Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is determined solely by the positive charge +q, and the geometry of the cavity does not affect the external field as long as we are outside the conductor. Hence, the answer to the sub-task is that the external electric field depends only on the net charge and its effective position, confirming the shielding effect of the conductor.; answer: C\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent T68f, deriving symbolic electric field expression, thinking: The spherical conductor is uncharged, and when a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, resulting in a positive charge of +q on the outer surface. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. Since the outer surface has a charge of +q, the electric field at any point outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor is given by E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.
