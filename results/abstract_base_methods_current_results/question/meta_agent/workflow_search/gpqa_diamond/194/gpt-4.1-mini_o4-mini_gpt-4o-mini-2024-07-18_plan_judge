Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_194
proposed answer: The computed maximum orbital period of the second planet using Kepler’s third law is approximately 31–33 days. Among the given options (~7.5, ~33.5, ~37.5, ~12.5 days), the value ~33.5 days matches closest to the calculated period. Hence, choice B) is the best match.
