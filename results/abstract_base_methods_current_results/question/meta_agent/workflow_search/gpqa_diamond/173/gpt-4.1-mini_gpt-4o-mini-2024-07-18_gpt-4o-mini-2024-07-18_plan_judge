Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_173
proposed answer: The analysis indicates that the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical kinetic energy T1 has been determined to be 10 MeV. This value matches one of the provided options in the multiple-choice answers. The relativistic effects are significant in this scenario, leading to a higher kinetic energy than what would be predicted by classical mechanics. Therefore, the correct answer choice that corresponds to this difference is 10 MeV, which is option A.
