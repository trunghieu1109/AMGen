Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The nucleus of rest‐mass energy 300 GeV splits into fragments of rest‐mass 0.66 M and 0.33 M, so the mass defect is Q=(M−(m1+m2))c²=0.01·300 GeV=3 GeV. By momentum conservation and relativistic kinematics, one finds the more massive fragment’s kinetic energy T1_rel≈1.005 GeV. The nonrelativistic (classical) estimate is T1_nr=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·0.33/0.99≈1.000 GeV. Their difference ΔT1≈1.005−1.000=0.005 GeV, i.e. 5 MeV, which corresponds to choice B).
