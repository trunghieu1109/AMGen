Each of the issues listed—mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion—can indeed lead to subtle errors. Mutually incompatible data formats can cause data to be misinterpreted or processed incorrectly without obvious signs. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion can lead to alignment errors that are not immediately apparent, as the presence or absence of 'chr' in chromosome names can cause mismatches in data processing. Reference assembly mismatch can result in incorrect genomic coordinates being used, leading to errors that are difficult to trace back to the assembly version mismatch. Incorrect ID conversion can cause annotation errors, where gene or transcript IDs are incorrectly mapped, leading to downstream analysis errors that are not easily detected.

Mutually incompatible data formats can cause subtle errors in data processing if not handled correctly, as different tools may interpret the data differently. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion can lead to misalignments or failures in data processing pipelines that expect a specific format, and such errors are not always obvious without careful checking. Reference assembly mismatch is another common issue where data aligned to different reference genomes can lead to incorrect conclusions, and these mismatches can be very subtle and hard to detect without thorough validation. Incorrect ID conversion can cause annotation errors that may only be discovered through meticulous cross-referencing.
