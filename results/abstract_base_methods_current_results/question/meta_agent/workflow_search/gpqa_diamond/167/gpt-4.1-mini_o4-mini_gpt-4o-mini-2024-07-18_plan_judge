Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: Among the four listed issues, chromosome naming inconsistencies (“chr” versus “no chr”) and reference assembly mismatches are the most insidious. They often slip through pipelines without triggering errors yet systematically distort downstream analyses. The other issues—mutually incompatible formats or incorrect ID conversions—tend to produce more obvious failures or can be detected by standard validation steps. Therefore, the two hardest-to-spot error sources are issues 2 and 3, matching answer choice B).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: All four listed issues—mutually incompatible data formats, the “chr”/“no chr” confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion—are well documented to cause silent data losses or misannotations without obvious errors. Excluding any one would overlook a major source of stealthy errors. Therefore, the comprehensive choice capturing all these common pitfalls is “All of the above.”
