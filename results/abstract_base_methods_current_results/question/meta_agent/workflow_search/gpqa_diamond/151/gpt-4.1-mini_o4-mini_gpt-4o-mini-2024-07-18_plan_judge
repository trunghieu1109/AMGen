Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: Active chromatin in the shmoo is dedicated to transcriptional activation and thus enriched for transcription initiation factors (e.g., the pre-initiation complex), regulatory proteins at enhancers (enhancer protein complex), and core histones in remodeled nucleosomes. By contrast, the pre-replication complex assembles specifically at replication origins during G1/S to license DNA synthesis and is not associated with promoter or enhancer regions in highly transcribed chromatin. Moreover, pre-RC components are transient, low-abundance, and cell-cycle–restricted, making them the least likely to co-immunoprecipitate in a ChIP–MS assay of active shmoo chromatin.
