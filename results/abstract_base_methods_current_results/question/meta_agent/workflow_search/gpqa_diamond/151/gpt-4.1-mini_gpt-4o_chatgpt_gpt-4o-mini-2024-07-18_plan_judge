Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_57_151
proposed answer: The shmoo is a cellular state in yeast where the cell is preparing for mating and is arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. During this state, transcriptional activity is more relevant than DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are all involved in transcriptional processes and chromatin remodeling, which are active during this phase. In contrast, the pre-replication complex is involved in the initiation of DNA replication, a process that is not active in the shmoo state. Therefore, the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be detected in the active chromatin proteome of the shmoo using ChIP-MS.
