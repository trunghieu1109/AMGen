Hence any eigenvector |ψ⟩ of σ·n with eigenvalue λ obeys (σ·n)^2|ψ⟩ = λ^2|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩, so λ^2=1 and λ=±1. These are the only possible eigenvalues.; answer: ±1\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent m7ZJ, recall eigenvalues of σ·n, thinking: The operator σ·n is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices with coefficients n_i that satisfy n·n=1. Since the Pauli matrices obey (σ·n)^2 = σ_x^2 n_x^2 + σ_y^2 n_y^2 + σ_z^2 n_z^2 + cross terms, but due to their anticommutation relations the cross terms cancel and each σ_i^2 = I. Thus (σ·n)^2 = I. An operator whose square is the identity must have eigenvalues λ satisfying λ^2=1, i.e. λ=±1. Hence the eigenvalues of σ·n are +1 and -1.; answer: +1, -1\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent kBJ8, determine eigenvalues of H, thinking: We know σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 since (σ·n)^2=I for unit vector n and Pauli matrices. The Hamiltonian H=ε(σ·n) thus has eigenvalues ε·(±1)=±ε. These have correct energy dimensions (ε has dimension of energy). Hence the eigenvalues are +ε and –ε, corresponding to choice A.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent J1MF, providing feedback, thinking: The determination that H=ε\u2009σ·n has eigenvalues ±ε is straightforward because for any unit vector n, (σ·n)^2=I so σ·n has eigenvalues ±1; multiplying by ε yields ±ε. Limitations: (1) This applies only to a pure two‐level spin‐½ system without additional terms (e.g. no external potentials or Zeeman splitting beyond ε\u2009σ·n). (2) We assume ε itself already carries energy units and omit any ℏ factors; if ε were defined differently (e.g. proportional to ℏ), eigenvalues would change accordingly. (3) The result ignores degenerate subspaces if n is not uniquely specified, and neglects any coupling to other degrees of freedom.; answer: ±ε\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent kBJ8, refining eigenvalues of H, thinking: The operator σ·n for a unit vector n satisfies (σ·n)^2=I, so its eigenvalues are ±1.
