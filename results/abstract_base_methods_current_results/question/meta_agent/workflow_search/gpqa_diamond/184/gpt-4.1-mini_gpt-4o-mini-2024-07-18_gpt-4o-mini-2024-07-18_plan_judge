Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The calculated eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ε σ · n are +ε and -ε. This is derived from the properties of the Pauli matrices, where the eigenvalues of σ · n are +1 and -1, and multiplying these by the constant ε gives us the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Now, comparing the provided options: Option A) +ε, -ε matches our calculated eigenvalues exactly, making it the correct choice. Option B) +ε ħ/2, -ε ħ/2 incorrectly introduces an additional factor of ħ/2, which is not part of our calculation. Option C) +1, -1 is dimensionless and does not include the necessary factor of ε, thus it is incorrect. Option D) +ħ/2, -ħ/2 also incorrectly introduces ħ/2 without justification. Therefore, the only correct choice that reflects the eigenvalues we derived is Option A.
