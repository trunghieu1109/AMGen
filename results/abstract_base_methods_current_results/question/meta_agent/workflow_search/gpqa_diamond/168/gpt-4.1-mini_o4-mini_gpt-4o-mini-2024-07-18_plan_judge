Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original four-body decay 2A→2B+2E+2V the E particles share the Q-value continuously among four products, giving a continuous spectrum up to endpoint Q. Replacing the two massive V’s by a single massless M yields a three-body decay 2A→2B+2E+M, which still allows a continuous energy distribution among the three products. Because M is massless, it requires no rest-mass energy, so more of the available Q can go into the kinetic energy of the E particles, raising the maximum E energy above the original endpoint Q. Thus the spectrum remains continuous and its endpoint increases.
