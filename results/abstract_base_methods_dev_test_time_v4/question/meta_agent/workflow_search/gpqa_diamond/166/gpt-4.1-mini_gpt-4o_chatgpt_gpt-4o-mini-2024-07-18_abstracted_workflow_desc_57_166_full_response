From Sub-task 4, we know that the entropy of rho is zero because it is a pure state. The entropy of tau was calculated to be 1.38 using the symplectic eigenvalue method. Therefore, del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau)) = 0 - 1.38 = -1.38. However, the non-Gaussianity measure is typically reported as a positive value, so we take the absolute value, which is 1.38. This positive value indicates the presence of non-Gaussianity, which is consistent with the Schrödinger cat state being a superposition of coherent states, known to be non-Gaussian.

Specifically, for a coherent state |alpha>, we have 〈q〉 = sqrt(2) * Re(alpha) and 〈p〉 = sqrt(2) * Im(alpha). The second moments are given by 〈q²〉 = 1/2 + 2 * (Re(alpha))² and 〈p²〉 = 1/2 + 2 * (Im(alpha))². In our case, alpha = 0.5, which is real, so Im(alpha) = 0 and Re(alpha) = 0.5.

The density matrix rho is constructed from the Schrödinger cat state and is expressed in the coherent state basis. It is a pure state, which implies that its von Neumann entropy is zero because pure states have zero entropy. Therefore, trace(rho * ln(rho)) = 0. On the other hand, tau is a thermal Gaussian state with zero mean and a given covariance matrix. Thermal states have a known entropy formula related to their eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a thermal state with covariance matrix \\( \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle q^2 \\rangle & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\langle p^2 \\rangle \\end{pmatrix} \\) can be computed, and the von Neumann entropy for a thermal state is given by \\( S(\\tau) = (\\nu + 1) \\ln(\\nu + 1) - \\nu \\ln \\nu \\), where \\( \\nu \\) is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. In this case, the symplectic eigenvalue \\( \\nu = \\sqrt{\\langle q^2 \\rangle \\langle p^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{1 \\times 1/2} = \\sqrt{1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\).

The density matrix rho is constructed from the Schrödinger cat state and is expressed in the coherent state basis. It is a pure state, which implies that its von Neumann entropy is zero because pure states have zero entropy. Therefore, trace(rho * ln(rho)) = 0. On the other hand, tau is a thermal Gaussian state with zero mean and a given covariance matrix. Thermal states have a known entropy formula related to their eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a thermal state with covariance matrix \\( \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle q^2 \\rangle & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\langle p^2 \\rangle \\end{pmatrix} \\) can be computed, and the von Neumann entropy for a thermal state is given by \\( S(\\tau) = (\\nu + 1) \\ln(\\nu + 1) - \\nu \\ln \\nu \\), where \\( \\nu \\) is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.

For the density matrix rho, which is expressed in the coherent state basis, the calculation of the entropy involves finding its eigenvalues and using them to compute the logarithm and trace. The density matrix rho is given as a combination of coherent states, and its eigenvalues can be found by diagonalizing the matrix. The eigenvalues of rho are related to the normalization factor and the overlap between coherent states. For tau, which is a thermal Gaussian state, the eigenvalues are determined by the covariance matrix. Since tau is a Gaussian state with a covariance matrix of \\( \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\), its entropy can be computed using the formula for the entropy of a Gaussian state, which involves the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The symplectic eigenvalues are related to the variances \\( \\langle q^2 \\rangle \\) and \\( \\langle p^2 \\rangle \\). Therefore, we calculate the entropy for tau using these symplectic eigenvalues.

Its entropy can be complex to compute directly, but we can use its eigenvalues to find trace(rho * ln(rho)). The density matrix tau is a thermal Gaussian state with a covariance matrix. Its entropy can be computed using the formula for the entropy of a Gaussian state in terms of its symplectic eigenvalues. For a thermal state with covariance matrix Σ, the symplectic eigenvalues determine the entropy. The entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix Σ = diag(1, 1/2) can be found using the formula S(tau) = g(n), where n is the mean thermal photon number related to the symplectic eigenvalues.

Therefore, trace(rho * ln(rho)) = 0. For the reference Gaussian state tau, we calculated its entropy using the symplectic eigenvalue method, which resulted in a non-zero value. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity, del_b, is given by the difference: del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau)). Since trace(rho * ln(rho)) = 0, del_b is simply the negative of the entropy of tau. In Sub-task 4, the entropy of tau was calculated to be 1.38. Therefore, del_b = 0 - 1.38 = -1.38.
