Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_156
proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, the goal is to develop and validate a real-time PCR molecular diagnostic kit using the primers and probes designed in Sub-task 4. The validation process involves ensuring that the kit is sensitive and specific for detecting the retrovirus. This task is a continuation of the work done in Sub-task 4, where the primers and probes were designed based on the cDNA sequence of the virus. The iterative reflection process in validation ensures that the kit performs accurately and reliably. Among the original choices, Choice 4 is the most appropriate because it involves cDNA sequencing and the development of a real-time PCR kit, which aligns with the task of developing and validating the kit using the designed primers and probes. Therefore, the answer remains consistent with Choice 4.
