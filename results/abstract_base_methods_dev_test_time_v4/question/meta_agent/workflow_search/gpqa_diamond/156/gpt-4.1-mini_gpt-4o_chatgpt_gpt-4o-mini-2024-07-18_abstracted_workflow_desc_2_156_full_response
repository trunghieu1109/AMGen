First, the virus is identified by performing cDNA sequencing, which allows for the design of specific primers and probes. These are then used to develop a real-time PCR kit. The validation process ensures that the kit is sensitive and specific for detecting the retrovirus. However, there are limitations to this approach. One limitation is that the accuracy of the kit depends on the quality of the cDNA sequencing and the design of the primers and probes. If the virus mutates, the primers and probes may no longer be effective, leading to false negatives. Additionally, the PCR kit requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, which may not be available in all settings. Finally, the kit may not be able to distinguish between active and past infections, as it detects viral genetic material rather than the presence of live virus.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Develop and validate a real-time PCR molecular diagnostic kit using the designed primers and probes to ensure sensitivity and specificity for rapid detection, based on Sub-task 4 outputs.
