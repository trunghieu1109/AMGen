Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The task is to determine the correct answer choice for the Michael addition reactions based on the predicted products from the sub-tasks. The predicted products are: For reaction A, trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate; for reaction B, 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile; and for reaction C, 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Comparing these with the provided choices: Choice 1 has the correct product for A and B, but the wrong product for C. Choice 2 and 3 have incorrect products for A and B. Choice 4 has the correct products for A and B, and the reactant for C matches, but the product for C is not exactly as predicted. However, choice 4 is the closest match overall, as it correctly identifies the reactants and products for A and B, and the reactant for C. Therefore, the correct overall answer is choice D.
