Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_157
proposed answer: Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is a dominant-negative mutation, which means the mutant protein can interact with the wild-type protein but prevents the complex from functioning properly. This typically results in a loss-of-function phenotype because the mutant protein interferes with the normal function of the transcription factor. The most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation because the mutant protein binds to the wild-type protein, forming aggregates that do not function correctly. This aggregation results in a loss-of-function phenotype, as the transcription factor cannot properly dimerize and perform its role in gene transcription. Therefore, the most consistent choice with the effects of mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, as described in Choice B.
