Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_163
proposed answer: The total mass of system_1 was calculated as 843.75 and the total mass of system_2 as 15625. The ratio of system_1's mass to system_2's mass is 843.75 / 15625 = 0.054. This indicates that system_1 is less massive than system_2. The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is misleading because system_1 is actually less massive. The closest choice to this ratio, considering the options provided, is ~0.6, which reflects an approximation of how much less massive system_1 is compared to system_2. Therefore, the choice is C).

proposed answer: The computed mass ratio factor from the sub-tasks is approximately 0.4. All agents agree that this factor is closest to the provided multiple-choice option A) ~ 0.4. The calculations and reasoning provided by the agents consistently point to this choice as the best match for the computed value. Therefore, the final decision on the closest multiple-choice option for the mass ratio factor is A).
