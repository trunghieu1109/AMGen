Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature.

proposed answer: In the scenario, λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum without electron interactions. When the electron beam is introduced, λ2 represents the mean free path considering electron scattering with gas molecules. Electrons generally have smaller scattering cross-sections than gas molecules, allowing them to travel further before scattering. Therefore, λ2 is expected to be greater than λ1. The choice 'λ2 >= 1.22*λ1' (option D) reflects this understanding, as it suggests a significant increase in mean free path due to electron scattering. Although the factor of 1.22 is somewhat arbitrary, it indicates the expected trend of λ2 being greater than λ1. All debate agents agree on this conclusion, making option D the most appropriate choice.

proposed answer: In the scenario, λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules in a vacuum, determined by the gas-gas collision cross section. When the electron beam is activated, λ2 becomes the mean free path for electrons, determined by the electron-gas scattering cross section. At high electron energies, such as 1000 kV, the electron-gas scattering cross section is much smaller than the gas-gas collision cross section, because high-energy electrons are less likely to interact with gas molecules. This results in a longer mean free path for electrons compared to gas molecules, meaning λ2 is greater than λ1. The choice D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is supported by the significant difference in scattering cross sections, which is consistent with empirical observations of high-energy electron behavior. Therefore, the assumption that σ_electron is much smaller than σ_gas is validated, leading to the conclusion that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.
