Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_155
proposed answer: The chemist performs two reactions, each yielding a pair of enantiomers. Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene both produce trans-diols, but they are different diastereomers. In standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers co-elute, so we see 2 peaks corresponding to the two unique diastereomeric trans-diols. In chiral HPLC, enantiomers are resolved, so we see 4 peaks: two peaks for each pair of enantiomers from the two reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_155
proposed answer: The standard (achiral) HPLC will show 2 peaks because it cannot resolve enantiomers, resulting in one peak for the meso diol and another peak for the pair of enantiomers. The chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks because it can resolve enantiomers, resulting in separate peaks for the meso diol and each enantiomer. Comparing these predictions with the provided choices: Choice 1 suggests 4 peaks in both chromatograms, which is incorrect. Choice 2 suggests 3 peaks in standard and 4 in chiral, which is incorrect. Choice 3 suggests 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral, which matches our predictions. Choice 4 suggests 2 peaks in both, which is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice 3.
