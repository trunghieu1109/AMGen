Mutually incompatible data formats refer to the problem where different tools or datasets use different formats, leading to errors when integrating or analyzing data. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion arises when some datasets include the 'chr' prefix in chromosome names (e.g., 'chr1') while others do not (e.g., '1'), causing mismatches. Reference assembly mismatch occurs when data is aligned to different versions of the reference genome, leading to inconsistencies. Incorrect ID conversion happens when gene or variant identifiers are incorrectly mapped or converted, leading to errors in downstream analysis.

The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion is common when merging datasets with different chromosome naming conventions, causing mismatches in data alignment or annotation. Reference assembly mismatch occurs when datasets are aligned to different versions of the reference genome, leading to discrepancies in genomic coordinates and annotations. Incorrect ID conversion happens when gene or variant identifiers are mapped incorrectly, often due to differences in naming conventions or outdated databases.

Mutually incompatible data formats can occur when integrating data from different sources, such as combining sequencing data from different platforms or analysis tools that use different file formats (e.g., VCF vs. GFF). This can lead to errors if the data is not properly converted or standardized. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion is a common issue when integrating datasets from different sources, as some may include the 'chr' prefix in chromosome names while others do not, leading to mismatches in data alignment or interpretation. Reference assembly mismatch is a critical issue when comparing datasets aligned to different versions of the reference genome, such as GRCh37 vs. GRCh38, which can lead to incorrect variant calling or annotation. Incorrect ID conversion can occur when converting gene or variant identifiers between different databases or formats, leading to incorrect mapping and interpretation of results. These issues are common sources of difficult-to-spot errors, but the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion and reference assembly mismatch are particularly prevalent and problematic, as they directly affect data alignment and interpretation, leading to significant errors if not addressed.
