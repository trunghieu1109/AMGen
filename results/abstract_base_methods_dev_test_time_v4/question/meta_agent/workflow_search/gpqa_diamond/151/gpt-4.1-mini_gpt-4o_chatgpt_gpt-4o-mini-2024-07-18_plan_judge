Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_39_151
proposed answer: All agents agree that during shmoo formation in yeast, the active chromatin is primarily involved in transcriptional activation rather than DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are all associated with transcription and chromatin structure, making them likely to be present in active chromatin. The pre-replication complex, however, is associated with DNA replication, which is not the focus during transcriptional activation in the shmoo. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex would be least observed in the assay targeting the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo.
