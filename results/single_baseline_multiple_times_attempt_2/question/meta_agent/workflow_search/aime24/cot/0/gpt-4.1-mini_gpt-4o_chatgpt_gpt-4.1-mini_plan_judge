Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, we need to determine Aya's walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. Given that when Aya walks at speed s km/h, the total time for her walk and coffee shop is 4 hours. When she walks at speed s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's set up the equations: 

1. At speed s, the walk takes 9/s hours. Including t minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 4 hours, so 9/s + t/60 = 4.

2. At speed s+2, the walk takes 9/(s+2) hours. Including t minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, so 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, solve these equations simultaneously:

From equation 1: t/60 = 4 - 9/s.
From equation 2: t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s+2).

Equate the two expressions for t/60:

4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s+2).

Solve for s:

1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s+2).

Multiply through by s(s+2) to clear the fractions:

1.6s(s+2) = 9(s+2) - 9s.

1.6s^2 + 3.2s = 18.

Solve this quadratic equation:

1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0.

Divide through by 1.6:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Use the quadratic formula: s = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4*1*(-11.25)))/2.

s = (-2 ± √(4 + 45))/2.

s = (-2 ± √49)/2.

s = (-2 ± 7)/2.

s = 2.5 (since speed cannot be negative).

Now, find t using s = 2.5:

9/2.5 + t/60 = 4.

3.6 + t/60 = 4.

t/60 = 0.4.

t = 24 minutes.

Now, find the time taken when Aya walks at s + 0.5 km/h:

s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

Time taken for the walk = 9/3 = 3 hours.

Including 24 minutes in the coffee shop, total time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3.4 hours.

Convert 3.4 hours to minutes:

3.4 hours = 3*60 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Therefore, the total time including the coffee shop is 204 minutes.
