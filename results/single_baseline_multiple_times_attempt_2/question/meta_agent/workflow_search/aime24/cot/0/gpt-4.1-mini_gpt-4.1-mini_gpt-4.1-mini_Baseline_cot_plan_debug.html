    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let s be Aya&#39;s walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total time for the walk plus coffee break is given. First, convert all times to hours for consistency. 

1. When walking at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours. This includes walking time plus coffee time t minutes = t/60 hours.
   So, walking time + coffee time = 4 hours
   Walking time = 9/s hours
   Coffee time = t/60 hours
   Equation: 9/s + t/60 = 4

2. When walking at speed s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.
   Walking time + coffee time = 2.4 hours
   Walking time = 9/(s+2) hours
   Coffee time = t/60 hours
   Equation: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

From these two equations:
Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(9/s - 9/(s+2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 4 - 2.4
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):
9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6 s (s+2)
9s + 18 - 9s = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s
18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Rewrite:
1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0
Divide all terms by 1.6:
s^2 + 2 s - 11.25 = 0

Solve quadratic equation:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4*11.25)]/2
= [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2
= [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2
= [-2 ± 7]/2

Two solutions:
s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5
s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 (not valid as speed cannot be negative)

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Find t using equation 1:
9/s + t/60 = 4
9/2.5 + t/60 = 4
3.6 + t/60 = 4
t/60 = 0.4
t = 24 minutes

Now, find the total time when walking at speed s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.
Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours
Coffee time = t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours
Total time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes

Therefore, the total time including coffee break is 204 minutes.
