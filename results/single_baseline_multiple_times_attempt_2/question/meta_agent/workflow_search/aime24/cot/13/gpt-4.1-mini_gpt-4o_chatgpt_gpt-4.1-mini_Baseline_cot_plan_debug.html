    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>Let&#39;s consider the arrangement of the circles. We have 8 circles of radius 34 tangent to each other and tangent to the sides AB and BC of triangle ABC. The centers of these circles form a polygonal chain, and the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is twice the radius, which is 68. The total length of this chain, considering 8 circles, is 7 times 68, which is 476. Similarly, for 2024 circles of radius 1, the distance between centers is 2, and the total length is 2023 times 2, which is 4046. In both cases, the chain represents a portion of the incircle&#39;s perimeter. The inradius is the same for both configurations, and it can be determined by the ratio of the total lengths. The ratio of the lengths is 4046/476, which simplifies to 1013/119. Since the inradius is the same for both configurations, we can express it as 34 times this ratio. Therefore, the inradius r is 34 * 1013/119. Simplifying this expression gives r = 34442/119. The greatest common divisor of 34442 and 119 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form. Thus, m = 34442 and n = 119, giving m+n = 34561.
