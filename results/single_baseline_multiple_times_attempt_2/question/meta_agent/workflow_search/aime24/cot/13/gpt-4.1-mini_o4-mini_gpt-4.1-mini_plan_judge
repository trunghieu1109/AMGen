Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Interpret the chain of n equal circles of radius r sitting in triangle ABC along base AC, each circle tangent to AC and its neighbors, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last to BC.  If cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=C, one finds AC = r[C+2(n−1)].  Equating for r=34,n=8 and r=1,n=2024 gives 34(C+14)=C+4046 ⇒ C=1190/11.  Then the inradius r_tri satisfies cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=AC/r_tri⇒r_tri=AC/C=(C+4046)/C=1344/35=192/5, so m+n=192+5=197.
