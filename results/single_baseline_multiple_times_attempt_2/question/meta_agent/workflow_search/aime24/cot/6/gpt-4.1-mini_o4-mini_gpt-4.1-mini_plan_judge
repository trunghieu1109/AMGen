Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We seek the maximum possible space‐diagonal length D = sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2) for a rectangular box with xy+yz+zx=27 and xyz=23. The minimal containing sphere radius is r = D/2, so r^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2)/4.

By symmetry and the method of Lagrange multipliers (or by the idea that at the extremum two dimensions are equal), set y=z=t and x=u. Then:
  xy+yz+zx = 2ut + t^2 = 27,
  xyz = u t^2 = 23  => u = 23/t^2.
Substitute into the first: 2*(23/t^2)*t + t^2 = 46/t + t^2 = 27,
  multiply by t: t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0.
Check t=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0, so t=2, thus u = 23/4.

Then x^2+y^2+z^2 = (23/4)^2 + 2*(2^2) = 529/16 + 8 = 657/16,
so r^2 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64. These are relatively prime, so p+q = 657 + 64 = 721.
