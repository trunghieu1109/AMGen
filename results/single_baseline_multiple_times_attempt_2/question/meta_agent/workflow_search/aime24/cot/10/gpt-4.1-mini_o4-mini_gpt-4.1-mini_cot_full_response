Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bVs3', content='Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, let E=(x,16) and F=(x+184,16). Rectangle EFGH has FG perpendicular to EF of length 17, so G=(x+184,33) and H=(x,33). The circle through A and D is x^2+y^2+ux-16y=0. Imposing H and G lie on it gives x=3. Thus E=(3,16) and C=(107,16), so CE=107-3=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
