Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: We are given two rectangles, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, with $D, E, C, F$ being collinear. Also, $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle. We need to find the length of $CE$. Since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, $CE$ is part of the line segment $DECF$. We are given the lengths of the sides of the rectangles: $BC = 16$, $AB = 107$, $FG = 17$, and $EF = 184$. Since $BC$ and $FG$ are parallel, and $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, $CE$ is the difference between $EF$ and $BC$. Therefore, $CE = EF - BC = 184 - 16 = 168$.
