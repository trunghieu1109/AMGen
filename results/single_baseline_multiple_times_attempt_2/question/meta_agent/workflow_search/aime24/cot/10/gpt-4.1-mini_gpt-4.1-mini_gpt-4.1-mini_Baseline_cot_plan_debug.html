    <pre>Given rectangles ABCD and EFGH, we know the following: ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16, and EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. 

Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are perpendicular and lengths are as given. We can place ABCD on a coordinate plane for convenience.

Let&#39;s place rectangle ABCD such that:
- A at (0,0)
- B at (107,0) since AB=107
- C at (107,16) since BC=16
- D at (0,16)

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means points D(0,16), E, C(107,16), and F lie on a straight line.

Since D and C have the same y-coordinate (16), the line through D, C is the horizontal line y=16.

Therefore, points E and F also lie on y=16.

Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF is perpendicular to FG.

Since EF lies on y=16 (horizontal line), EF must be horizontal with length 184.

So, if E is at (x,16), then F is at (x+184,16).

FG is perpendicular to EF, so FG is vertical with length 17.

Therefore, G is at (x+184,16-17) or (x+184,33) depending on orientation.

Similarly, H is at (x, 16-17) or (x, 33).

Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We know:
- A at (0,0)
- D at (0,16)
- H at (x, y_H)
- G at (x+184, y_G)

Since H and G are vertically aligned with E and F, and E and F lie on y=16, then H and G must be at y=16 ± 17 = -1 or 33.

Let&#39;s assume H and G are at y = -1 (below line y=16), so:
- H at (x, -1)
- G at (x+184, -1)

Now, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(x+184,-1) lie on a circle.

We need to find x such that these four points are concyclic.

The general condition for four points to be concyclic is that the determinant of their coordinates satisfies the cyclic condition, but here we can use the fact that the circle passes through A and D, and also through H and G.

The circle passing through A(0,0) and D(0,16) has center on the perpendicular bisector of AD.

AD vertical segment from (0,0) to (0,16), midpoint at (0,8).

Perpendicular bisector of AD is the horizontal line y=8.

So the center of the circle is at (h,8) for some h.

The radius squared is (0 - h)^2 + (0 - 8)^2 = h^2 + 64.

Since H(x,-1) lies on the circle, its distance from center (h,8) is also radius:

(x - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = h^2 + 64

(x - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64

(x - h)^2 = h^2 + 64 - 81 = h^2 - 17

Expanding (x - h)^2 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2

So x^2 - 2hx + h^2 = h^2 - 17

x^2 - 2hx = -17

Similarly, G(x+184,-1) lies on the circle:

(x + 184 - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = h^2 + 64

(x + 184 - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64

(x + 184 - h)^2 = h^2 -17

Expanding:
(x + 184 - h)^2 = (x - h + 184)^2 = (x - h)^2 + 2*184*(x - h) + 184^2

From above, (x - h)^2 = h^2 - 17

So:
(x + 184 - h)^2 = h^2 - 17 + 2*184*(x - h) + 184^2

Set equal to h^2 - 17:

h^2 - 17 + 2*184*(x - h) + 184^2 = h^2 - 17

2*184*(x - h) + 184^2 = 0

368*(x - h) + 33856 = 0

368x - 368h + 33856 = 0

Recall from earlier: x^2 - 2hx = -17

From this, solve for h:

x^2 - 2hx = -17

2hx = x^2 + 17

h = (x^2 + 17)/(2x)

Substitute h into the linear equation:

368x - 368 * ((x^2 +17)/(2x)) + 33856 = 0

Multiply both sides by 2x to clear denominator:

2x * 368x - 368 * (x^2 + 17) + 2x * 33856 = 0

736x^2 - 368x^2 - 6256 + 67712x = 0

(736x^2 - 368x^2) + 67712x - 6256 = 0

368x^2 + 67712x - 6256 = 0

Divide entire equation by 8:

46x^2 + 8464x - 782 = 0

Use quadratic formula:

x = [-8464 ± sqrt(8464^2 - 4*46*(-782))]/(2*46)

Calculate discriminant:

8464^2 = 71641536

4*46*782 = 143872

Discriminant = 71641536 + 143872 = 71785408

sqrt(71785408) ≈ 8472.6

So,

x = [-8464 ± 8472.6]/92

Two solutions:

x1 = (-8464 + 8472.6)/92 ≈ 8.6/92 ≈ 0.0935

x2 = (-8464 - 8472.6)/92 ≈ -16936.6/92 ≈ -184.07

Since E is between D(0,16) and C(107,16), and E lies on y=16, x should be between 0 and 107 + 184 = 291, so x = 0.0935 is reasonable.

So E is at (0.0935,16).

C is at (107,16).

Therefore, length CE = 107 - 0.0935 ≈ 106.9065.

Since the problem likely expects an exact answer, let&#39;s express CE exactly.

Recall that x ≈ 0.0935, which is (approximately) the positive root of the quadratic:

46x^2 + 8464x - 782 = 0

We can write CE = 107 - x.

Alternatively, since the problem gives integer sides, the answer is approximately 107 - 0.0935 = 106.9065.

Rounding to the nearest integer, CE ≈ 107.

But since x is small, CE is close to 107.

So the length of CE is approximately 107 - 0.0935 = 106.9065, which is about 107.

Therefore, CE = 107 - x ≈ 107 - 0.0935 = 106.9065.

Answer: 106.9065 (approx).

If an exact simplified form is needed, CE = 107 - x where x is the positive root of 46x^2 + 8464x - 782 = 0.

But since the problem likely expects an integer, the answer is 107 - 0 = 107 approximately, but with the correction, it&#39;s about 107 - 0.0935 = 106.9.

Hence, the length of CE is approximately 107 - 0.0935 = 106.9.

Final answer: 106.9 (rounded to one decimal place).
