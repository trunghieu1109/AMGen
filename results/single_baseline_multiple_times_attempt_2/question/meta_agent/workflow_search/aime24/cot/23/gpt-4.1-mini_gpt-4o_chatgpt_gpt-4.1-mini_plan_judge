Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom equals 99. Let's denote the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The conditions are: \[ (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 \] \[ (a + d) = 9, (b + e) = 9, (c + f) = 9 \] From the second set of equations, we know that each column sum must be 9. We can solve for each pair (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f) individually. For each pair, there are 10 possible combinations: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0). Therefore, there are 10 choices for (a, d), 10 choices for (b, e), and 10 choices for (c, f). Thus, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 10 * 10 * 10.
