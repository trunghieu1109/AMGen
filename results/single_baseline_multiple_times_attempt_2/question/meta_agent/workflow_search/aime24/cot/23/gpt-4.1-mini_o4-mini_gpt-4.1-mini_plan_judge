Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let the grid entries be
 a b c
 d e f
Equation (1): 100a+10b+c + (100d+10e+f) = 999 ⇒ 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999 ⇒ a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9.
Equation (2): (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 ⇒ 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99.  From a+d=9 etc, d+e+f =27−(a+b+c). Sub into (2): 10S1 + (27−S1)=99 ⇒ 9S1=72 ⇒ S1=a+b+c=8. Then d+e+f=19 and (2) holds. 
Thus we need number of (a,b,c)∈{0..9}^3 with sum 8.  No upper‐bound issues since 8<9. The count is C(8+3−1 choose 3−1)=C(10,2)=45.
