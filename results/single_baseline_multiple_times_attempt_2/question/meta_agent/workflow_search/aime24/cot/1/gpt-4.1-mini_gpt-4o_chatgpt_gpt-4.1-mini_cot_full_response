Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent J6PU', content='To solve this problem, we will use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. First, note that the tangents from a point outside a circle to the circle are equal, so we have DB = DC. Let DB = DC = x. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have DA^2 = DB^2 = DC^2. Therefore, DA^2 = x^2.\n\nNow, consider the Power of a Point theorem applied to point D with respect to the circle. We have DA * DP = DB^2. Since DB = DC = x, we have DA * DP = x^2.\n\nWe are given that triangle ABC has sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We can use the fact that angle ADB = angle ADC = 90 degrees because AD is a diameter of circle Ï‰ (since it is the radical axis of the circle with tangents at B and C). Therefore, triangle ABD and triangle ACD are both right triangles.\n\nNow, we need to find AP. Since AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P, and D is the intersection of the tangents, we can use the Power of a Point theorem:\n\nDA * DP = DB^2 = x^2.\n\nTo find the length of AP, we can use a known result from geometry: in a triangle inscribed in a circle, if the tangents from B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects the circle again at P, then AP is given by the formula:\n\nAP = \\frac{AB \\cdot AC}{AB + AC}.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n\nAP = \\frac{5 \\cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \\frac{50}{15} = \\frac{10}{3}.\n\nThus, AP = \\frac{10}{3}, and m + n = 10 + 3 = 13.\n\nAnswer:13', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
