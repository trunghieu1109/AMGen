Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we will use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. First, note that the tangents from a point outside a circle to the circle are equal, so we have DB = DC. Let DB = DC = x. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have DA^2 = DB^2 = DC^2. Therefore, DA^2 = x^2.

Now, consider the Power of a Point theorem applied to point D with respect to the circle. We have DA * DP = DB^2. Since DB = DC = x, we have DA * DP = x^2.

We are given that triangle ABC has sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We can use the fact that angle ADB = angle ADC = 90 degrees because AD is a diameter of circle Ï‰ (since it is the radical axis of the circle with tangents at B and C). Therefore, triangle ABD and triangle ACD are both right triangles.

Now, we need to find AP. Since AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P, and D is the intersection of the tangents, we can use the Power of a Point theorem:

DA * DP = DB^2 = x^2.

To find the length of AP, we can use a known result from geometry: in a triangle inscribed in a circle, if the tangents from B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects the circle again at P, then AP is given by the formula:

AP = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC}.

Substituting the given values, we have:

AP = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = \frac{10}{3}.

Thus, AP = \frac{10}{3}, and m + n = 10 + 3 = 13.
