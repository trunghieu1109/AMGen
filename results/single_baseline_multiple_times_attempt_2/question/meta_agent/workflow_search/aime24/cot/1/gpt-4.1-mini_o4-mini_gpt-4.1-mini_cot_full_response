Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gmG7', content='We need to find AP where P is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.  A-known fact is that AD is the A–symmedian, so P is the symmedian point on the circle.  One way is to place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), solve for A via distance AB=5, AC=10 giving A=(1/3, 4√14/3).  The A-symmedian meets BC at K with BK/CK=AB^2/AC^2=25/100=1/4, so K=(1.8,0).  Parametrize line AK:  X=1/3 + t*(22/15), Y=4√14/3*(1–t).  The circumcircle has equation x^2+y^2–9x–(33/(2√14))y=0.  Substituting the line into the circle gives a quadratic in t with roots t=0 (point A) and t=250/169 (point P).  The distance AK vector length is |K–A|=26/5, so AP= t*(26/5) = (250/169)*(26/5) =100/13.  Hence m=100, n=13, m+n=113.\n\nAnswer:113', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
