    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

    <pre>Given triangle ABC inscribed in circle ω, with tangents at B and C intersecting at D, and line AD intersecting ω again at P. We know AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. We want to find AP in simplest fraction form.

Step 1: Use the property of tangents and power of a point.
Point D is the intersection of tangents at B and C. Since D lies outside the circle, the power of point D with respect to ω is:

DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP

Step 2: Find lengths DB and DC.
Since D is intersection of tangents at B and C, DB=DC.

Step 3: Use the fact that the triangle is inscribed in circle ω.
We can find the circumradius R using the sides.

Sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.
Use Law of Cosines to find angle B or C.

Step 4: Find circumradius R.
Area of triangle ABC using Heron&#39;s formula:

s = (5+9+10)/2 = 12
Area = sqrt(12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(504) = 2*sqrt(126)

Then, R = (abc)/(4*Area) = (5*9*10)/(4*2*sqrt(126)) = 450/(8*sqrt(126)) = 56.25 / sqrt(126)

Step 5: Use the fact that D is intersection of tangents at B and C, so D lies on the polar of A with respect to the circle.
Using the tangent lengths, DB=DC = length of tangent from D to circle.

Step 6: Use power of point A with respect to D:
DA * DP = DB^2
We want AP = length from A to P on the circle.

Step 7: Using the chord length and properties, find AP.
Alternatively, use the formula:
AP = (AB * AC) / BC
This is a known property when D is the intersection of tangents at B and C and P is the second intersection of line AD with the circle.

Calculate AP = (AB * AC) / BC = (5 * 10) / 9 = 50 / 9

Step 8: m=50, n=9, relatively prime.

Sum m + n = 50 + 9 = 59
