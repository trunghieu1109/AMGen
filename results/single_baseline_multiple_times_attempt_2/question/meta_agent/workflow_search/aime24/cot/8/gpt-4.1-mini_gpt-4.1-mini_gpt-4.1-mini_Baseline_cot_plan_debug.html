    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

    <pre>We analyze the game where two players take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. This means we want to find all n for which the starting position is a losing position for Alice (the first player). 

Let&#39;s define a position as losing if the player to move cannot force a win, and winning if the player to move can force a win.

We denote by L the losing positions and by W the winning positions.

- Base case: n=0 (no tokens left) is losing for the player to move because they cannot move.

For n &gt; 0, the position is winning if there is at least one move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) that leads to a losing position for the opponent. Otherwise, it is losing.

Let&#39;s compute the first few values:

n=0: L (by definition)

n=1: moves -&gt; remove 1 -&gt; n=0 (L), so n=1 is W
n=2: moves -&gt; remove 1 -&gt; n=1 (W), remove 4 (not possible), so no move leads to L, so n=2 is L
n=3: moves -&gt; remove 1 -&gt; n=2 (L), so n=3 is W
n=4: moves -&gt; remove 1 -&gt; n=3 (W), remove 4 -&gt; n=0 (L), so n=4 is W
n=5: moves -&gt; remove 1 -&gt; n=4 (W), remove 4 -&gt; n=1 (W), no move leads to L, so n=5 is L

From this pattern:
- n=0: L
- n=1: W
- n=2: L
- n=3: W
- n=4: W
- n=5: L

Let&#39;s continue a bit more to see the pattern:

n=6: remove 1 -&gt; n=5 (L) so W
n=7: remove 1 -&gt; n=6 (W), remove 4 -&gt; n=3 (W), no move leads to L, so L
n=8: remove 1 -&gt; n=7 (L) so W
n=9: remove 1 -&gt; n=8 (W), remove 4 -&gt; n=5 (L) so W
n=10: remove 1 -&gt; n=9 (W), remove 4 -&gt; n=6 (W), no move leads to L, so L

Positions losing for the player to move are at n=0,2,5,7,10.

Let&#39;s write these losing positions:
0,2,5,7,10

Check the differences:
2-0=2
5-2=3
7-5=2
10-7=3

Pattern in losing positions seems to be: starting from 0, the losing positions increase by 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, alternating.

Check next losing positions:
From 10, add 2 -&gt; 12
From 12, add 3 -&gt; 15
From 15, add 2 -&gt; 17
From 17, add 3 -&gt; 20

Check if these are losing positions:

n=12: remove 1 -&gt; 11 (?), remove 4 -&gt; 8 (?)
We need to check n=11 and n=8:

n=8: W (from above)
n=11: remove 1 -&gt; 10 (L), so n=11 is W

So from n=12:
remove 1 -&gt; 11 (W)
remove 4 -&gt; 8 (W)
No move leads to L, so n=12 is L

Similarly for n=15:
remove 1 -&gt; 14
remove 4 -&gt; 11
Check n=14:
remove 1 -&gt; 13
remove 4 -&gt; 10
Check n=13:
remove 1 -&gt; 12 (L), so n=13 is W
n=14:
remove 1 -&gt; 13 (W)
remove 4 -&gt; 10 (L), so n=14 is W

Back to n=15:
remove 1 -&gt; 14 (W)
remove 4 -&gt; 11 (W)
No move leads to L, so n=15 is L

This confirms the pattern.

So losing positions are:
0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...

The pattern is: start at 0, then add 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, alternating.

The sequence of losing positions can be expressed as:
L0 = 0
L1 = L0 + 2 = 2
L2 = L1 + 3 = 5
L3 = L2 + 2 = 7
L4 = L3 + 3 = 10
L5 = L4 + 2 = 12
L6 = L5 + 3 = 15
L7 = L6 + 2 = 17
L8 = L7 + 3 = 20
L9 = L8 + 2 = 22
and so on.

Group the sequence into pairs:
(0,2), (5,7), (10,12), (15,17), (20,22), ...

Each pair increases by 5 from the previous pair&#39;s first element:
0, 5, 10, 15, 20, ...

So the losing positions are all numbers of the form 5k or 5k+2 for k ≥ 0.

Check this:
For k=0: 0, 2
k=1: 5, 7
k=2: 10, 12
k=3: 15, 17
k=4: 20, 22
Yes, this matches the losing positions.

Since n&gt;0, the losing positions for the first player (Alice) are all n such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial n satisfies n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Now, count positive integers n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0:
Multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404

Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2:
Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are 2,7,12,...
The largest number ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5 is 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2).
Number of such numbers = floor((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405

Total losing positions for Alice (winning for Bob) = 404 + 405 = 809

Hence, for 809 values of n ≤ 2024, Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves.
