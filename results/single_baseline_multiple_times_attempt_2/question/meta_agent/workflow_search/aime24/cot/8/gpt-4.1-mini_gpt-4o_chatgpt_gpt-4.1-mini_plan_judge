Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the 'winning' and 'losing' positions in the game. A losing position is one where no matter what move the player makes, they cannot force a win, meaning the opponent can always respond in a way that leads to a win for them. Conversely, a winning position is one where the player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position. 

Let's analyze the positions:
1. If there is 1 token (n=1), Alice can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.
2. If there are 2 tokens (n=2), Alice can take 1 token (leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob) or 4 tokens (not possible). Thus, n=2 is a losing position for Alice.
3. If there are 3 tokens (n=3), Alice can take 1 token (leaving 2 tokens, a losing position for Bob) or 4 tokens (not possible). Thus, n=3 is a winning position for Alice.
4. If there are 4 tokens (n=4), Alice can take 4 tokens and win. Thus, n=4 is a winning position for Alice.
5. If there are 5 tokens (n=5), Alice can take 1 token (leaving 4 tokens, a winning position for Bob) or 4 tokens (leaving 1 token, a winning position for Bob). Thus, n=5 is a losing position for Alice.

We continue this process, observing the pattern that emerges:
- n = 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, ... are winning positions for Alice.
- n = 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, ... are losing positions for Alice and thus winning for Bob.

The losing positions (for Alice) are of the form n = 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, ..., which follow the pattern of numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 3.

To find how many such numbers are there up to 2024, we solve the inequality 3k + 2 <= 2024.

Solving for k, we get:
3k <= 2022
k <= 674

Thus, k ranges from 0 to 674, giving 675 possible values of k.

Therefore, there are 675 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
