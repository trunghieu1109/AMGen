Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lv8x', content='We set A=log2 x, B=log2 y, C=log2 z. Then the equations become: A−B−C=1/2, −A+B−C=1/3, −A−B+C=1/4. Summing gives −(A+B+C)=13/12 ⇒ A+B+C=−13/12. From the first, A=1/2+B+C ⇒ A=1/2−19/24=−7/24. From the second, B−C=1/3+A=1/3−7/24=1/24. Also B+C=−19/24. Solving yields B=−3/8, C=−5/12. Then log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)=4A+3B+2C=(−28−27−20)/24=−75/24=−25/8, so its absolute value is 25/8. Thus m+n=25+8=33.\n\nAnswer:33', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
