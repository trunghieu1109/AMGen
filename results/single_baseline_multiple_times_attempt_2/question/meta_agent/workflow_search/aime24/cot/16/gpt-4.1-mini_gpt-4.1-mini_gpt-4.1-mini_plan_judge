Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Given triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, and the conditions IA ⟂ OI, circumradius R = 13, and inradius r = 6. We want to find AB * AC.

Step 1: Assign notation. Let the sides be a = BC, b = AC, c = AB, and angles A, B, C opposite these sides.

Step 2: Use the given information. The circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6.

Step 3: The condition IA ⟂ OI means the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from O to I.

Step 4: Place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0) since it is the center of the circumcircle.

Step 5: Since O is at origin and circumradius is 13, the points A, B, C lie on the circle x² + y² = 169.

Step 6: Let’s place point A at (13,0) on the circle without loss of generality (since we can rotate the triangle).

Step 7: The incenter I lies inside the triangle. We have vectors:
OI = I - O = I
IA = A - I

Given IA ⟂ OI, so (A - I) · I = 0

Substitute A = (13,0), I = (x,y):
(13 - x, 0 - y) · (x, y) = 0
=> (13 - x)*x + (0 - y)*y = 0
=> 13x - x² - y² = 0
=> 13x = x² + y²

Step 8: Note that x² + y² = 13x

Step 9: The incenter I satisfies the formula for incenter coordinates in terms of side lengths:
I = ( (aA_x + bB_x + cC_x) / (a + b + c), (aA_y + bB_y + cC_y) / (a + b + c) )

Step 10: We want to find AB * AC = c * b.

Step 11: Use the formula for area and inradius:
Area = r * s, where s = (a + b + c)/2

Step 12: Use Law of Sines:
a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R = 26

Step 13: Since A is at (13,0), let’s parametrize B and C on the circle as:
B = (13 cos θ, 13 sin θ)
C = (13 cos φ, 13 sin φ)

Step 14: Side lengths:
AB = |A - B| = sqrt((13 - 13 cos θ)² + (0 - 13 sin θ)²) = 13 sqrt((1 - cos θ)² + sin² θ) = 13 sqrt(2 - 2 cos θ) = 13 * 2 sin(θ/2) = 26 sin(θ/2)

Similarly,
AC = |A - C| = 26 sin(φ/2)

Step 15: So AB * AC = 26 * 26 * sin(θ/2) * sin(φ/2) = 676 sin(θ/2) sin(φ/2)

Step 16: The incenter coordinates I = (x,y) = ( (a*13 + b*13 cos θ + c*13 cos φ) / (a + b + c), (0 + b*13 sin θ + c*13 sin φ) / (a + b + c) )

Step 17: Since a = BC, b = AC, c = AB, and from Law of Sines:
a = 26 sin A
b = 26 sin B
c = 26 sin C

Step 18: Angles sum to 180°, so A + B + C = 180°.

Step 19: Since A is at (13,0), angle A is fixed. Let's find angle A.

Step 20: Using the formula for inradius and circumradius:
r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Given r = 6, R = 13:
6 = 4*13*sin(A/2)*sin(B/2)*sin(C/2)
6 = 52 * sin(A/2)*sin(B/2)*sin(C/2)

So sin(A/2)*sin(B/2)*sin(C/2) = 6/52 = 3/26

Step 21: Also, from Step 15, AB*AC = 676 sin(θ/2) sin(φ/2) = 676 sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Step 22: From Step 20, sin(A/2) * sin(B/2) * sin(C/2) = 3/26

Step 23: From Step 7 and 8, x² + y² = 13x

Step 24: The incenter I is inside the triangle, so x > 0.

Step 25: The incenter lies on the line of symmetry if the triangle is isosceles at A, so assume b = c, so B and C are symmetric about x-axis.

Then,
B = (13 cos θ, 13 sin θ)
C = (13 cos θ, -13 sin θ)

Then,
AB = AC = 26 sin(θ/2)

Then,
AB * AC = (26 sin(θ/2))^2 = 676 sin²(θ/2)

Step 26: The incenter I is on the x-axis due to symmetry:
I = ( (a*13 + b*13 cos θ + c*13 cos θ) / (a + b + c), 0 )

Since b = c, and a = BC = distance between B and C = 2 * 13 sin θ = 26 sin θ

Also, b = c = 26 sin B = 26 sin C = 26 sin((180 - A)/2) = 26 sin((180 - A)/2)

But with isosceles at A, angles B = C = (180 - A)/2

Step 27: Using inradius formula:
r = 4R sin(A/2) sin²((180 - A)/4)

Given r=6, R=13:
6 = 4*13*sin(A/2)*sin²((180 - A)/4)

6/52 = sin(A/2)*sin²((180 - A)/4)
3/26 = sin(A/2)*sin²(90 - A/4) = sin(A/2)*cos²(A/4)

Step 28: Let’s set x = A/2 in degrees.

Then:
3/26 = sin x * cos²(x/2)

Step 29: Use identity cos²(x/2) = (1 + cos x)/2

So:
3/26 = sin x * (1 + cos x)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:
6/26 = sin x * (1 + cos x)
3/13 = sin x * (1 + cos x)

Step 30: Let’s solve for sin x * (1 + cos x) = 3/13

Try to find x numerically:

Try x = 30°:
sin 30° = 0.5, cos 30° = 0.866
sin x * (1 + cos x) = 0.5 * (1 + 0.866) = 0.5 * 1.866 = 0.933 > 3/13 ≈ 0.2307

Try x = 15°:
sin 15° = 0.2588, cos 15° = 0.9659
Value = 0.2588 * (1 + 0.9659) = 0.2588 * 1.9659 ≈ 0.5087 > 0.2307

Try x = 7.5°:
sin 7.5° = 0.1305, cos 7.5° = 0.9914
Value = 0.1305 * (1 + 0.9914) = 0.1305 * 1.9914 = 0.2599 > 0.2307

Try x = 5°:
sin 5° = 0.0872, cos 5° = 0.9962
Value = 0.0872 * (1 + 0.9962) = 0.0872 * 1.9962 = 0.174 > 0.2307 (too low)

Try x = 6°:
sin 6°=0.1045, cos 6°=0.9945
Value=0.1045*(1+0.9945)=0.1045*1.9945=0.2085 <0.2307

Try x=7°:
sin 7°=0.1219, cos 7°=0.9925
Value=0.1219*(1+0.9925)=0.1219*1.9925=0.2429 >0.2307

Interpolate between 6° and 7°:
At 6°, 0.2085; at 7°, 0.2429; target 0.2307
Difference between 6° and target: 0.2307 - 0.2085 = 0.0222
Difference between 7° and 6°: 0.2429 - 0.2085 = 0.0344
Fraction = 0.0222 / 0.0344 ≈ 0.645

So x ≈ 6° + 0.645° = 6.645°

Step 31: So A/2 ≈ 6.645°, A ≈ 13.29°

Step 32: Then sin(A/2) = sin 6.645° ≈ 0.1157

Step 33: AB * AC = 676 sin²(θ/2) = 676 sin²(B/2) since B = C = (180 - A)/2 = (180 - 13.29)/2 = 83.355°

So B/2 = 41.6775°

sin(B/2) = sin 41.6775° ≈ 0.664

Therefore,
AB * AC = 676 * (0.664)² = 676 * 0.441 = approx 298.3

Step 34: Since the problem likely expects an integer, answer is 298.

Hence, AB * AC = 298.
