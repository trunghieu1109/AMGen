Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I, with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. We need to find AB * AC.

The condition IA ⊥ OI implies that A lies on the circle with diameter OI. This is a special case where the triangle is tangential to the nine-point circle, and we can use the fact that R = 2r + d, where d is the distance from the incenter to the circumcenter.

We know R = 13 and r = 6. So, 13 = 2(6) + d, giving d = 1.

In a triangle with IA ⊥ OI, the formula AB * AC = c(R^2 - d^2) can be used, where c is the side opposite A.

We calculate AB * AC = c(13^2 - 1^2) = c(169 - 1) = c(168).

Since AB * AC is given by 2Rr, we also have AB * AC = 2 * 13 * 6 = 156.

Thus, AB * AC = 156.
