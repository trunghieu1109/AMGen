Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gx2v', content='We have triangle ABC with circumradius R=13, inradius r=6. The distance OI satisfies OI^2=R(R−2r)=13, and since IA⊥OI, IA^2=OA^2−OI^2=169−13=156. But IA=r/sin(A/2), so sin^2(A/2)=r^2/IA^2=36/156=3/13. Hence sinA=2sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2√(3/13)√(10/13)=2√30/13, giving a=BC=2RsinA=26·(2√30/13)=4√30.\n\nWe want bc. Using Δ=rs and Δ=½bc sinA gives bc=2rs/sinA=12s/( (2√30)/13 )=78s/√30, where s=(a+b+c)/2=(4√30+x)/2 with x=b+c. Thus bc=156+(39/√30)x.\n\nAlso use identity a^2+b^2+c^2=2(s^2−r^2−4Rr) to get a relation for x=b+c. After algebra one finds x=(396±84)/(2√30), giving two positive possibilities x=8√30 or x=26√30/5. Only x=8√30 yields bc integer: bc=156+39·8=468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
