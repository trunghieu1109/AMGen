proposed answer: We want to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We start by analyzing the condition n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). This implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). First, check small primes.

For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ 3 (mod 4), but n^4 is either 0 or 1 mod 4, so no n satisfies this.

For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 8 (mod 9). Check n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8:
- n = 0: 0^4 ≡ 0 (mod 9)
- n = 1: 1^4 ≡ 1 (mod 9)
- n = 2: 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
- n = 3: 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 0 (mod 9)
- n = 4: 4^4 ≡ 256 ≡ 4 (mod 9)
- n = 5: 5^4 ≡ 625 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
- n = 6: 6^4 ≡ 1296 ≡ 0 (mod 9)
- n = 7: 7^4 ≡ 2401 ≡ 4 (mod 9)
- n = 8: 8^4 ≡ 4096 ≡ 1 (mod 9)
None of these satisfy n^4 ≡ 8 (mod 9), so p = 3 doesn't work.

For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 24 (mod 25). Check n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 24:
- n = 0: 0^4 ≡ 0 (mod 25)
- n = 1: 1^4 ≡ 1 (mod 25)
- n = 2: 2^4 ≡ 16 (mod 25)
- n = 3: 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 6 (mod 25)
- n = 4: 4^4 ≡ 256 ≡ 6 (mod 25)
- n = 5: 5^4 ≡ 625 ≡ 0 (mod 25)
- n = 6: 6^4 ≡ 1296 ≡ 1 (mod 25)
- n = 7: 7^4 ≡ 2401 ≡ 24 (mod 25)

n = 7 works, so p = 5 is the smallest prime that works. Now find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2.

Since n = 7 works, m = 7 is the smallest positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2.
