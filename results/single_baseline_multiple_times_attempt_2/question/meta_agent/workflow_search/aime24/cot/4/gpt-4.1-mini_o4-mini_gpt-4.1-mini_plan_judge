Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We seek the smallest prime p for which there is n with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2. Test p≡1 mod4: p=5 fails (no n^4≡−1 mod5), p=13 fails (quartic residues mod13 are {0,1,3,9}), next p=17 works since 2^4≡−1 mod17 and 4·2^3≡0 mod17 so Hensel lift fails for n≡2, but roots n≡8,9,15 mod17 have f′(n) invertible mod17; they each lift uniquely to mod289. Lifting for n0=8 gives the smallest positive root n=110 mod289. Hence p=17 and m=110.
