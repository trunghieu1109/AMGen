Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To find the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we first need to understand what it means for an integer n to be b-beautiful. A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = ab + c, where 0 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b, and a > 0 (since it must have two digits). Additionally, a + c = sqrt(n), which implies that a + c must be a perfect square, say k^2. Therefore, we have n = (a * b + c) and a + c = k^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 such integers n. For each b, we iterate over possible values of a and c, calculate n, and check if a + c is a perfect square. We count the number of such n for each b and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.
