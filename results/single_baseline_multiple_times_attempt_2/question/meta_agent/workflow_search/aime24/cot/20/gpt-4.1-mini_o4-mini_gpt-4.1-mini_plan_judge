Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We seek b ≥2 s.t. the count of b‐eautiful integers exceeds 10. A positive integer n is b‐eautiful if n=k^2 is two‐digit in base b (so b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2−1 hence k in [ceil(√b), b−1]) and its base‐b digits x,y satisfy x+y=k. Writing n=xb+y gives k^2 = xb+y and x+y=k ⇒ x(b−1)=k(k−1), so b−1 divides k(k−1). Let m=b−1. Solutions k mod m to m|k(k−1) are those k≡0 or 1 mod each prime factor of m, giving 2^ω(m) roots in 1…m. The number of b‐eautifuls is the number of such k in [ceil(√b), b−1], i.e. 2^ω(m) minus those small k<ceil(√(m+1)). To exceed 10 we need ω(m)≥4 so 2^ω(m)=16 and subtracting few small roots still leaves >10. The smallest m with ω(m)=4 is 2·3·5·7=210 so b=m+1=211, giving 16−1=15 >10. No smaller b works.
