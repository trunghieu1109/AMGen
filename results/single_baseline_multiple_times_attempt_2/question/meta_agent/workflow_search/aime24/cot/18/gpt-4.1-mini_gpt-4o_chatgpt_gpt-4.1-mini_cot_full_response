Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6mfn', content='To solve the problem, we first parameterize the line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) using a parameter \\(t\\) such that \\(A = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)\\) corresponds to \\(t = 0\\) and \\(B = \\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\) corresponds to \\(t = 1\\). The point \\(C\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is given by \\(C(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)\\). We need to find the point \\(C\\) such that it does not lie on any segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) except for \\(\\overline{AB}\\). A segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with \\(P = (x, 0)\\) and \\(Q = (0, y)\\) must satisfy \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\). For \\(C(t)\\) to be on \\(\\overline{PQ}\\), we need \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)^2 = 1\\). Simplifying, we get \\(\\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\\). This simplifies to \\(1 - t + t^2 = 1\\), leading to \\(t(t-1) = 0\\). Since \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\) correspond to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively, the only remaining solution is \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Substituting \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\) into the parameterization of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), we find \\(C = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)\\). Finally, we calculate \\(OC^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Thus, \\(OC^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\), where \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 4\\), giving \\(p + q = 5\\).\n\nAnswer:5', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
