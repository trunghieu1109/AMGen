Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first parameterize the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) using a parameter \(t\) such that \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) corresponds to \(t = 0\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) corresponds to \(t = 1\). The point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) is given by \(C(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\). We need to find the point \(C\) such that it does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except for \(\overline{AB}\). A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P = (x, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y)\) must satisfy \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). For \(C(t)\) to be on \(\overline{PQ}\), we need \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = 1\). Simplifying, we get \(\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\). This simplifies to \(1 - t + t^2 = 1\), leading to \(t(t-1) = 0\). Since \(t = 0\) and \(t = 1\) correspond to \(A\) and \(B\), respectively, the only remaining solution is \(t = \frac{1}{2}\). Substituting \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) into the parameterization of \(\overline{AB}\), we find \(C = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). Finally, we calculate \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{1}{4}\). Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), where \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), giving \(p + q = 5\).
