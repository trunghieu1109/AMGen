Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent miZM', content='We parameterize points C on AB by C=((1–t)/2, t√3/2). A given segment PQ with P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0, sinθ) passes through C iff f(θ)=C.x/ cosθ + C.y/ sinθ =1.  Since C lies on AB, f(π/3)=1 for all t.  To ensure no other θ solves f(θ)=1, we need θ=π/3 to be the unique minimum of f, so f′(π/3)=0.  Writing f(θ)=A secθ + B cscθ with A=(1–t)/2, B=(t√3)/2, we get f′(θ)=A secθ tanθ – B cscθ cotθ, and f′(π/3)=0 ⇒ t=3/4.  Thus C=(1/8,3√3/8) and OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, giving p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
