Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6Md9', content="The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus surface and on the sphere surface. \n\nThe torus is defined by points at a distance r = 3 from the circle of radius R = 6 in the xy-plane. The center of the torus is at the origin. The sphere has radius 11 and is centered somewhere such that the torus is tangent externally to it.\n\nWe want to find the radii r_i and r_o of the circles of tangency when the torus rests on the sphere in two different ways (internally and externally tangent), and then find the difference r_i - r_o.\n\nStep 1: Understand the torus geometry.\n- The torus can be parametrized as (R + r cos θ, r sin θ) in the cross-sectional plane.\n- The circle of revolution has radius R = 6.\n- The tube radius is r = 3.\n\nStep 2: The sphere has radius 11.\n\nStep 3: When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the circle of tangency lies at some distance from the center. The torus' center circle has radius 6, and the tube radius is 3.\n\nStep 4: The torus' surface points have distance from the z-axis in the range [R - r, R + r] = [3, 9].\n\nStep 5: The sphere has radius 11, so it is larger than the torus.\n\nStep 6: The torus can rest on the sphere in two ways, producing two circles of tangency with radii r_i and r_o on the torus. These correspond to the inner and outer circles of the torus tube.\n\nStep 7: The radii of the circles of tangency correspond to the distance from the z-axis where the torus touches the sphere.\n\nStep 8: The torus tube circles have radii R ± r = 6 ± 3 = 9 (outer circle) and 3 (inner circle).\n\nStep 9: The sphere with radius 11 is tangent to the torus at some circle. The distance from the z-axis to the circle of tangency is d.\n\nStep 10: The distance from the sphere center to the circle of tangency is 11 (sphere radius).\n\nStep 11: The torus circle of revolution is at distance 6 from the axis, and the tube radius is 3, so the torus surface is at radius 9 (outer) and 3 (inner).\n\nStep 12: The torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and internally tangent along a circle with radius r_o.\n\nStep 13: The difference r_i - r_o is what we want.\n\nStep 14: Since the torus is tangent along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is equal to the sphere radius plus or minus the tube radius, depending on the configuration.\n\nStep 15: The circle of tangency radius on the torus is either R - r = 3 (inner circle) or R + r = 9 (outer circle).\n\nStep 16: The difference is 9 - 3 = 6.\n\nStep 17: But the problem states the difference r_i - r_o can be expressed as m/n, so let's verify carefully.\n\nStep 18: The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle with radius r_i, and internally along a circle with radius r_o.\n\nStep 19: The circle radii on the torus are R ± r = 9 and 3.\n\nStep 20: The difference is 9 - 3 = 6, so the difference r_i - r_o = 6.\n\nStep 21: So m = 6, n = 1, and m + n = 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.\n\nAnswer:7", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
