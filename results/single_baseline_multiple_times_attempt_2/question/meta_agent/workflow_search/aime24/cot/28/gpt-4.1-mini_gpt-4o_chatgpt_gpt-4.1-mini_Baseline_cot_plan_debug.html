    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve the problem, we start by understanding the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 11 + 3 = 14 when the torus is resting on the sphere (internally tangent), and 11 - 3 = 8 when the torus is resting under the sphere (externally tangent).

The center of the torus&#39;s tube is at a distance of 6 from the center of the torus. Therefore, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus is at a distance of 14 - 6 = 8 from the center of the sphere, and when it is internally tangent, the center of the torus is at a distance of 8 - 6 = 2 from the center of the sphere.

However, we need to find the radii of the circles of tangency, which are the distances from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency on the torus. For the external tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency r_o is 2, and for the internal tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency r_i is 8. The difference r_i - r_o is 8 - 2 = 6.

The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o to be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) where m and n are relatively prime integers, and then find m + n. Since 6 can be expressed as \( \frac{6}{1} \), where 6 and 1 are relatively prime, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 7.
