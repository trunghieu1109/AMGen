    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We place the torus (major radius 6, minor radius 3) with its axis vertical and center of its generating circle at height h above the sphere’s center.  A point on the torus is
P=(6+3cosφ)e_r+(h+3sinφ)e_z.
At tangency to the sphere of radius 11 we require the torus normal (direction from its generating‐circle center to P) to align with the sphere normal (direction OP).  This leads to (6+3cosφ)/11=s cosφ and (h+3sinφ)/11=s sinφ with s=±1.

Case s=+1 ⇒ cosφ=6/8=3/4 ⇒ r_o=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.
Case s=–1 ⇒ cosφ=6/(–14)=–3/7 ⇒ r_i=6+3·(–3/7)=33/7.

Thus r_i–r_o=33/7–33/4=33·(4–7)/28=−99/28, so the positive difference is 99/28.  Hence m+n=99+28=127.
