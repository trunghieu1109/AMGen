proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Let's solve each equation step by step. 

For the first equation, \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \), we can rewrite this in exponential form as \( y^x = x^{10} \). 

For the second equation, \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we can rewrite this in exponential form as \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \).

Now we have two equations: 
1. \( y^x = x^{10} \)
2. \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \)

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides of each equation, we get:

From the first equation: \( x \log_{10} y = 10 \log_{10} x \).
From the second equation: \( 4y \log_{10} x = 10 \log_{10} y \).

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously. 

From the first equation, \( x \log_{10} y = 10 \log_{10} x \), we can express \( \log_{10} y \) in terms of \( \log_{10} x \): 
\[ \log_{10} y = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10} x. \]

From the second equation, \( 4y \log_{10} x = 10 \log_{10} y \), we can express \( \log_{10} x \) in terms of \( \log_{10} y \):
\[ \log_{10} x = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10} y = \frac{5}{2y} \log_{10} y. \]

Substitute \( \log_{10} y = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10} x \) into the expression for \( \log_{10} x \):
\[ \log_{10} x = \frac{5}{2y} \left( \frac{10}{x} \log_{10} x \right) = \frac{50}{2xy} \log_{10} x. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \log_{10} x = \frac{25}{xy} \log_{10} x. \]

If \( \log_{10} x \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( \log_{10} x \):
\[ 1 = \frac{25}{xy}. \]

Thus, \( xy = 25 \).
