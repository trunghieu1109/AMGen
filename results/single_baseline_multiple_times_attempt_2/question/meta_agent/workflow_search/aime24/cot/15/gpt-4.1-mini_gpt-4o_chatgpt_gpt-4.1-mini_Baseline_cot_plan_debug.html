    <pre>We are given a total of 900 residents, with each owning a bag of candy hearts. We also have information on how many own diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. We need to find how many own all four items. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let D, G, and S represent the sets of residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades, respectively. We know |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562. The total owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. We seek the number owning all four items, denoted as x. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets is: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234. We also have |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 437 + 2 * 234 = 905, since each of the 234 residents owning three items is counted three times in the two-item owners. Thus, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 905 + 234 = 453. Since each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the total number of residents owning any of the four items (including candy hearts) is 900. Therefore, the number owning all four items is 900 - 453 = 447.
