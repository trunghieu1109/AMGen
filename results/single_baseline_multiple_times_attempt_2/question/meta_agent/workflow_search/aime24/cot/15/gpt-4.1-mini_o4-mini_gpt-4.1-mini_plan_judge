Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We note that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so the problem reduces to three sets: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Let x0,x1,x2,x3 be the numbers of residents owning exactly 0,1,2,3 of these three items. We have x1=437, x2=234, x0+x1+x2+x3=900, and the sum of memberships 195+367+562=1124 equals 1·x1+2·x2+3·x3=437+468+3x3=905+3x3. Hence 1124=905+3x3 ⇒ x3=73. Those x3 residents own all three items plus candy hearts, so 73 own all four.
