    <pre>Let the four items be Diamond ring (D), Golf clubs (G), Garden spade (S), and Candy hearts (C). We know: Total residents (T) = 900; |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, and |C|=900 (since everyone owns candy hearts). Number of residents owning exactly two items = 437, exactly three items = 234. We want to find the number owning all four items (D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning 1 item means owning candy hearts plus one other item, owning 2 items means candy hearts plus two others, etc. Let&#39;s denote: x = number of residents owning all four items. Then, the number owning exactly 3 items (which includes candy hearts and exactly two others) is 234, and exactly 2 items (candy hearts + exactly one other) is 437. Also, the number owning exactly 1 item (only candy hearts) is T - (number owning exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4) = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x. Now, sum of owners of each item: 195 (D), 367 (G), 562 (S), 900 (C). The total number of item ownerships is 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. On the other hand, total item ownerships can be counted as: (number owning exactly 1 item)*1 + (number owning exactly 2 items)*2 + (number owning exactly 3 items)*3 + (number owning exactly 4 items)*4 = (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4 = 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 1805 + 3x. Setting equal: 1805 + 3x = 2024 =&gt; 3x = 219 =&gt; x = 73. So, 73 residents own all four items.
