Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Let the four items be Diamond ring (D), Golf clubs (G), Garden spade (S), and Candy hearts (C). We know: Total residents (T) = 900; |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, and |C|=900 (since everyone owns candy hearts). Number of residents owning exactly two items = 437, exactly three items = 234. We want to find the number owning all four items (D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning 1 item means owning candy hearts plus one other item, owning 2 items means candy hearts plus two others, etc. Let's denote: x = number of residents owning all four items. Then, the number owning exactly 3 items (which includes candy hearts and exactly two others) is 234, and exactly 2 items (candy hearts + exactly one other) is 437. Also, the number owning exactly 1 item (only candy hearts) is T - (number owning exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4) = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x. Now, sum of owners of each item: 195 (D), 367 (G), 562 (S), 900 (C). The total number of item ownerships is 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. On the other hand, total item ownerships can be counted as: (number owning exactly 1 item)*1 + (number owning exactly 2 items)*2 + (number owning exactly 3 items)*3 + (number owning exactly 4 items)*4 = (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4 = 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 1805 + 3x. Setting equal: 1805 + 3x = 2024 => 3x = 219 => x = 73. So, 73 residents own all four items.
