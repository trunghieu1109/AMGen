Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QOIy', content='We have hyperbola x^2/20−y^2/24=1 and want rhombi ABCD with center O, so C=−A, D=−B, and side lengths equal gives A·B=0. The diagonal BD goes from B to D=−B so BD^2=4|B|^2. Parametrize B by x=a sec\u2009t, y=b\u2009tan\u2009t with a^2=20,b^2=24. Then |B|^2=20+44\u2009tan^2t and BD^2=4(20+44\u2009tan^2t)=80+176\u2009tan^2t. The perpendicular line through O must intersect the hyperbola, which holds exactly when |sin\u2009t|>5/6. On that domain tan^2t≥(25/11) so BD^2≥80+176*(25/11)=480. As t approaches the boundary the infimum 480 is approached but not attained, so the greatest real less than all BD^2 is 480.\n\nAnswer:480', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
