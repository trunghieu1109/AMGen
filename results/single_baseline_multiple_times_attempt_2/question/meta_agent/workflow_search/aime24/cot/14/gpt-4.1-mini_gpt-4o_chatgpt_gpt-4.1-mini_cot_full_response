Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZUEv', content='The given hyperbola is centered at the origin with semi-major axis along the x-axis and semi-minor axis along the y-axis. The equation is \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\). For a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the points \\( A, B, C, D \\) can be placed symmetrically with respect to the origin. If \\( A = (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( C = (-x_1, -y_1) \\), then \\( B = (x_2, y_2) \\) and \\( D = (-x_2, -y_2) \\). The diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin. The length of diagonal \\( AC \\) is \\( 2\\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \\) and the length of diagonal \\( BD \\) is \\( 2\\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \\). For a rhombus, \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are equal, so \\( x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\). The points must satisfy the hyperbola equation: \\( \\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \\frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \\) and \\( \\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \\frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \\). To maximize \\( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \\), we maximize \\( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\) subject to these constraints. Substituting \\( x_2^2 = 20 + \\frac{20}{24}y_2^2 \\) into \\( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\), we find the maximum value for \\( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\).\n\nAnswer:80', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
