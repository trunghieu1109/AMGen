Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The given hyperbola is centered at the origin with semi-major axis along the x-axis and semi-minor axis along the y-axis. The equation is \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). For a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the points \( A, B, C, D \) can be placed symmetrically with respect to the origin. If \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( C = (-x_1, -y_1) \), then \( B = (x_2, y_2) \) and \( D = (-x_2, -y_2) \). The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin. The length of diagonal \( AC \) is \( 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \) and the length of diagonal \( BD \) is \( 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \). For a rhombus, \( AC \) and \( BD \) are equal, so \( x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2 \). The points must satisfy the hyperbola equation: \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). To maximize \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \), we maximize \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \) subject to these constraints. Substituting \( x_2^2 = 20 + \frac{20}{24}y_2^2 \) into \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \), we find the maximum value for \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \).
