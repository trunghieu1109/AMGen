    <pre>Let A be the set chosen by Alice, consisting of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We want to find the sum of the elements of A given that the number of such sets B is 2024.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
Each set B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and max(B) is in A.

Step 2: Count the number of sets B for a given A.
For each a in A, consider all finite nonempty sets B with max(B) = a.

Step 3: Count the number of sets B with max(B) = a.
Such a set B must contain the element a, and all other elements are positive integers less than a.
The elements less than a can be chosen arbitrarily (any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}).

Number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^(a-1).
Each subset combined with {a} forms a unique set B with max(B) = a.

Therefore, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1).

Step 4: Total number of sets B with max(B) in A is the sum over a in A of 2^(a-1).

Given that this sum equals 2024:
Sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024.

Step 5: Express 2024 in terms of powers of two.
Let&#39;s find the binary representation of 2024.

2024 in binary:
2024 / 2 = 1012 remainder 0
1012 / 2 = 506 remainder 0
506 / 2 = 253 remainder 0
253 / 2 = 126 remainder 1
126 / 2 = 63 remainder 0
63 / 2 = 31 remainder 1
31 / 2 = 15 remainder 1
15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1
7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1
3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

Reading remainders from bottom to top: 111111001000

So 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3

Step 6: Convert powers of two to the form 2^(a-1).
We have:
2^(10) = 2^(a-1) =&gt; a-1 = 10 =&gt; a = 11
2^(9) =&gt; a = 10
2^(8) =&gt; a = 9
2^(7) =&gt; a = 8
2^(6) =&gt; a = 7
2^(5) =&gt; a = 6
2^(3) =&gt; a = 4

So A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.

Step 7: Find the sum of elements of A.
Sum = 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.

Answer: 55.
