Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let A={a1,…,ak}. For each a in A, the number of nonempty finite B with max(B)=a is 2^{a-1} (choose any subset of {1,…,a-1}). Thus Sum_{a in A}2^{a-1}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024=11111101000_2 =2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Hence A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Sum is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.
