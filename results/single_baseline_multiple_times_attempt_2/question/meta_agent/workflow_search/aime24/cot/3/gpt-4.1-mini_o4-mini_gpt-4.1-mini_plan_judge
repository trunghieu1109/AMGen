Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: We seek intersection points (x,y) satisfying y=U(x)=4\,|\,|\,|sin2\pi x| - 1/2| - 1/4| and x=V(y)=4\,|\,|\,|cos3\pi y| - 1/2| - 1/4|.  Both U(x) and V(y) oscillate piecewise and have simple periodic sawtooth shapes: U has period 0.5 on x\in[0,1] with 8 monotonic segments, and V has period 1/3 on y\in[0,1] with 12 monotonic segments but for intersection count only the 4 critical y-levels (y=0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1) matter as breakpoints.  Thus composing F(x)=V(U(x)), we get F continuous on [0,1], piecewise on 8 U-segments further cut at U(x)=these 5 critical y-levels into 8*5=40 monotonic subintervals.  On each, F(x)−x is monotonic, so can cross 0 at most once, giving at most 40 roots; we check endpoints F(0)−0=1>0 and F(1)−1=0, so there are indeed 40 sign changes and hence 40 distinct solutions.  Therefore the graphs meet in 40 points.
