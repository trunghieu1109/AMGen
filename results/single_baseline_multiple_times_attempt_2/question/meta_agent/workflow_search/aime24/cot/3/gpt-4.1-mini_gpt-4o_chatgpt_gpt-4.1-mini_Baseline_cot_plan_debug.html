    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the number of intersections of the graphs of two functions: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). We&#39;ll start by analyzing the functions f and g. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a piecewise function with a V-shape centered at x = 0.5, with a minimum value of 0 at x = 0.5 and increasing linearly as x moves away from 0.5. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is also a V-shaped function centered at x = 0.25, with a minimum value of 0 at x = 0.25. The function h(x) = 4g(f(x)) will have a similar V-shape with a minimum value of 0 at x = 0.5, and will be 0 when f(x) = 0.25. Now, let&#39;s analyze the intersection condition: 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y. We need to find when these are simultaneously true. Start by considering the range of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which is [-1, 1]. For f(x) = 0, x must be 0.5 or -0.5, and for g(x) = 0, x must be 0.25 or -0.25. Therefore, 4g(f(x)) will be 0 when x = ±0.5, and 1 when x = ±0.25. The intersection points must satisfy these conditions. Consider the periodicity: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively. We need to find when both functions simultaneously equal an integer value. Solving these equations, we find that there are 4 intersection points in one period of x and y.
