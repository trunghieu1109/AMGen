Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QYJD', content='We label the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA by the vectors v1,v2,v3,−v1,−v2,−v3 of common length s, so opposite sides are parallel and the hexagon closes.  The three lines supporting AB, CD, EF are the lines through v1,v3,−v2.  One computes the triangle formed by these three lines in terms of s and the angles θ=∠(AB,BC) and φ=∠(BC,CD).  Writing unit‐direction vectors e1=(1,0), e2=(cos θ,sin θ), e3=(cos φ,sin φ) and doing the intersections gives side‐lengths of that triangle as\n   \u2003 ZX  = |h₅/sin θ|,\n  \u2003XY  = |h₅/sin(φ−θ)|,\n  \u2003YZ  = 300,\nwhere h₅ is the signed distance from the AB–CD intersection to the EF line and one finds h₅=s\u2009sin(φ−θ).  Equating ZX=200 and XY=240 yields\n  \u2003s\u2009sin(φ−θ)/sin θ =200,  and  s\u2009sin(φ−θ)/sin(φ−θ)=240,\nfrom which s=240 regardless of φ.  Thus the hexagon’s side length is 240.\n\nAnswer:240', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
