Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, consider the properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Since ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it can be decomposed into two congruent equilateral triangles. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We can use the fact that these sides correspond to the differences in lengths of the opposite sides of the hexagon. Let the side length of the hexagon be 's'. Then, the sides of the triangle can be expressed in terms of s as follows: 2s - s = s for each pair of opposite sides. By considering the geometry and symmetry of the hexagon, we find that the side length of the hexagon is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200, 240, and 300. Calculating the GCD, we find it is 40.
