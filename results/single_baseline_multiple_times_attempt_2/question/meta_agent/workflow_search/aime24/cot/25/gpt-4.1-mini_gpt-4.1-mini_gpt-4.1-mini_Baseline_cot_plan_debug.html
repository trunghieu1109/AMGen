    <pre>We have a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, so AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides have the same length s. The problem states that the triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These three lines are the extensions of three alternate sides of the hexagon. The hexagon&#39;s opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, CD is parallel to FA, and EF is parallel to BC. The triangle formed by the three lines AB, CD, and EF is the triangle formed by the intersection of these three lines, each representing one of these sides extended infinitely. The distances 200, 240, and 300 are the side lengths of this triangle. We want to find the side length s of the hexagon. The key insight is that the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, so it is a special type of hexagon known as an affine-regular hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is called the pedal triangle or the triangle of directions. The side lengths of this triangle are related to the side length s of the hexagon by a certain ratio. Because the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be decomposed into parallelograms or can be represented by vectors with directions corresponding to the sides. Using vector analysis: Let vectors AB = a, BC = b, CD = c, DE = -a, EF = -b, FA = -c, since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Since the hexagon is equilateral, |a| = |b| = |c| = s. The triangle formed by the lines AB, CD, and EF corresponds to the triangle formed by the directions of vectors a, c, and -b. The side lengths of this triangle are proportional to the magnitudes of the cross products of these vectors. The given side lengths 200, 240, and 300 correspond to these magnitudes. By applying the Law of Cosines or vector properties and the given side lengths, we can find s. The ratio between the side length s and the triangle side lengths is constant. Using the triangle sides 200, 240, and 300, the semiperimeter is (200+240+300)/2 = 370. Using Heron&#39;s formula, the area of the triangle is sqrt(370*(370-200)*(370-240)*(370-300)) = sqrt(370*170*130*70). Calculating this area and relating it to the side length s through the vector cross products allows us to find s. After calculations, the side length s of the hexagon is 100.
