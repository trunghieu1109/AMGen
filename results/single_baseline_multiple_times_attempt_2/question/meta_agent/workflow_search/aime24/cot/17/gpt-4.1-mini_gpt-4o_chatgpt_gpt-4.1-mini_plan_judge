Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to the system of equations: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. One approach is to use generating functions or combinatorial methods to find solutions to the first equation, and then check which of those satisfy the second equation. However, the second equation is quite complex. Notice that if we assume symmetry or simplify by assuming two variables are equal, we might find solutions more easily. Let's consider if a = b = c, then 3a = 300, so a = 100, but this doesn't satisfy the second equation. Let's try a = 100, b = 100, c = 100, then a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6(100^3) = 6,000,000, which satisfies both equations. Therefore, (100, 100, 100) is a solution. We need to consider if there are other solutions. By symmetry, permutations of this solution are considered the same, but we should check if other integer combinations work. Since the expression is symmetric and large, it's likely this is the only solution, as any deviation will cause the polynomial to deviate from 6,000,000 due to the cubic terms. Thus, (100, 100, 100) is the only solution.
