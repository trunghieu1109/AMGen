Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given nonnegative integers (a,b,c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be rewritten by grouping terms: a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substitute these into the expression: a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This expands to 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. We also know a + b + c = 300. Using the identity for the sum of cubes: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca), and since a + b + c = 300, we can express a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of symmetric sums. To simplify, let's denote S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. We know from the identity: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca). So, a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3S3 + 300^3 - 3*300*S2 = 3S3 + 27,000,000 - 900 S2. Similarly, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 = 300^2 - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2. Substitute back into the equation: 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000 becomes 300(90,000 - 2S2) - [3S3 + 27,000,000 - 900 S2] = 6,000,000. Calculate: 27,000,000 - 600 S2 - 3S3 - 27,000,000 + 900 S2 = 6,000,000, which simplifies to (300 S2) - 3 S3 = 6,000,000. Divide both sides by 3: 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. So the key equation is 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Now, since a + b + c = 300 and a,b,c are nonnegative integers, we want to find all triples (a,b,c) satisfying 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. We can try to find integer solutions by testing possible values. Because the problem is symmetric, we can assume a ≤ b ≤ c. We can try to find solutions by trial or by considering special cases. One approach is to fix a and b and solve for c from the sum and the equation. Alternatively, since the equation is symmetric, try to find solutions with two variables equal, say a = b = x. Then c = 300 - 2x. Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = x*x + x*(300 - 2x) + x*(300 - 2x) = x^2 + 2x(300 - 2x) = x^2 + 600x - 4x^2 = -3x^2 + 600x. Similarly, S3 = a*b*c = x*x*(300 - 2x) = x^2(300 - 2x) = 300 x^2 - 2 x^3. Substitute into 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000: 100(-3x^2 + 600x) - (300 x^2 - 2 x^3) = 2,000,000. Compute: -300 x^2 + 60,000 x - 300 x^2 + 2 x^3 = 2,000,000. Combine terms: 2 x^3 - 600 x^2 + 60,000 x = 2,000,000. Divide all by 2: x^3 - 300 x^2 + 30,000 x = 1,000,000. We look for integer x between 0 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2x must be ≥ 0). Test integer values to find roots: For x=100: 100^3 - 300*100^2 + 30,000*100 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 1,000,000. So x=100 is a root. Then c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So (100,100,100) is a solution. Check the original equation: a + b + c = 300, check 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. ab + bc + ca = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000. 100 * 30,000 = 3,000,000. abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000. 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. Matches perfectly. So (100,100,100) is a solution. Since the problem is symmetric, permutations of (100,100,100) are the same triple. Now check if there are other solutions with two variables equal. Factor the cubic: (x - 100)(x^2 - 200 x + 10,000) = 0. The quadratic discriminant is 200^2 - 4*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0, so double root at x=100. So the only solution with a=b is x=100. Next, try a=0. Then b + c = 300, and 100(bc) - 0 = 2,000,000 => 100 bc = 2,000,000 => bc = 20,000. We want b,c ≥ 0 integers with b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000. Solve for c: c = 300 - b. So b(300 - b) = 20,000 => 300 b - b^2 = 20,000 => b^2 - 300 b + 20,000 = 0. Discriminant D = 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. sqrt(D) = 100. So b = (300 ± 100)/2 = 200 or 100. So b=100 => c=200, or b=200 => c=100. So solutions (0,100,200), (0,200,100). By symmetry, also permutations of these. So these are valid solutions. Now check if there are other solutions with a=0. No other since quadratic roots are only 100 and 200. Try a=1. Then b + c = 299, and 100(bc + b + c) - 1*bc = 2,000,000. Since S2 = ab + bc + ca = b + c + bc (because a=1), so S2 = b + c + bc = 299 + bc. Then 100 S2 - abc = 100*(299 + bc) - 1*bc = 29,900 + 100 bc - bc = 29,900 + 99 bc = 2,000,000. So 99 bc = 2,000,000 - 29,900 = 1,970,100. So bc = 1,970,100 / 99 = 19,900. So bc = 19,900 with b + c = 299. Solve c = 299 - b, so b(299 - b) = 19,900 => b^2 - 299 b + 19,900 = 0. Discriminant D = 299^2 - 4*19,900 = 89,401 - 79,600 = 9,801. sqrt(9,801) = 99. So b = (299 ± 99)/2 = 199 or 100. So b=100 => c=199, or b=199 => c=100. So (1,100,199) and permutations. Similarly for a=2, we can check the pattern: a=2, b + c = 298, S2 = ab + bc + ca = 2b + 2c + bc = 2(b + c) + bc = 2*298 + bc = 596 + bc. Then 100 S2 - abc = 100*(596 + bc) - 2*bc = 59,600 + 100 bc - 2 bc = 59,600 + 98 bc = 2,000,000. So 98 bc = 2,000,000 - 59,600 = 1,940,400. So bc = 1,940,400 / 98 = 19,800. Then b + c = 298, b c = 19,800. Quadratic: b^2 - 298 b + 19,800 = 0. Discriminant D = 298^2 - 4*19,800 = 88,804 - 79,200 = 9,604. sqrt(9,604) = 98. So b = (298 ± 98)/2 = 200 or 99. So (2,99,199) and permutations. This suggests a pattern: For a = k, b + c = 300 - k, and bc = 20,000 - 100 k. Then the quadratic is b^2 - (300 - k) b + (20,000 - 100 k) = 0. The discriminant D = (300 - k)^2 - 4 (20,000 - 100 k) = (300 - k)^2 - 80,000 + 400 k = 90,000 - 600 k + k^2 - 80,000 + 400 k = 10,000 - 200 k + k^2. We want D to be a perfect square. Let D = m^2. So m^2 = k^2 - 200 k + 10,000. Rewrite as m^2 = (k - 100)^2 - 10,000. So (k - 100)^2 - m^2 = 10,000. This is a difference of squares: ((k - 100) - m)((k - 100) + m) = 10,000. Let x = (k - 100) - m, y = (k - 100) + m, so x y = 10,000. Also k - 100 = (x + y)/2. Since k, m integers, x and y are integers with the same parity. Factor 10,000 = 2^4 * 5^4. The positive factor pairs of 10,000 are (1,10000), (2,5000), (4,2500), (5,2000), (8,1250), (10,1000), (16,625), (20,500), (25,400), (40,250), (50,200), (80,125), (100,100). For each pair (x,y), k = 100 + (x + y)/2. We want k between 0 and 300. Check pairs: (40,250): x+y=290, k=100+145=245 (valid). (50,200): x+y=250, k=100+125=225 (valid). (80,125): x+y=205, k=100+102.5=202.5 (not integer). (100,100): x+y=200, k=100+100=200 (valid). (25,400): x+y=425, k=100+212.5=312.5 (no). (20,500): k=100+260=360 (no). (16,625): k=100+320.5=420.5 (no). (10,1000): k=100+505=605 (no). (8,1250): k=100+629=729 (no). (5,2000): k=100+1002.5=1102.5 (no). (4,2500): k=100+1252=1352 (no). (2,5000): k=100+2501=2601 (no). (1,10000): k=100+5000.5=5100.5 (no). Also consider negative factors: (-40,-250): sum -290, k=100 -145=-45 (no). (-50,-200): k=100 -125=-25 (no). (-100,-100): k=100 -100=0 (valid). So k=0, 200, 225, 245 are possible. For each k, bc = 20,000 - 100 k. For k=0: bc=20,000, b+c=300. Already found solutions (0,100,200). For k=200: bc=20,000 - 20,000=0, b+c=100. So bc=0 means either b=0 or c=0. So (200,0,100) or (200,100,0). For k=225: bc=20,000 - 22,500 = -2,500 (no, bc cannot be negative). For k=245: bc=20,000 - 24,500 = -4,500 (no). So only k=0, 100, 200 are valid. We have already found k=100 corresponds to (100,100,100). k=0 corresponds to (0,100,200) and permutations. k=200 corresponds to (200,0,100) and permutations. Check if k=200 is valid: b+c=100, bc=0, so (b,c) = (0,100) or (100,0). So triples (200,0,100), (200,100,0), etc. Now count the number of distinct triples: For (100,100,100), only one triple since all equal. For (0,100,200), the distinct permutations are (0,100,200), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (200,100,0) total 6. For (200,0,100), same as above, already counted. For (200,0,100) and (0,200,100), these are permutations of the same triple. So total distinct triples are 1 (all equal) + 6 (two distinct numbers) = 7. But we must consider the case k=1,2,... We found that for k=1,2,... the quadratic has integer roots and solutions. Actually, the previous pattern suggested that for k from 0 to 100, the quadratic has integer roots when the discriminant is a perfect square. The difference of squares equation gave us factor pairs of 10,000. The factor pairs correspond to possible values of k. We found k=0,100,200. But for k=1,2,... we had bc values like 19,900, 19,800, etc. which also gave integer roots. So the pattern continues for k=0 to 100 with integer roots. Let's check for k=50: D = (300 - 50)^2 - 4(20,000 - 100*50) = 250^2 - 4(20,000 - 5,000) = 62,500 - 4(15,000) = 62,500 - 60,000 = 2,500, sqrt=50, integer. So k=50 is valid. So k ranges from 0 to 100 where D is a perfect square. The difference of squares equation shows that (k-100)^2 - m^2 = 10,000. So (k-100 - m)(k-100 + m) = 10,000. So the number of integer solutions corresponds to the number of factor pairs of 10,000. Since 10,000 has 25 positive divisors, it has (25 + 1)/2 = 13 factor pairs. So there are 13 pairs (x,y) with x*y=10,000, and each pair corresponds to a unique k. Thus, there are 13 values of k for which there exist integer solutions. For each k, the quadratic equation has two roots (b,c), so two values unless the roots coincide. When roots coincide, discriminant zero, but that would correspond to a single solution. So for each k, except possibly one, there are two roots (b,c). For each (a,b,c), permutations count. For the case where all three are equal, only one triple. For cases where two are equal, the number of permutations is 3. For three distinct numbers, permutations are 6. We need to count the total number of triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers satisfying the conditions. The possible solutions are triples (k,b,c) with k from the 13 values, and b,c roots of the quadratic. For each such triple, permutations generate all solutions. Since the problem is symmetric, the number of solutions is the number of distinct triples (a,b,c). Counting the number of solutions, for each k, the quadratic has two roots b and c with b+c=300 - k, bc=20,000 - 100 k. If roots are distinct, then (k,b,c) and (k,c,b) are different ordered triples but represent the same unordered triple. Since we consider triples (a,b,c) unordered, we consider permutations. Finally, the number of distinct unordered triples is equal to the number of integer solutions (k,b,c) up to permutations. For each k, there are two roots, giving one unordered pair {b,c}. So total number of unordered triples is equal to the number of k values (13). Among these, one corresponds to all equal (100,100,100), so total number of triples is 13. So the answer is 13.
