Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fCEa', content='We seek nonnegative (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and E=a^2b+a^2c+b^2a+b^2c+c^2a+c^2b=6,000,000.  Note E=300(a^2+b^2+c^2)−(a^3+b^3+c^3), leading to the diophantine condition which factors to show that every solution has one coordinate 100, say c=k, and the other two are 100 and 200−k.  Allowing all orderings and k∈{0,…,100}, we get 101 unordered triples: for k=0,...,99 three distinct values ⇒6 permutations each (100,0,200),…,(100,99,101), and for k=100 the one triple (100,100,100) ⇒1 permutation.  Total ordered solutions =1+100*6=601.\n\nAnswer:601', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
