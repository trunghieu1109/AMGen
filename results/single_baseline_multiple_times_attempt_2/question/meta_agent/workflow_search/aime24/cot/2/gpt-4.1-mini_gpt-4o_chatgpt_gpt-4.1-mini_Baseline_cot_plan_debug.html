    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly colored octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices are moved to positions that were originally red. First, consider the symmetries of the octagon. The octagon can be rotated by multiples of 45 degrees, giving 8 possible rotations (0, 45, 90, ..., 315 degrees). For a rotation to map blue vertices to positions that were originally red, the color pattern must be invariant under some rotation. Let&#39;s analyze the probability of such color patterns:

1. Total number of colorings: Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are 2^8 = 256 total colorings.
2. Favorable colorings: We need to count colorings that are invariant under some rotation. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we calculate the number of invariant colorings:
   - 0-degree rotation (identity): All 256 colorings are invariant.
   - 45-degree rotation: For a coloring to be invariant, all vertices must be the same color. There are 2 such colorings (all red or all blue).
   - 90-degree rotation: Vertices must be the same color in groups of 4. There are 2^2 = 4 such colorings (all vertices in each group of 4 are the same, and there are 2 choices per group).
   - 135-degree rotation: Similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color. There are 2 such colorings.
   - 180-degree rotation: Vertices must be the same color in pairs. There are 2^4 = 16 such colorings.
   - 225-degree rotation: Similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color. There are 2 such colorings.
   - 270-degree rotation: Similar to 90 degrees, there are 4 such colorings.
   - 315-degree rotation: Similar to 45 degrees, there are 2 such colorings.

Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of invariant colorings is the average number of invariant colorings per rotation: (256 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 4 + 2) / 8 = 288 / 8 = 36.

The probability that a coloring is invariant under some rotation is 36/256 = 9/64. Thus, m = 9 and n = 64, and m and n are relatively prime.

Therefore, m + n = 9 + 64 = 73.
