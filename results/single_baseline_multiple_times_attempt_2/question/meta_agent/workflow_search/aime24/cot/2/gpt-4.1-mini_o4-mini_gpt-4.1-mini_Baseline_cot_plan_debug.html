    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We want the probability that a random 2‐coloring of the 8 vertices admits a nontrivial rotation sending all blue vertices to originally red positions. Equivalently, for the set B of blue vertices, there exists k≠0 mod 8 with B∩(B+k)=∅. Let A_k be the property B∩(B+k)=∅. We seek |⋃_{k=1}^7A_k|/2^8. Inclusion–exclusion over 7 shifts is tedious, so instead count the complement E of colorings with no such rotation: B such that for every k&gt;0, B∩(B+k)≠∅. One checks that every B with |B|≥5 automatically lies in E (93 subsets). For |B|=4, one needs that for each k∈{1,2,3,4}, there is a pair in B at distance k; by counting 4‐subsets whose pairwise distances cover {1,2,3,4}, one finds 58 such B. No B of size ≤3 lies in E. Hence |E|=93+58=151, so the number of “good” colorings is 256−151=105, giving probability 105/256, so m+n=105+256=361.
