Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider paths on an 8x8 grid that consist of 16 steps, with exactly 4 changes in direction. A path from the lower left to the upper right corner consists of 8 'right' (R) moves and 8 'up' (U) moves. A change in direction occurs when the path switches from R to U or from U to R. We need to arrange the sequence of 8 Rs and 8 Us such that there are exactly 4 changes in direction.

A change in direction can be represented as a block of Rs followed by a block of Us or vice versa. If there are 4 changes in direction, the sequence of Rs and Us can be divided into 5 blocks (since each change in direction separates two blocks).

Let's consider the possible block structures:
1. R-U-R-U-R-U-R-U (4 changes, 8 blocks)
2. R-R-U-U-R-R-U-U (4 changes, 4 blocks)
3. R-R-R-U-U-U-R-R-R-U-U-U (4 changes, 2 blocks)

However, the only valid structure that results in exactly 4 changes is the one with 5 blocks: R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U, since each change separates two blocks.

Let's consider the R-U-R-U-R structure. We can have:
- 5 blocks with sizes: a, b, c, d, e
- a + c + e = 8 (total R moves)
- b + d = 8 (total U moves)

The changes in direction occur at the boundaries of the blocks, and the sequence must start and end with R or U. This means we have two main cases:
- Case 1: R-U-R-U-R (starts and ends with R)
- Case 2: U-R-U-R-U (starts and ends with U)

For Case 1: R-U-R-U-R
- The conditions are: a + c + e = 8, b + d = 8
- Choose a, c, e such that a + c + e = 8 and b, d such that b + d = 8
- Number of solutions: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) for a, c, e and \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) for b, d
- Total for Case 1: 21 * 7 = 147

For Case 2: U-R-U-R-U
- The conditions are similar: b + d + f = 8, a + c = 8
- Number of solutions: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) for b, d, f and \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) for a, c
- Total for Case 2: 21 * 7 = 147

Adding both cases, we get the total number of paths with exactly 4 changes in direction:
147 + 147 = 294.
