Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We are considering paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner (0,0) to the upper right corner (8,8). Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps to the right (R) and 8 steps up (U). A path is a sequence of 16 moves, each being R or U, with exactly 8 Rs and 8 Us in total.

We want the number of such paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. For example, the sequence RRRUUURR... has direction changes where the sequence switches from R to U or U to R.

Step 1: Understand the problem in terms of runs.
A path with exactly 4 direction changes has 5 runs (a run is a maximal sequence of the same direction). For example, a path might look like RRR...R UUU...U RRR...R UUU...U RRR...R, alternating between R and U exactly 5 times.

Step 2: Since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), and the moves are only right or up, the path must have exactly 8 Rs and 8 Us.

Step 3: The path consists of 5 runs, alternating between R and U. There are two possible patterns for the runs:
- Pattern A: R U R U R (starts with R, ends with R)
- Pattern B: U R U R U (starts with U, ends with U)

Step 4: Each run must have at least one step. Let the lengths of the runs be x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.

For Pattern A (R U R U R):
- x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 (total Rs)
- x2 + x4 = 8 (total Us)

For Pattern B (U R U R U):
- x2 + x4 = 8 (Rs)
- x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 (Us)

Step 5: Count the number of integer solutions with each xi >= 1.

Number of solutions for sum of k positive integers equal to n is C(n-1, k-1).

For Pattern A:
- Number of solutions for x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 with xi >= 1 is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7, 2) = 21
- Number of solutions for x2 + x4 = 8 with xi >= 1 is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7, 1) = 7
- Total solutions for Pattern A = 21 * 7 = 147

For Pattern B:
- Number of solutions for x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 with xi >= 1 is C(7, 2) = 21
- Number of solutions for x2 + x4 = 8 with xi >= 1 is C(7, 1) = 7
- Total solutions for Pattern B = 21 * 7 = 147

Step 6: Total number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes = 147 + 147 = 294.

Therefore, the answer is 294.
