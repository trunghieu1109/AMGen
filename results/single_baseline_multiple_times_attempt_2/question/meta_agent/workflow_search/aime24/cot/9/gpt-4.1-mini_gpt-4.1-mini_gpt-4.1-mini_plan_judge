Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4). 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. The lottery also chooses 4 distinct numbers from S.

We want to find the probability that Jen's 4 numbers exactly match the 4 chosen numbers (winning the grand prize), given that she wins a prize (i.e., at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 chosen).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Probability of winning grand prize given winning a prize is:
P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize and prize) / P(prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize), since grand prize implies prize.

Step 3: P(grand prize) = Number of ways the chosen 4 numbers equal Jen's 4 numbers / total ways = 1/210.

Step 4: Calculate P(prize) = Probability that at least 2 of Jen's numbers are in the chosen 4 numbers.

Jen's numbers: fixed set of 4 numbers.
Chosen 4 numbers: random 4 numbers from 10.

We count the number of 4-number subsets of S that have at least 2 numbers in common with Jen's 4 numbers.

Let Jen's set be J (size 4).

We want to count subsets T of size 4 such that |J ∩ T| ≥ 2.

Calculate:
- Number of subsets with exactly 2 common numbers:
  Choose 2 from Jen's 4: C(4,2) = 6
  Choose remaining 2 from the other 6 numbers: C(6,2) = 15
  Total: 6*15=90

- Number of subsets with exactly 3 common numbers:
  Choose 3 from Jen's 4: C(4,3)=4
  Choose remaining 1 from other 6: C(6,1)=6
  Total: 4*6=24

- Number of subsets with exactly 4 common numbers:
  Choose 4 from Jen's 4: C(4,4)=1
  Choose 0 from other 6: C(6,0)=1
  Total: 1

Sum: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

Step 5: P(prize) = 115/210

Step 6: P(grand prize | prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115

Step 7: The fraction is 1/115, which is already in lowest terms.

Step 8: m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
