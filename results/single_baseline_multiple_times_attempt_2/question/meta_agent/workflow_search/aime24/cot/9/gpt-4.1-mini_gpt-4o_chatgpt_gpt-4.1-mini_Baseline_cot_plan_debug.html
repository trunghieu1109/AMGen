    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she wins a prize. First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). 

Next, we find the number of ways Jen can win a prize, which is when at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. We can break this into cases:

1. Exactly 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen: 
   - Choose 2 of Jen&#39;s 4 numbers: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
   - Choose 2 numbers from the 6 not chosen by Jen: \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \)
   - Total for this case: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

2. Exactly 3 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen:
   - Choose 3 of Jen&#39;s 4 numbers: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Choose 1 number from the 6 not chosen by Jen: \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \)
   - Total for this case: \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)

3. All 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen:
   - This is simply 1 way, as all 4 numbers must be chosen.

Adding these cases gives the total number of ways to win a prize: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).

The number of ways to win the grand prize is simply the number of ways all 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen, which is 1.

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she wins a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \).

Thus, this probability is already in simplest form with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).
