Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she wins a prize. First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). 

Next, we find the number of ways Jen can win a prize, which is when at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. We can break this into cases:

1. Exactly 2 of Jen's numbers are chosen: 
   - Choose 2 of Jen's 4 numbers: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
   - Choose 2 numbers from the 6 not chosen by Jen: \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \)
   - Total for this case: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

2. Exactly 3 of Jen's numbers are chosen:
   - Choose 3 of Jen's 4 numbers: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Choose 1 number from the 6 not chosen by Jen: \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \)
   - Total for this case: \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)

3. All 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen:
   - This is simply 1 way, as all 4 numbers must be chosen.

Adding these cases gives the total number of ways to win a prize: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).

The number of ways to win the grand prize is simply the number of ways all 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen, which is 1.

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she wins a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \).

Thus, this probability is already in simplest form with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).
