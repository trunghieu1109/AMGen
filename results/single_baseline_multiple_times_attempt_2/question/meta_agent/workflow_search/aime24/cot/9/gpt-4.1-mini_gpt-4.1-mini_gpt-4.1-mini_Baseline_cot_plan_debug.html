    <pre>First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4). 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. The lottery also chooses 4 distinct numbers from S.

We want to find the probability that Jen&#39;s 4 numbers exactly match the 4 chosen numbers (winning the grand prize), given that she wins a prize (i.e., at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 chosen).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Probability of winning grand prize given winning a prize is:
P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize and prize) / P(prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize), since grand prize implies prize.

Step 3: P(grand prize) = Number of ways the chosen 4 numbers equal Jen&#39;s 4 numbers / total ways = 1/210.

Step 4: Calculate P(prize) = Probability that at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are in the chosen 4 numbers.

Jen&#39;s numbers: fixed set of 4 numbers.
Chosen 4 numbers: random 4 numbers from 10.

We count the number of 4-number subsets of S that have at least 2 numbers in common with Jen&#39;s 4 numbers.

Let Jen&#39;s set be J (size 4).

We want to count subsets T of size 4 such that |J ∩ T| ≥ 2.

Calculate:
- Number of subsets with exactly 2 common numbers:
  Choose 2 from Jen&#39;s 4: C(4,2) = 6
  Choose remaining 2 from the other 6 numbers: C(6,2) = 15
  Total: 6*15=90

- Number of subsets with exactly 3 common numbers:
  Choose 3 from Jen&#39;s 4: C(4,3)=4
  Choose remaining 1 from other 6: C(6,1)=6
  Total: 4*6=24

- Number of subsets with exactly 4 common numbers:
  Choose 4 from Jen&#39;s 4: C(4,4)=1
  Choose 0 from other 6: C(6,0)=1
  Total: 1

Sum: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

Step 5: P(prize) = 115/210

Step 6: P(grand prize | prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115

Step 7: The fraction is 1/115, which is already in lowest terms.

Step 8: m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
