Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We have a tetrahedron ABCD with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89. Such a tetrahedron is circumscribable and its inradius r satisfies r=3V/S, where V is volume and S is total surface area.  

1. Compute the volume via the formula for an isosceles tetrahedron with opposite edges equal.  If u=AB, v=AC, w=AD and u²=41, v²=80, w²=89, then
   144V² = 4u²v²w² – u²(v²+w²–u²)² – v²(w²+u²–v²)² – w²(u²+v²–w²)²
            + (v²+w²–u²)(w²+u²–v²)(u²+v²–w²).
  Plugging in gives 144V² = 409600, so V²=25600/9 and V=160/3.  

2. Compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC, with side‐lengths √41, √80, √89.  By Heron’s formula,
   16K² = 2(41·80 + 80·89 + 89·41) – (41² + 80² + 89²) = 12096,
   so K = √(12096/16) = √756 = 6√21.  
  All four faces are congruent, so the surface area S=4·6√21=24√21.  

3. Thus the inradius is
   r = 3V/S = (3·(160/3))/(24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63.
  This is of the form (m√n)/p with m=20, n=21, p=63, so m+n+p=20+21+63=104.
