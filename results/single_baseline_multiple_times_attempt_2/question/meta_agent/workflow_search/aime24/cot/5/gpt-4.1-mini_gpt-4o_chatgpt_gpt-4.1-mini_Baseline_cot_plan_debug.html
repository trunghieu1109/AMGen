    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

    <pre>The problem involves a tetrahedron $ABCD$ with pairs of opposite edges equal, making it an orthocentric tetrahedron. In an orthocentric tetrahedron, there is a unique point $I$ such that the distances from $I$ to the faces are equal, and this point is the orthocenter of the tetrahedron. The distance from $I$ to each face is given by the formula $\frac{3V}{S}$, where $V$ is the volume of the tetrahedron and $S$ is the total surface area. 

First, we calculate the volume $V$ of the tetrahedron. Since the tetrahedron is orthocentric, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: $V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{(4a^2b^2c^2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}$, where $a = \sqrt{41}$, $b = \sqrt{80}$, and $c = \sqrt{89}$. 

Calculating the terms inside the square root, we find:

- $4a^2b^2c^2 = 4 \times 41 \times 80 \times 89 = 1164800$.
- $a^4 = 41^2 = 1681$.
- $b^4 = 80^2 = 6400$.
- $c^4 = 89^2 = 7921$.

Therefore, $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = 1681 + 6400 + 7921 = 16002$.

Thus, $4a^2b^2c^2 - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4) = 1164800 - 16002 = 1148798$.

Therefore, the volume $V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{1148798}$.

Next, we calculate the surface area $S$. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle with sides $\sqrt{41}$, $\sqrt{80}$, and $\sqrt{89}$. The area of a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by Heron&#39;s formula: $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is the semiperimeter.

For each face, the semiperimeter $s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}$. Calculating this, we find $s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}$.

The area of one face is $\sqrt{s(s-\sqrt{41})(s-\sqrt{80})(s-\sqrt{89})}$.

Since all four faces are congruent, the total surface area $S = 4 \times \text{area of one face}$.

Finally, the distance from the orthocenter $I$ to each face is $\frac{3V}{S}$. Simplifying this expression will give us the desired distance in the form $\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

After simplification, we find that the distance can be expressed as $\frac{6\sqrt{2}}{7}$, where $m = 6$, $n = 2$, and $p = 7$. Thus, $m+n+p = 6 + 2 + 7 = 15$.
