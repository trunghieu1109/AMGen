Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Ju4B', content='We are given a 5x5 grid and 25 white chips and 25 black chips. Each cell can have at most one chip. All chips in the same row and column must have the same color. We want to place the maximum number of chips such that adding any more would violate these conditions.\n\nFirst, note that if all chips in a row and all chips in a column have the same color, then the grid must be filled in a way that respects both row and column color uniformity. \n\nConsider placing 5 chips of the same color in one row. Then, the entire column containing any of these chips must also be filled with chips of the same color. This suggests that we can fill the grid by using a single color to fill a complete row and its corresponding columns.\n\nOne solution is to fill the grid with one color in a pattern that respects both row and column uniformity. We can fill the grid with a diagonal pattern where each diagonal has a different color. This way, each row and each column will have chips of the same color.\n\nSince the grid is symmetric, we can fill the diagonal with one color and the remaining with the other color. This ensures each row and column has uniform color without exceeding the available chips.\n\nFor example, we can fill the main diagonal with white chips and the rest with black chips, or vice versa.\n\nAnswer:2', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
