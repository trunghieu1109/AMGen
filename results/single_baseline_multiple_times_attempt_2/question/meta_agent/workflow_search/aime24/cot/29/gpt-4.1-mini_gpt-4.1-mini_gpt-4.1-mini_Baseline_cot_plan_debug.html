    <pre>We have a 5x5 grid with 25 cells. We want to place chips (white or black) on some cells such that:
1. Each cell contains at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row have the same color.
3. All chips in the same column have the same color.
4. The placement is maximal in the sense that adding any additional chip would violate one or more of the above conditions.

First, let&#39;s analyze the color constraints:
- Each row is monochromatic (all chips in that row are the same color).
- Each column is monochromatic (all chips in that column are the same color).

This implies that the color of the chip in cell (i, j) (if any) must be consistent with both the row i color and the column j color.

If a cell contains a chip, its color is determined by the intersection of the row color and the column color. For the chip to exist, the row color and column color must be the same.

Therefore, the grid can be thought of as a coloring of rows and columns in black or white, and the chips are placed exactly where the row and column colors agree.

Define:
- Let R be a subset of rows colored black (the rest white).
- Let C be a subset of columns colored black (the rest white).

Then, the black chips are placed at the intersection of black rows and black columns.
The white chips are placed at the intersection of white rows and white columns.

No chips are placed where row and column colors differ.

The maximality condition means:
- We cannot add any chip to a cell where there was no chip before without violating the conditions.

Where are the empty cells?
- Cells where row and column colors differ.

Can we add a chip to such a cell?
- If we add a chip to a cell where row and column colors differ, the cell would have a chip of one color, but the row or column would have chips of a different color, violating the monochromatic row or column condition.

So, the only way to add a chip without violating the conditions is to recolor the row or column to match the new chip color, but recoloring is not allowed (the coloring is fixed).

Hence, maximality means the following:
- For every empty cell, adding a chip would violate the conditions.
- Also, no empty cell can be filled without recoloring.

But we must also consider the limited number of chips: 25 white and 25 black.

Number of black chips placed: |R| * |C|
Number of white chips placed: (5 - |R|) * (5 - |C|)

We must have:
|R| * |C| &lt;= 25 (black chips available)
(5 - |R|) * (5 - |C|) &lt;= 25 (white chips available)

Since 25 chips of each color are available, these constraints are automatically satisfied because the grid is 5x5.

Now, maximality condition implies that no row or column can be recolored to add a chip.

If a row has no chips, recoloring it would add chips, but no chips can be added.

Similarly for columns.

Therefore, every row and every column must have at least one chip.

When does a row have no chips?
- If the row is black but there is no black column (|C|=0), then black rows have no chips.
- If the row is white but there is no white column (|C|=5), then white rows have no chips.

Similarly for columns.

So, to ensure every row and column has at least one chip, both |R| and |C| must be between 1 and 4 inclusive.

Because if |R|=0, no black rows; if |C|=0, no black columns; if |R|=5, no white rows; if |C|=5, no white columns.

Therefore, |R| and |C| can be any integer from 1 to 4.

Number of ways to choose R: C(5, |R|)
Number of ways to choose C: C(5, |C|)

For each such pair (|R|, |C|) with |R|, |C| in {1,2,3,4}, number of configurations is C(5, |R|)*C(5, |C|).

Total number of configurations = sum over |R|=1 to 4 and |C|=1 to 4 of C(5, |R|)*C(5, |C|)
= (sum_{r=1}^4 C(5,r)) * (sum_{c=1}^4 C(5,c))

Calculate sum_{k=1}^4 C(5,k):
C(5,1)=5, C(5,2)=10, C(5,3)=10, C(5,4)=5
Sum = 5+10+10+5 = 30

Therefore, total configurations = 30 * 30 = 900

Hence, there are 900 ways to place the chips satisfying the conditions.
