Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2efO', content='We need maximal placements subject to row/column colour-consistency. One shows that in any maximal placement every row and column must already contain chips (otherwise we could add one); thus all 5 rows and 5 columns are used. Assign each row and each column a colour (white or black): 2^5 for rows × 2^5 for columns = 2^{10}=1024. For each assignment we fill exactly those cells where row‐ and column‐colours match; the resulting configuration is maximal. The supply constraint (25 of each colour) is never tight since at most 5×5=25 chips of one colour are used. Hence the total number of ways is 1024.\n\nAnswer:1024', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
