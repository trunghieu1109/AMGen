\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The given expression is a product over all 13th roots of unity, except 1. The 13th roots of unity satisfy the equation $x^{13} - 1 = 0$, and $rac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{12} + x^{11} + \ldots + x + 1 = 0$ for $x \neq 1$. Thus, the product over all non-trivial 13th roots of unity is the constant term of this polynomial, which is 1. However, the expression has a different form, so let's simplify it. Consider the expression for each $k$: $2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}$. This can be rewritten as $2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^k$. For $\omega^k$, a 13th root of unity, $\omega^{13} = 1$. So, $\omega^k$ is a root of $x^{13} - 1 = 0$, and the product over all $k$ is a symmetric function of the roots. Using properties of roots of unity, the product of all terms in the form $1 - \omega^k$ for $k = 1$ to 12 is 13. The term $\omega^{2k}$ will be handled similarly. The expression simplifies using symmetry and properties of roots of unity. Finally, the remainder when dividing by 1000 needs to be calculated.
