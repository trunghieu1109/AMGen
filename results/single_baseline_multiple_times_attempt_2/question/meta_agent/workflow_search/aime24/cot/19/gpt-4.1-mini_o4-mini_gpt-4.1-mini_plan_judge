Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need P = ∏_{k=0 to 12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity.  Note that 2 - 2x + x^2 = (x−1)^2 +1 = f(x).  Then P = ∏_{α^13=1} f(α) = Res(x^13−1, f(x)).  Equivalently, since f(x) = x^2−2x+2 has roots β = 1±i, the resultant also equals ∏_{β roots of f} (β^13−1).  Compute (1+i)^13 = (√2 e^{iπ/4})^13 = 2^{6.5} e^{i13π/4} = −64(1+i).  Thus (1+i)^13−1 = −65−64i.  Its conjugate for (1−i) gives −65+64i.  Hence P = (−65−64i)(−65+64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.  Therefore 8321 mod 1000 = 321.
