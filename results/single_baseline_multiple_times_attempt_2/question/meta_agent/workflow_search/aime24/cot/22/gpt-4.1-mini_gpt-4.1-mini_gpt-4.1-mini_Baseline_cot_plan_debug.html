    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. The list consists of positive integers.
2. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
3. The unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
4. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (because for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element which must be in the list). For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the two middle elements must be consecutive integers (e.g., 4 and 5, median 4.5 is not an integer; but if the two middle elements are 4 and 6, median is 5 which is an integer not in the list).

So the median is the average of two consecutive elements a and b where b = a + 2, so median = (a + b)/2 = a + 1, which is not in the list.

Let&#39;s denote the list as sorted: x_1 &lt;= x_2 &lt;= ... &lt;= x_n

Let n be even, n = 2m.
Median = (x_m + x_{m+1}) / 2 = integer not in the list.

Since the median is integer and not in the list, x_m and x_{m+1} differ by 2.

The unique mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let&#39;s try to find such a list.

Try n=6:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Median = (x_3 + x_4)/2 = integer not in list
x_3 and x_4 differ by 2.

Try x_3=4, x_4=6 =&gt; median=5 (not in list)

We want 9 to be the unique mode.

Try to include two 9&#39;s (since 9 must be the most frequent).

Sum of list = 30.

Let&#39;s try with two 9&#39;s:
Sum of two 9&#39;s = 18
Remaining sum = 12
We have 4 other elements: x_1, x_2, x_3=4, x_4=6, x_5, x_6
Wait, we fixed x_3=4, x_4=6, but we only have 6 elements total.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
x_3=4, x_4=6
Two 9&#39;s must be in the list.

Try the list: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 9
Sum: 1+3+4+6+9+9=32 &gt; 30
Try smaller numbers:
2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 9 = 33
1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 9 = 31
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 9 = 30 perfect.

Check mode:
9 appears twice
Others appear once
Mode is 9 unique
Median:
Sorted: 1,2,3,6,9,9
Median = (3+6)/2=4.5 not integer
We want median to be integer.

Try x_3=3, x_4=5 median=4 (integer)
Try list: 1,2,3,5,9,9
Sum=1+2+3+5+9+9=29
Try 1,3,3,5,9,9
Sum=1+3+3+5+9+9=30
Median=(3+5)/2=4 integer not in list
Mode: 3 appears twice, 9 appears twice =&gt; no unique mode
Try 1,2,4,6,9,9
Sum=31 no
Try 1,2,4,5,9,9
Sum=30
Median=(4+5)/2=4.5 no
Try 1,4,4,6,9,9
Sum=33 no
Try 2,2,4,6,9,9
Sum=32 no
Try 1,2,3,5,9,9
Sum=29 no
Try 1,3,4,5,9,9
Sum=31 no
Try 1,3,4,5,9,8
Sum=30 no mode 9
Try 1,3,4,6,9,7
Sum=30 no mode 9

Try n=8
Median=(x_4+x_5)/2
Try x_4=4, x_5=6 median=5 integer
Try list with two 9&#39;s and sum 30
Try 1,1,2,4,6,9,9, - one element missing
Sum so far: 1+1+2+4+6+9+9=32
Try 1,1,1,4,6,9,9, - sum=31
Try 1,1,3,4,6,9,9, sum=33
Try 1,1,2,3,4,6,9,9 sum=35

Try n=4
Median=(x_2+x_3)/2
Try x_2=4, x_3=6 median=5
Try list: 4,6,9,9 sum=28
Try 3,5,9,9 sum=26
Try 5,5,9,9 sum=28
Try 4,5,9,9 sum=27
Try 4,7,9,9 sum=29
Try 3,7,9,9 sum=28
Try 2,8,9,9 sum=28
Try 1,9,9,9 sum=28
Try 3,6,9,9 sum=27
Try 2,7,9,9 sum=27
Try 1,8,9,9 sum=27
Try 5,6,9,9 sum=29
Try 4,8,9,9 sum=30 sum perfect
Median=(4+8)/2=6 integer not in list
Mode=9 appears twice
Others appear once
Unique mode=9

List: 4,8,9,9
Sum=30
Median=6 (not in list)
Mode=9 unique

Calculate sum of squares:
4^2=16
8^2=64
9^2=81
9^2=81
Sum=16+64+81+81=242

Answer is 242.
