Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and even length (so the integer median is not itself a list entry). Let the list have length 2k. The median is (x_k+x_{k+1})/2=m (an integer not in the list), so x_k<m<x_{k+1} and x_k+x_{k+1}=2m. The mode 9 must appear at least twice and more often than any other number. Trying n=4 gives two 9â€™s (sum 18) and two other numbers summing to 12. Sorted, x3=x4=9, so median=(x2+9)/2 must be an integer m not in the list. The only possibility is x2=7 (so m=8) and then x1=5. Thus the list is [5,7,9,9]. Check: sum =30; median=(7+9)/2=8 not in list; mode =9. Sum of squares =25+49+81+81=236. No larger even n works (either forces too many small distinct entries or noninteger median).
