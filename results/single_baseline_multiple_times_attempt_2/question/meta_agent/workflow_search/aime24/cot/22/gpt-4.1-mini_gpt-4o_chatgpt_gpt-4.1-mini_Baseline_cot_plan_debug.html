    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given properties and then find the sum of the squares of the numbers in that list.

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Let&#39;s start by considering the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears k times.

To satisfy the median condition, the list must have an odd number of elements, say 2n + 1, so that the median is the (n+1)th element when sorted. The median itself cannot be in the list, which means it should be a number like 8 or 10 if 9 is the mode.

Let&#39;s try k = 3 for 9. Then we have 3 nines, and the rest of the numbers must sum to 30 - 27 = 3. We need to fill the list with numbers such that the median is not in the list.

If we use 1 and 2 as the other numbers, we have:
List: [1, 2, 9, 9, 9]
Sum: 1 + 2 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30
Mode: 9 (appears 3 times, more than any other number)
Median: 9 (middle of sorted list)

This doesn&#39;t work because the median is in the list. Let&#39;s try k = 4 for 9.

List: [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, x]
Sum: 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + x = 30

Solving for x: 2 + 36 + x = 30 -&gt; x = -8, which is not possible.

Let&#39;s try k = 2 for 9.

List: [9, 9, x, y]
Sum: 9 + 9 + x + y = 30

We need 4 numbers, so let&#39;s add 2 more numbers to make the list 2n + 1:
List: [9, 9, x, y, z]
Sum: 9 + 9 + x + y + z = 30

We need the median to be not in the list. Let&#39;s try x = 7, y = 5, z = 0:
List: [0, 5, 7, 9, 9]

This doesn&#39;t work because 0 is not positive.

Let&#39;s try another configuration:
List: [1, 6, 8, 9, 9]
Sum: 1 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 9 = 33

This is more than 30. Let&#39;s try:
List: [1, 5, 6, 9, 9]
Sum: 1 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 30

Mode: 9
Median: 6 (which is in the list)

Let&#39;s try:
List: [1, 2, 8, 9, 9, 1]
Sum: 1 + 2 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 30

Mode: 9
Median: 5 (not in the list)

This works. Now, calculate the sum of squares:
1^2 + 2^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 64 + 81 + 81 + 1 = 232
