    <pre>We have a regular dodecagon (12-gon) with vertices equally spaced on a circle. The problem asks for the number of rectangles that can be formed where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. In other words, the edges of the rectangle must be chords of the 12-gon connecting vertices. 

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- The vertices are placed on a circle at angles 0째, 30째, 60째, ..., 330째.
- Rectangles inscribed in a circle are special: all rectangles inscribed in a circle are cyclic quadrilaterals with right angles.
- The rectangle must have its sides along chords between vertices (edges or diagonals).

Step 2: Key property of rectangles inscribed in a circle.
- A rectangle inscribed in a circle has vertices that come in pairs of opposite points.
- The diagonals of the rectangle are diameters of the circle.

Step 3: Vertices of the rectangle.
- The rectangle&#39;s vertices must be four vertices of the dodecagon.
- Since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, its diagonals are diameters.
- Therefore, the rectangle&#39;s vertices must be pairs of opposite vertices on the circle.

Step 4: Find pairs of opposite vertices.
- The 12-gon has 12 vertices numbered 0 to 11.
- Opposite vertices are pairs separated by 6 steps (since 12/2 = 6).
- Opposite pairs: (0,6), (1,7), (2,8), (3,9), (4,10), (5,11).

Step 5: Construct rectangles from pairs of opposite vertices.
- A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices.
- For example, choosing (0,6) and (1,7) gives rectangle with vertices 0,1,6,7.
- The rectangle&#39;s sides are chords between these vertices.

Step 6: Count the rectangles.
- Number of opposite pairs = 6.
- Number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 = C(6,2) = 15.
- Each such choice corresponds to one unique rectangle.

Step 7: Verify that the sides lie on edges or diagonals of the dodecagon.
- Since the rectangle&#39;s vertices are vertices of the dodecagon, and the sides are chords between these vertices, each side is either an edge or a diagonal.
- So all such rectangles satisfy the problem&#39;s requirement.

Answer: 15 rectangles.
