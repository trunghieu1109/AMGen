    <pre>To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we start by labeling the vertices of the dodecagon as A_1, A_2, ..., A_12. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides. In a regular dodecagon, any line connecting two opposite vertices is a diagonal, and these diagonals can serve as sides of the rectangle. 

First, let&#39;s consider the number of ways to choose two opposite sides or diagonals. There are 12 sides in the dodecagon, and for each side, there is exactly one opposite side. Thus, there are 6 pairs of opposite sides.

Similarly, there are diagonals that connect opposite vertices. Each vertex is opposite to exactly one other vertex, and there are 6 such pairs of opposite vertices.

Therefore, there are 6 choices for the first pair of opposite sides (or diagonals) and 6 choices for the second pair of opposite sides (or diagonals), leading to a total of 6 x 6 = 36 rectangles.

However, this count includes rectangles that are not oriented along the sides of the dodecagon. To find only those rectangles whose sides lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, we need to consider the symmetry and structure of the dodecagon.

A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel lines from the dodecagon. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to exactly one other side, and each diagonal is parallel to exactly one other diagonal. There are 3 sets of parallel sides and 3 sets of parallel diagonals.

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel lines is given by the product of the number of parallel line sets for sides and diagonals.

Thus, the number of rectangles is 3 x 3 = 9.
