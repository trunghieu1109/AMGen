Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We need to count all rectangles whose sides lie along sides or diagonals of a fixed regular 12‐gon.  Equivalently, pick two parallel chords of one orientation and two parallel chords of the perpendicular orientation; their four intersections form a rectangle.  In a 12‐gon there are 6 possible “orientation” classes (diagonals of step size d or 12–d, for d=1,…,6) with sizes N₁,…,N₆ given by N₁=…=N₅=12 and N₆=6.  Perpendicular orientation pairs are (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), giving counts C(N₁,2)·C(N₄,2)+C(N₂,2)·C(N₅,2)+C(N₃,2)·C(N₆,2)=(66²)+(66²)+(66·15)=4356+4356+990=9702.
