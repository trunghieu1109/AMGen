    <pre>We want to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let&#39;s consider a four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Changing each digit to 1 gives us four conditions:
1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d is divisible by 7.
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d is divisible by 7.
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d is divisible by 7.
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 is divisible by 7.

We need to find the greatest such N. Start with N = 9999 and check if it satisfies the conditions.

1. 1999 is not divisible by 7.
2. 10999 is not divisible by 7.
3. 9999 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is not divisible by 7.

Since 9999 does not satisfy all conditions, try N = 9998.

1. 1998 is divisible by 7.
2. 10998 is divisible by 7.
3. 9998 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is not divisible by 7.

9998 does not satisfy all conditions. Try N = 9997.

1. 1997 is not divisible by 7.
2. 10997 is not divisible by 7.
3. 9997 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is not divisible by 7.

9997 does not satisfy all conditions. Try N = 9996.

1. 1996 is divisible by 7.
2. 10996 is not divisible by 7.
3. 9996 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is not divisible by 7.

9996 does not satisfy all conditions. Try N = 9995.

1. 1995 is not divisible by 7.
2. 10995 is divisible by 7.
3. 9995 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is not divisible by 7.

9995 does not satisfy all conditions. Try N = 9994.

1. 1994 is divisible by 7.
2. 10994 is not divisible by 7.
3. 9994 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is not divisible by 7.

9994 does not satisfy all conditions. Try N = 9993.

1. 1993 is not divisible by 7.
2. 10993 is divisible by 7.
3. 9993 is divisible by 7.
4. 9991 is divisible by 7.

9993 satisfies all conditions. Now, divide 9993 by 1000 to find Q and R: 9993 = 9 * 1000 + 993, so Q = 9 and R = 993. Therefore, Q + R = 9 + 993 = 1002.
