Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We seek the greatest 4‐digit N=abcd such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Writing congruences mod 7 for each replacement leads to:
N+1000(1−a)≡0, N+100(1−b)≡0, N+10(1−c)≡0, N+(1−d)≡0 (mod 7).
With 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3 (mod 7), these give N≡6(a−1)≡2(b−1)≡3(c−1)≡(d−1) (mod 7), and also N≡6a+2b+3c+d (mod 7).  Equating yields a≡5 (mod 7), so a=5.  Then b≡5−4a≡6, d≡2−a≡4, and c≡6+2a≡2 (mod 7), giving possible c=2 or 9; the larger choice c=9 maximizes N.  Thus N=5694.  Checking: replacing each digit by 1 gives 1694, 5194, 5614, 5691, all divisible by 7. Finally N=5·1000+694 so Q=5, R=694, and Q+R=699.
