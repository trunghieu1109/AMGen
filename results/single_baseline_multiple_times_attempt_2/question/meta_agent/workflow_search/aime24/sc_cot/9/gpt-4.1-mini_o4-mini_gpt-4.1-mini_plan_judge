Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, the total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4)=210. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her 4 chosen numbers match the drawn numbers, and wins the grand prize if all 4 match.

Count prize-winning outcomes:
- Exactly 2 matches: choose 2 of her 4 and 2 of the remaining 6 = C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90
- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24
- Exactly 4 matches (grand prize): 1
Total prize wins = 90+24+1 = 115

The probability of the grand prize given a prize win = 1/115; in lowest terms m=1, n=115, so m+n=1+115=116.

Answer:116
Extracted answer: 116
Correct answer: 116
