Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZIkQ', content="To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \\(|S| = 10\\). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers is \\(\\binom{10}{4}\\).\n\nNext, calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. Let's break it down:\n1. At least 2 of her numbers are chosen:\n   - Case 1: Exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen. There are \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) ways to choose 2 numbers from her 4 numbers, and \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\) ways to choose 2 numbers from the 6 remaining numbers in S.\n   - Case 2: Exactly 3 of her numbers are chosen. There are \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) ways to choose 3 numbers from her 4 numbers, and \\(\\binom{6}{1}\\) way to choose 1 number from the remaining numbers.\n   - Case 3: All 4 of her numbers are chosen. There is \\(\\binom{4}{4}\\) way to choose all 4 numbers.\n\nCalculate the total number of ways to win a prize:\n- Case 1: \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\binom{6}{2} = 6 \\cdot 15 = 90\\)\n- Case 2: \\(\\binom{4}{3} \\cdot \\binom{6}{1} = 4 \\cdot 6 = 24\\)\n- Case 3: \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nThe total number of ways to win a prize is \\(90 + 24 + 1 = 115\\).\n\nNext, calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize, which is just Case 3, where all 4 numbers are chosen: \\(1\\) way.\n\nThe probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win a prize: \\(\\frac{1}{115}\\).\n\nThus, \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 115\\), so \\(m+n = 1 + 115 = 116\\).\n\nAnswer:116", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
