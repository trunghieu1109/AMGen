    <pre>We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to the equations a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The first equation is a linear equation, and the second is a symmetric polynomial equation. We can start by considering the symmetry of the problem and the possible values of a, b, and c given the constraints. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers and they sum to 300, we can try to simplify the second equation by testing small values for one of the variables. Let&#39;s assume a &lt;= b &lt;= c for simplicity, which means a is likely smaller and we can test small values for a. After testing different values for a, we find that when a = 100, b = 100, and c = 100, the second equation holds true. Therefore, (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Due to the symmetry of the problem, this is the only solution because any permutation of (100, 100, 100) is the same triple. Thus, there is only one triple that satisfies both equations.
