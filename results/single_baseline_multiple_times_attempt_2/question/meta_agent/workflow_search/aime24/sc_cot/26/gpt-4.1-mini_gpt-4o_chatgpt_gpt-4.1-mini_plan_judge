Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set A and the sets B that Bob lists. Each set B is a nonempty finite set of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. If A contains the elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then Bob can form sets B for each a_i in A. The number of such sets B for a given a_i is 2^(a_i - 1), because any subset of {1, 2, ..., a_i} that includes a_i as the maximum element can be formed by choosing any subset of {1, 2, ..., a_i - 1} and adding a_i. So, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a_i - 1) for each a_i in A. We are given that this total number is 2024. We need to find the set A that satisfies this condition and then calculate the sum of its elements.
