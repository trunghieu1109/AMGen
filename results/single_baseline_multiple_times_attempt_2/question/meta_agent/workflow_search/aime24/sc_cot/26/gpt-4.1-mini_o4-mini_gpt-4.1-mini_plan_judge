Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Alice picks A of positive ints. Bob counts all nonempty finite B with max(B) in A. For each a in A, number of B with max=a is number of subsets of {1,…,a} containing a, i.e. 2^(a−1). So the total = sum_{a in A}2^(a−1)=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024=11111101000_2=2^10+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Thus the exponents a−1 are {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}, giving A={4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. Sum of A = 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.
