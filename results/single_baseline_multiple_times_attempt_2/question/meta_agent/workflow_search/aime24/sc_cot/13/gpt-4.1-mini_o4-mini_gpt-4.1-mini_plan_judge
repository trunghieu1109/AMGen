Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: First reinterpret the configuration:  eight equal circles of radius 34 are packed along side AC of triangle ABC, each tangent to AC and to its two neighbors, with the first circle also tangent to side AB and the last circle tangent to side BC.  Likewise 2024 circles of radius 1 fit the same way in the same triangle.

Place A=(0,0), C=(L,0), and let the center of the first r–circle be (t,r) and of the last be (t+2r·(n–1),r).  Tangency to AB gives t=r·cot(α/2), and tangency of the last circle to BC gives L–
(t+2r(n–1))=r·cot(γ/2), where α=∠A, γ=∠C.  Hence
  L=r[ cot(α/2) + (2(n–1)) + cot(γ/2) ].

For n=8, r=34:  L=34[ cot(α/2)+14+cot(γ/2) ].
For n=2024,r=1: L= cot(α/2)+4046+cot(γ/2).
Equate L:  34[X+14]=X+4046, with X=cot(α/2)+cot(γ/2).  =>33X=3570⇒X=1190/11.
Then from the 1–circle case L=(1190/11)+4046=45696/11.

But in any triangle the inradius r_in satisfies
  AC = L = r_in·[ cot(α/2)+cot(γ/2 ) ] = r_in·X.
Hence r_in = L/X = (45696/11)/(1190/11) =45696/1190 =192/5.
So m+n=192+5=197.
