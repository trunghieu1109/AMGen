Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent s00D', content='We want the unique point C on segment AB =[(1/2,0)→(0,√3/2)] that is not covered by any other unit‐length segment joining (p,0)→(0,q).  Parametrize points on AB by s∈[0,1]:\n  C(s) =((1−s)/2, s·√3/2).  For each θ∈(0,π/2), the segment from (cosθ,0) to (0,sinθ) meets AB at some s(θ).  One finds\n    s(θ)=sinθ(2cosθ−1)/(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ),\n  which is continuous except at θ=π/3.  As θ→π/3, s(θ)→3/4, and for θ≠π/3 one has s(θ)<3/4.  Thus the maximal s is 3/4, attained only in the limit by the segment θ=π/3, i.e. AB itself.  Hence C corresponds to s=3/4, namely\n    C=( (1−¾)/2, ¾·√3/2 )=(1/8, 3√3/8 ).\n  Then OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
