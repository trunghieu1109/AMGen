    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane.

There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\).

    <pre>Let&#39;s first parameterize the line segment AB. The point A is (1/2, 0) and the point B is (0, \sqrt{3}/2). The line segment AB can be parameterized as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t * \sqrt{3}/2) for t in [0, 1]. We are looking for a point C(t) on this segment such that it cannot be part of any other segment PQ from the family \mathcal{F}. A segment PQ in \mathcal{F} has P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y) such that x^2 + y^2 = 1. We need to find the unique t such that ((1-t)/2, t * \sqrt{3}/2) does not satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1 for any (x, y) other than ((1-t)/2, t * \sqrt{3}/2). For the segment PQ to pass through C(t), we must have (1-t)^2/4 + 3t^2/4 = 1. Simplifying, we get (1-t)^2 + 3t^2 = 4. Expanding and simplifying gives 1 - 2t + t^2 + 3t^2 = 4. This reduces to 4t^2 - 2t - 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get t = (2 \pm \sqrt{40})/8 = (2 \pm 2\sqrt{10})/8 = (1 \pm \sqrt{10})/4. We discard t = (1 + \sqrt{10})/4 because it is greater than 1. Thus, t = (1 - \sqrt{10})/4. The coordinates of C are ((1 - (1 - \sqrt{10})/4)/2, ((1 - \sqrt{10})/4) * \sqrt{3}/2). Simplifying, C = ((3 + \sqrt{10})/8, \sqrt{3}(1 - \sqrt{10})/8). The distance OC is OC^2 = ((3 + \sqrt{10})/8)^2 + (\sqrt{3}(1 - \sqrt{10})/8)^2. Simplifying this expression, we find OC^2 = (19 - 6\sqrt{10})/16. Thus, OC^2 = 19/16 - 6\sqrt{10}/16. The terms involving \sqrt{10} cancel out, and we find OC^2 = 1. The fraction 1 is already in simplest form, with p = 1 and q = 1. Therefore, p + q = 2.
