Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle 200, 240, and 300 suggest a 3-4-5 triangle scaled by 60. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 60.
