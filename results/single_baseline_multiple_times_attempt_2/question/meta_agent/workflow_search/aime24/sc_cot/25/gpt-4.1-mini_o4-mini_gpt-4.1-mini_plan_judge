Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We set up coordinates so that AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are vectors of length s in three directions u,v,w with opposite sides parallel: AB=s u, BC=s v, CD=s w, DE=−s u, EF=−s v, FA=−s w.  The three lines L1∥u (AB), L2∥w (CD), L3∥−v (EF) form a triangle whose side lengths along L1,L2,L3 are expressible in terms of s and the sines A=|u×v|, B=|v×w|, C=|w×u|.  By the law of sines in that triangle one finds L1:L2:L3=B:C:A and also from the side‐intersection calculations L1+sL2+sL3 are linked so that 1/s=(1/L1+1/L2+1/L3)/2.  Substituting L1=200, L2=240, L3=300 gives 1/s=(1/200+1/240+1/300)/2=0.0125/2=0.00625, hence s=160.
