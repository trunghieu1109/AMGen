Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We analyze the subtraction game with moves {1,4}.  Positions where the previous player wins (P-positions) occur exactly when n mod 5 is 0 or 2.  Since Alice starts, Bob wins exactly for those n.  Count positive n≤2024 with n≡0 or 2 mod5: there are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 and floor((2024-2)/5)+1=405 values ≡2 mod5.  Total=404+405=809.
