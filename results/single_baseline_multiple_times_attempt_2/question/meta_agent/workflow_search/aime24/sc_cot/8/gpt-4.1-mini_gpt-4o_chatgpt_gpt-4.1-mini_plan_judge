Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: We need to determine for which values of n Bob has a winning strategy. The key is to identify the losing positions, which are the positions where the current player cannot force a win. If n is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win. We start by analyzing small values of n:

1. n = 0: Alice cannot move, so she loses. 0 is a losing position.
2. n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. 1 is a winning position for Alice.
3. n = 2: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1, and wins on her next turn. 2 is winning for Alice.
4. n = 3: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2, and wins. 3 is winning for Alice.
5. n = 4: Alice takes 4 tokens and wins. 4 is winning for Alice.
6. n = 5: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4, which is winning for her. 5 is winning for Alice.

Now, consider n = 6:
- If Alice takes 1 token, leaving 5, Bob can win (since 5 is winning for Alice).
- If Alice takes 4 tokens, leaving 2, Bob can win (since 2 is winning for Alice).
Thus, 6 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Continuing this pattern, we find that every position that is 1 more than a multiple of 5 (i.e., n = 5k + 1) is a losing position for Alice, since she will leave a winning position for Bob. Thus, Bob can win if n is of the form 5k + 1.

We need to count the number of such n less than or equal to 2024.
The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020, so the numbers of the form 5k + 1 are 1, 6, 11, ..., 2021.

The sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 1 and common difference d = 5. We solve for the number of terms k:
5k + 1 <= 2024
5k <= 2023
k <= 404.6

The largest integer k is 404, so there are 404 such numbers.

Therefore, there are 405 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can win.
