Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to place the chips in such a way that all chips in any given row or column are of the same color, and we cannot place any additional chip without violating this condition. This implies that each row and each column is either fully filled with white chips, fully filled with black chips, or completely empty. Since there are 25 cells and 25 chips of each color, any row or column that is filled must be completely filled with chips of one color. Let's consider the number of rows filled with white chips as w and the number of rows filled with black chips as b. Similarly, let the number of columns filled with white chips be w' and the number of columns filled with black chips be b'. We must have w + b <= 5 and w' + b' <= 5. Also, the total number of white chips used is w * w' and the total number of black chips used is b * b'. We must have w * w' + b * b' = 25. The problem is symmetric in terms of rows and columns, so without loss of generality, let's consider w = w' and b = b'. This means we are looking for integer solutions to w^2 + b^2 = 25 with w + b <= 5. The possible integer pairs (w, b) that satisfy w^2 + b^2 = 25 are (5, 0) and (0, 5). For (w, b) = (5, 0), we have 5 rows and 5 columns filled with white chips, and for (w, b) = (0, 5), we have 5 rows and 5 columns filled with black chips. Each configuration corresponds to a unique way of filling the grid. Therefore, there are 2 ways to arrange the chips according to the given conditions.
