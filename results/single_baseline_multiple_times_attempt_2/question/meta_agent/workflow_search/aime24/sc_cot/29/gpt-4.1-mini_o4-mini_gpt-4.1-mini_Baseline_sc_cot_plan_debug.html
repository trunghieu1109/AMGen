    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We seek maximal placements of white/black chips on 5×5 grid so each row/column (if nonempty) is monochromatic and no empty cell can accept any chip without breaking monotonicity.  One shows that in any maximal configuration every row and every column must already be assigned a color (white or black), and then a cell is filled iff its row and column colors agree.  Conversely each of the 2^5 assignments of colors to rows and the 2^5 assignments to columns yields a unique maximal configuration.  Hence the total number is 2^5·2^5=2^10=1024.
