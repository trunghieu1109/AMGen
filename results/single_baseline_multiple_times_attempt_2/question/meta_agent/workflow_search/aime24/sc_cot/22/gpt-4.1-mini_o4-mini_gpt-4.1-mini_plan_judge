Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need a sorted list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9, and even length so median=(a_k+a_{k+1})/2 is integer M not in the list. Let f_9=m. Try m=2 so other sum=30-18=12, and total n=2+t must be even ⇒ t even. For t=2, pick two distinct positives x+y=12, x,y≠9. Possibilities: (5,7) gives list [5,7,9,9] with median=(7+9)/2=8, an integer not in the list. This satisfies all conditions. No other t works. Sum of squares: 5²+7²+9²+9²=25+49+81+81=236
