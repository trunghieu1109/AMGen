    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions. Let&#39;s denote the list as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \).

1. **Sum of the items is 30**: We have \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 30 \).

2. **Unique mode is 9**: This means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears \( k \) times where \( k \geq 2 \) (since it is the mode).

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: Since the median is not in the list, it must be between two numbers in the list. Since the sum is 30 and 9 is the mode, it is reasonable to assume a list with an odd number of elements for simplicity, \( n = 7 \), so the median is \( a_4 \).

Considering these, let&#39;s try to construct the list:

- Assume \( n = 7 \). Then the median \( a_4 \) is not in the list, and it must be an integer between two numbers in the list.
- Since 9 is the mode, let&#39;s assume 9 appears 3 times (\( a_5 = a_6 = a_7 = 9 \)).
- The sum of the list is 30, so the sum of the first four numbers is 30 - 27 = 3.

Let&#39;s try some combinations for the first four numbers:

- One possible combination is \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 1 \), so these add up to 3.
- Then the median \( a_4 \) must be 2 (since 2 is not in the list, and it is between 1 and 9).

Thus, the list is \( 1, 1, 1, 2, 9, 9, 9 \).

Now, let&#39;s calculate the sum of the squares:
- \( 1^2 = 1 \), and there are 3 of them, so \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \).
- \( 2^2 = 4 \).
- \( 9^2 = 81 \), and there are 3 of them, so \( 3 \times 81 = 243 \).

The sum of the squares is \( 3 + 4 + 243 = 250 \).
