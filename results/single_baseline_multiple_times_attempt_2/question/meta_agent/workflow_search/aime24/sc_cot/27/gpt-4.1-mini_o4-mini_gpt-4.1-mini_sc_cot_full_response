Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent abNj', content='We seek the largest 4‐digit N=1000a+100b+10c+d such that changing any one digit to 1 yields a multiple of 7.  Equivalently for each place i: N + (1−digit_i)·(10^i) ≡0 (mod 7).  Subtracting these congruences pairwise shows\n  a+2b≡3 (mod7),\n  c≡2a−1 (mod7),\n  d≡6a−5 (mod7),\nand also N≡6a−6 (mod7).  Plugging c,d into N≡6a−6 forces b≡a+1 (mod7) and then 3a+2≡3 ⇒3a≡1⇒a≡5 (mod7).  Thus a=5, b=6, d=4, and to maximize N we take c≡2·5−1=9 (mod7)⇒c=9.  Hence N=5694.  Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5, R=694, so Q+R=5+694=699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
