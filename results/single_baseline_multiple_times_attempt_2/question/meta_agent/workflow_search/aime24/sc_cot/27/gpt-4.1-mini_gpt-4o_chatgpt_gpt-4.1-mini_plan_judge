Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and work backwards. For each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), we change the digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7. We need to ensure that the resulting number is divisible by 7 in each case. We test numbers less than 9999 until we find such an N. Once found, we divide N by 1000 to find the quotient Q and remainder R, then compute Q+R.
