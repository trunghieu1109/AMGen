Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Ymud', content='We note that any rectangle whose vertices are chosen among the 12 vertices and whose edges lie along polygon sides or diagonals must be a cyclic rectangle inscribed in the same circumcircle. In a cyclic rectangle the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at the center of the circle, hence each diagonal is a diameter of the circle. Thus every such rectangle corresponds to a choice of two distinct diameters of the 12-gon. There are 12 vertices giving 6 distinct diameters (pairs of antipodal vertices), and choosing any 2 of these 6 diameters gives one rectangle. Hence the total number is C(6,2)=15.\n\nAnswer:15', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
