Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9lFw', content='To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we first need to consider its properties. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices and 12 sides. Each vertex is connected to every other vertex, forming a complete graph with 12 vertices. A rectangle within this dodecagon must have its sides parallel to each other, and opposite sides must be equal in length. We can form a rectangle by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, pairs of parallel sides can be found by considering diagonals that are opposite each other. For a dodecagon, we can choose two parallel sides from any of the following pairs of opposite diagonals: (1, 7), (2, 8), (3, 9), (4, 10), (5, 11), and (6, 12). Each pair of opposite diagonals can be combined with any other pair of opposite diagonals to form a rectangle. Therefore, the number of ways to choose two pairs of diagonals from 6 pairs is given by the combination formula C(6, 2).\n\nAnswer:15', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
