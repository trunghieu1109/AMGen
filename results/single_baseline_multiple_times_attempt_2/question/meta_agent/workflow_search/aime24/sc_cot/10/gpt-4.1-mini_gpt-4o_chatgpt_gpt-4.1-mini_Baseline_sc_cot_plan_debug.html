    <pre>We are given two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with certain conditions. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, A, D, H, and G lie on a circle, indicating cyclic points. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can consider the line segment DECF. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, opposite sides are equal and parallel. We are given BC = 16 and AB = 107 for rectangle ABCD, and FG = 17 and EF = 184 for rectangle EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear and we need CE, we can use the fact that CE is the horizontal distance between C and E. Given the configuration and the fact that rectangles have parallel sides, we can calculate CE using the given side lengths. Since BC is 16 and FG is 17, the horizontal distance between C and E, which is CE, will be the sum of these two side lengths.
