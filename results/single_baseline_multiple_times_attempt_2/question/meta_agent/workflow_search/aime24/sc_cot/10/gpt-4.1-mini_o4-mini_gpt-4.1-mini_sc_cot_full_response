Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent NY1e', content='Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). The collinear points D,E,C,F lie on y=16 and EF=184, so let E=(e,16), F=(e+184,16). Rectangle EFGH gives G=(e+184,33), H=(e,33). A,D,H,G concyclic implies their circumcenter lies on the perp. bisector of AD, i.e. y=8, at (h,8), with equal distances to A and to H and G. Solving (e-h)^2+25^2 = h^2+8^2 and ((e+184)-h)^2+25^2 = h^2+8^2 yields e-h = -92 and h^2=9025, so h=95, e=95-92=3. Hence C=(107,16), E=(3,16) and CE=107-3=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
