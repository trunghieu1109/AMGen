Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We need points A and B on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 =1 such that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals through the origin. Opposite vertices satisfy C=–A, D=–B, and side equality gives |A–B|=|A+B|, which implies A·B=0. Parameterize A=(√20 cosh t1,√24 sinh t1), B=(√20 cosh t2,√24 sinh t2). Orthogonality gives tanh t1·tanh t2=–5/6. The BD diagonal squared is 4|B|^2 =4(20 cosh^2 t2+24 sinh^2 t2)=80+176 sinh^2 t2. Writing u=tanh^2 t2 gives BD^2=80+176 u/(1–u) and the constraint yields u in (25/36,1). This expression decreases as u→25/36, giving infimum BD^2→80+176·(25/36)/(11/36)=480. Since that is never attained by any finite rhombus, for all rhombi BD^2>480, so the greatest number less than BD^2 for every rhombus is 480.
