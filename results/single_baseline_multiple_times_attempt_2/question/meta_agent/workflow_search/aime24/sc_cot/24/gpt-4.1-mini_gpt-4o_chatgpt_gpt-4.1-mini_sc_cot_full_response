Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent b9tr', content="We are given three equations involving logarithms with base 2 and must find the value of |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|. Let's start by converting each equation to exponential form.\\n\\nThe first equation is log_2(x / yz) = 1/2. This means x / yz = 2^(1/2), or x = yz * sqrt(2).\\n\\nThe second equation is log_2(y / xz) = 1/3. This means y / xz = 2^(1/3), or y = xz * 2^(1/3).\\n\\nThe third equation is log_2(z / xy) = 1/4. This means z / xy = 2^(1/4), or z = xy * 2^(1/4).\\n\\nNow, let's multiply all three equations: (x = yz * sqrt(2)) * (y = xz * 2^(1/3)) * (z = xy * 2^(1/4)).\\n\\nThis gives us x * y * z = (yz * sqrt(2)) * (xz * 2^(1/3)) * (xy * 2^(1/4)).\\n\\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we have x * y * z = x^2 * y^2 * z^2 * sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4).\\n\\nThus, 1 = x * y * z = x^2 * y^2 * z^2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4).\\n\\nThe exponents of 2 add up to 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.\\n\\nTherefore, x^2 * y^2 * z^2 = 2^(-13/12).\\n\\nNow, we need to find |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|.\\n\\nWe know x^4 = (x^2)^2, y^3 = (y^2)^(3/2), and z^2 is z^2.\\n\\nThus, x^4 * y^3 * z^2 = (x^2)^2 * (y^2)^(3/2) * z^2.\\n\\nWe have x^2 * y^2 * z^2 = 2^(-13/12), so (x^2)^2 * (y^2)^(3/2) * z^2 = (2^(-13/12))^4/3.\\n\\nThat is, x^4 * y^3 * z^2 = 2^(-13/12 * 4/3) = 2^(-13/9).\\n\\nThus, log_2(x^4 * y^3 * z^2) = -13/9.\\n\\nTherefore, |log_2(x^4 * y^3 * z^2)| = 13/9.\\n\\nNow, we find m+n for m/n = 13/9. m = 13, n = 9, so m+n = 13+9.\n\nAnswer:22", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
