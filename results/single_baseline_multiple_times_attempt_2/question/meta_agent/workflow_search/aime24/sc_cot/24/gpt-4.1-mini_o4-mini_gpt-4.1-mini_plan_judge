Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We set A=log2 x, B=log2 y, C=log2 z. The system becomes
A−B−C=1/2,
−A+B−C=1/3,
−A−B+C=1/4.
Summing gives −(A+B+C)=13/12 ⇒A+B+C=−13/12.
From A−B−C=1/2 we get A=1/2+B+C. Plug into sum to get B+C=−19/24 ⇒A=−7/24.
Then from −A+B−C=1/3 ⇒B−C=1/24. Solve with B+C=−19/24 to get B=−3/8, C=−5/12.
Now log2(x^4y^3z^2)=4A+3B+2C=−75/24=−25/8, so its absolute value is 25/8. Thus m+n=25+8=33.
