Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To determine if a number n is b-eautiful, we need to express n in base b as a two-digit number, say \( 	ext{AB}_b \), where A and B are digits such that \( A < b \) and \( B < b \). The number n is then \( n = A 	imes b + B \). For n to be b-eautiful, the sum of its digits in base b, A + B, must equal \( \sqrt{n} \). We need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 integers n that satisfy these conditions. Let's calculate for bases starting from b = 2.
