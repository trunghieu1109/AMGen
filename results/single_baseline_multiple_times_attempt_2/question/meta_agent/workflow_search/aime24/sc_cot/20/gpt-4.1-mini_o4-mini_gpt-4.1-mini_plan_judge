Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We seek b –beautiful n iff in base b, digits a,c satisfy a𝑏+c=(a+c)² with a≥1,c≥0,b>max(a,c). Let k=a+c so n=k² and k∈[1,b−1]. From a𝐛+c=k² ⇒ k𝐛−k²=c(𝐛−1) ⇒ k(k−1)≡0 mod(b−1). Solutions k∈[2,b−1] correspond to k(k−1)≡0 modD with D=b−1, excluding k=1. The count of solutions is 2^ω(D)−1, where ω(D)=number of distinct prime factors of D. We require 2^ω−1>10 ⇒2^ω>11 ⇒ω≥4. The smallest D with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=D+1=211 is minimal.
