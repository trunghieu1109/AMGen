Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent j4c7', content="To determine if a number n is b-eautiful, we need to express n in base b as a two-digit number, say \\( \text{AB}_b \\), where A and B are digits such that \\( A < b \\) and \\( B < b \\). The number n is then \\( n = A \times b + B \\). For n to be b-eautiful, the sum of its digits in base b, A + B, must equal \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). We need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 integers n that satisfy these conditions. Let's calculate for bases starting from b = 2.\n\nAnswer:14", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
