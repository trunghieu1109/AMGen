Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent z2kW', content='We set u=|sin(2πx)| and v=|cos(3πy)|.  Then y=H(x)=4|\u2009|u−0.5|−0.25\u2009| and x=K(y)=4|\u2009|v−0.5|−0.25\u2009|.  One checks that the only simultaneous solution in [0,1]×[0,1] is x=y=1, and periodicity simply repeats this single intersection.  Thus there is exactly one intersection point (modulo integer‐period translations).\n\nAnswer:1', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
