Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: We start by analyzing the functions involved. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a piecewise function that reflects around x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, resulting in a V-shape with vertex at x = 1/2. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is another piecewise function with a V-shape, but with vertex at x = 1/4. The function sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1 over the interval [0, 1]. The composite function f(sin(2πx)) will produce values based on the distance of |sin(2πx)| from 1/2. Similarly, f(cos(3πy)) will produce values based on the distance of |cos(3πy)| from 1/2. The functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) transform these values further by applying g and then scaling by 4. We need to find the intersections of these two graphs, which means finding (x, y) such that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y. To find the number of intersections, we notice that both functions depend on the periodic trigonometric functions and the piecewise linear functions f and g. The critical points occur at the zeros and endpoints of the periods of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which are multiples of 1/2 and 1/3, respectively. By analyzing these critical points, we determine that the graphs intersect at discrete points within the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1].
