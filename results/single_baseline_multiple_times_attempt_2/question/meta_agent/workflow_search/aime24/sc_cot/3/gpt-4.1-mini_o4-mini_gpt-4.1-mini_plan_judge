Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: We set u=|sin(2πx)| and v=|cos(3πy)|.  Then y=H(x)=4| |u−0.5|−0.25 | and x=K(y)=4| |v−0.5|−0.25 |.  One checks that the only simultaneous solution in [0,1]×[0,1] is x=y=1, and periodicity simply repeats this single intersection.  Thus there is exactly one intersection point (modulo integer‐period translations).
