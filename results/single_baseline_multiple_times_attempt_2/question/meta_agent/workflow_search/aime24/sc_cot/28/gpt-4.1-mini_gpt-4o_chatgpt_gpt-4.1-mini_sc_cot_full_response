Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2Ehh', content="To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is internally and externally tangent to the sphere. We start by understanding the geometry of the torus. The circle generating the torus has radius 3, and it revolves around an axis 6 units away from its center, giving the torus a 'major radius' of 6 and a 'minor radius' of 3. The center of the torus is thus 6 units from the axis of revolution. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_o, is the difference between this distance and the minor radius of the torus (3): r_o = 17 - 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_i, is the sum of this distance and the minor radius of the torus (3): r_i = 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o is 8 - 14 = -6. We express this as a fraction: -6 = \\frac{-6}{1}. The relatively prime integers are m = -6 and n = 1, and their sum is m + n = -6 + 1 = -5. However, since we are asked for positive integers, we interpret m and n as 6 and 1, respectively, giving m + n = 7.\n\nAnswer:7", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
