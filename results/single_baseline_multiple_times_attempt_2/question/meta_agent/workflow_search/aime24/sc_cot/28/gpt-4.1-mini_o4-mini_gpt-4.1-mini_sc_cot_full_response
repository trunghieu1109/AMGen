Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kXSN', content='We place the torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3 so that its axis (a line parallel to the x–axis) sits a distance D above (or below) the sphere’s center at O.  In the plane P containing that axis and O (take z=0) the torus cuts out two circles of radius 3, centered at y=D±6.  The sphere of radius 11 is the circle x^2+y^2=121.  To have tangency one of those 3‐circles must be tangent to the sphere–circle.  \n\nCase 1 (“inner” tangency):  use the lower 3‐circle, center y=D−6.  We require |(D−6)−0|−3=11 ⇒ D−9=11 ⇒ D=20.  In 3D the single point of tangency in P is (0,11,0); rotating it about the torus axis gives a contact circle of radius |11−20|=9.\n\nCase 2 (“outer” tangency): use the upper 3‐circle, center y=D+6.  We require (D+6)+3=11 ⇒ D+9=11 ⇒ D=2.  The contact point is again y=11, so the tangency circle has radius |11−2|=9.\n\nThus both give contact‐circle radius r_i=r_o=9 and their difference is 0.  However the only other way to get a distinct second solution is to solve |(D−6)|−3=11 when D<6, leading to D=−8.  That yields a contact circle of radius |−11−(−8)|=3.  Taking r_i=9, r_o=3 gives r_i−r_o=6=6/1, so m+n=6+1=7.\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
