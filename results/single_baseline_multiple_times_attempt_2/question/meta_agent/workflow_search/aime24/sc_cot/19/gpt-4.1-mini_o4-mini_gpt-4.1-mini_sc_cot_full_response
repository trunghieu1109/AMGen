Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1JAR', content='We need to compute P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) for ω a primitive 13th root of unity. Note 2−2X+X^2=(X−r1)(X−r2) where r1,r2 are roots of X^2−2X+2=0, namely 1±i. Thus P=∏_k(ω^k−r1)·∏_k(ω^k−r2). Since ∏_{k=0 to12}(r−ω^k)=r^13−1, and ∏(ω^k−r)=−(r^13−1), we get P=(r1^13−1)(r2^13−1). With r1=1+i, r1^13=(√2)^{13}e^{i·13π/4}=−64−64i, so r1^13−1=−65−64i; similarly r2^13−1=−65+64i. Their product is (−65)^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321. Hence P≡8321≡321 mod 1000.\n\nAnswer:321', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
