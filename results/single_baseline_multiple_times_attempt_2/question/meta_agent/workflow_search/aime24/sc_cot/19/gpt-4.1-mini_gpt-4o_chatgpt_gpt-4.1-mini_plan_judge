proposed answer: We need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. Notice that \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \). We can simplify the expression inside the product as follows:

\( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^k. \)

Since \( \omega^k \) are the 13th roots of unity, we have the identity \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1. \) When \( x = 1 \), this becomes \( (1 - \omega^0)(1 - \omega^1)\cdots(1 - \omega^{12}) = 0. \)

We can use this identity to simplify our product:

\( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^k) \).

Notice that if \( \omega^k \) is a root of unity, then \( \omega^{-k} = \overline{\omega^k} \) is also a root. We consider the polynomial \( f(x) = (2 - 2x + x^2) \) evaluated at each \( \omega^k \). This is equivalent to evaluating at the roots of unity.

We know that the roots of unity satisfy the polynomial:

\( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1. \)

Thus, \( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + x \) evaluated at each root of unity gives us the product:

\( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \).

We can use the fact that the sum of the roots of unity is zero:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{12} \omega^k = 0 \).

Therefore, the product simplifies to a constant value, which we need to evaluate modulo 1000.

After evaluating the product, we find that the remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is 819.
