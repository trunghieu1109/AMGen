\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: We need to compute P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) for ω a primitive 13th root of unity. Note 2−2X+X^2=(X−r1)(X−r2) where r1,r2 are roots of X^2−2X+2=0, namely 1±i. Thus P=∏_k(ω^k−r1)·∏_k(ω^k−r2). Since ∏_{k=0 to12}(r−ω^k)=r^13−1, and ∏(ω^k−r)=−(r^13−1), we get P=(r1^13−1)(r2^13−1). With r1=1+i, r1^13=(√2)^{13}e^{i·13π/4}=−64−64i, so r1^13−1=−65−64i; similarly r2^13−1=−65+64i. Their product is (−65)^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321. Hence P≡8321≡321 mod 1000.
