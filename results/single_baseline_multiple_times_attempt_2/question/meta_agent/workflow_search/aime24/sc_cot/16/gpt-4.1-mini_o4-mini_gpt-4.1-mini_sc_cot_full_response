Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent WFlb', content='We know R=13, r=6, so by Euler’s formula OI^2=R(R−2r)=13·1=13, hence OI=√13. Given IA⊥OI, triangle OIA is right at I, so IA^2=OA^2−OI^2=13^2−13=169−13=156, giving IA=√156. But also IA=r/sin(A/2), so sin(A/2)=r/IA=6/√156=√(3/13), giving cosA=1−2sin^2(A/2)=7/13 and sinA=2sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2√30/13. Then a=BC=2R sinA=4√30. Let x=bc. Using area twice: bc sinA=2Δ=2rs= r(a+b+c)*2? Actually bc sinA=2Δ=2rs=2r·(a+b+c)/2=r(a+b+c)→b+c=(x sinA/r)−a. Law of cosines: a^2=b^2+c^2−2bc cosA= (b+c)^2−2x−2x cosA. Substituting b+c and simplifying yields x=468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
