proposed answer: Given that \( \triangle ABC \) has circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \) with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find \( AB \cdot AC \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the excenter of the excircle opposite \( A \). We can use the identity \( R^2 - 2Rr = AI^2 \) when \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Plugging in the given values, we have: \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \). Therefore, \( R^2 = 169 \) and \( 2Rr = 2 \times 13 \times 6 = 156 \). Thus, \( AI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13 \). Next, we use the formula \( AI^2 = bc \left( 1 - \frac{a^2}{(b+c)^2} \right) \) where \( a = BC, b = CA, c = AB \). Since \( AI^2 = 13 \), we have \( bc \left( 1 - \frac{a^2}{(b+c)^2} \right) = 13 \). The task is to find \( bc \). We also have the relation \( abc = 4RrK \) where \( K \) is the area of the triangle. Using \( K = rs \) where \( s \) is the semiperimeter, we get \( abc = 4 \times 13 \times 6 \times \frac{6s}{s} = 312s \). However, we need \( bc \) directly. Using the identity \( AI^2 = bc \left( 1 - \frac{a^2}{(b+c)^2} \right) = 13 \), we can simplify this as \( bc = \frac{13}{1 - \frac{a^2}{(b+c)^2}} \). Since \( a \) is not directly given, we use another approach: \( bc = 4Rr \cos A \) when \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Since \( \cos A = \frac{r}{R} = \frac{6}{13} \), we have \( bc = 4 \times 13 \times 6 \times \frac{6}{13} = 144 \). Therefore, \( AB \cdot AC = 144 \).
