Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We want the smallest sphere radius r so that for each box (with dimensions x,y,z positive) of surface area 54 and volume 23, the box can be inscribed in a sphere of radius r.  Such a sphere has radius half the space‐diagonal, D=
√(x^2+y^2+z^2), so r = (1/2)max_{B} √(x^2+y^2+z^2).  Equivalently r^2 = (1/4)·max f where f=x^2+y^2+z^2 subject to xy+yz+zx=27 and xyz=23.

By symmetry there is a local extremum when two dimensions are equal: set y=z.  Then from 2xy+y^2=27 and xy^2=23 one finds y=2, x=23/4, which gives f = (23/4)^2+2·2^2 =657/16.  Checking the boundary (where the quadratic for y,z becomes degenerate) shows that at those endpoints f is smaller; as x→0 or ∞ there are no real y,z solutions because the discriminant of the quadratic in y becomes negative.  Hence the global maximum of f on the feasible set is f=657/16, so r^2=(657/16)/4=657/64.  In lowest terms p=657, q=64, and p+q=721.
