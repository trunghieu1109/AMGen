Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The surface area condition gives $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$, so $xy + yz + zx = 27$. The volume condition gives $xyz = 23$. To find the smallest sphere that can contain the box, we need the diagonal of the box, which is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. The radius $r$ of the sphere is half the diagonal, so $r = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. We need to minimize $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. Using the identity $(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)$, we have $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)$. Let $s = x+y+z$. Then $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54$. To find $s$, we use $t^3 - st^2 + 27t - 23 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, $s$ is the sum of the roots. We need to minimize $s^2 - 54$. After testing possible values, we find $x = 1$, $y = \frac{23}{3}$, $z = \frac{23}{3}$ works, giving $s = \frac{49}{3}$. Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2401}{9} - 54 = \frac{37}{9}$. Hence, $r^2 = \frac{37}{36}$. Thus, $p = 37$ and $q = 36$, making $p+q = 73$.
