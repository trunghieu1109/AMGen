Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We have paths of 16 steps with 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). Exactly four direction changes means the path has 5 runs (segments of consecutive identical moves). Runs alternate R and U, and can start with R or U.

Case 1: Start with R. Then we have 3 R‐runs (runs 1,3,5) totaling 8 R’s, and 2 U‐runs (runs 2,4) totaling 8 U’s. The number of compositions of 8 into 3 positive parts is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21; into 2 parts is C(7,1)=7. So this case yields 21×7=147 paths.

Case 2: Start with U. Similarly gives 21×7=147 paths.

Total = 147+147 = 294.
