    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider paths on an 8x8 grid that start at (0,0) and end at (8,8), using exactly 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. The total length of the path is 16 moves. We want paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change in direction occurs when an R move is followed by a U move or vice versa. To have exactly 4 changes in direction, the path can be broken into 5 segments, where each segment consists of consecutive R moves or consecutive U moves. We can represent the path as a sequence of segments: (R^a, U^b, R^c, U^d, R^e), where a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, and a, b, c, d, e &gt; 0. This means we have 4 changes in direction (R to U or U to R) between these segments. The number of such paths is the number of solutions to this equation with positive integer values, which is a combinatorial problem. We use the stars and bars method to count the ways to partition 8 R&#39;s into 3 positive parts and 8 U&#39;s into 2 positive parts. For R&#39;s, the number of partitions is \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} \). For U&#39;s, the number of partitions is \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} \). The total number of paths is the product of these two numbers.
