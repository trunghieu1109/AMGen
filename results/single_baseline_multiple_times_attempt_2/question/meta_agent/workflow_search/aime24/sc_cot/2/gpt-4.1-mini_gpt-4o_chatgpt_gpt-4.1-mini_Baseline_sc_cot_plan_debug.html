    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we consider the symmetry of the regular octagon and the coloring of its vertices. Each vertex can be colored red or blue independently with a probability of 1/2. We want to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. 

First, note that there are 8 vertices and 8 possible rotations (including the identity rotation). For a given coloring, we need to check if there is at least one rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. 

We can use Burnside&#39;s Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings that satisfy this condition. According to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each rotation.

1. Identity rotation: All 2^8 colorings are fixed.
2. 45-degree rotations (8-cycle): For a coloring to be fixed, all vertices must be the same color. There are 2 such colorings (all red or all blue).
3. 90-degree rotations (4-cycle): Vertices 1, 3, 5, 7 must be the same color and vertices 2, 4, 6, 8 must be the same color. There are 2*2 = 4 such colorings.
4. 135-degree rotations (8-cycle): Same as 45-degree rotations, 2 fixed colorings.
5. 180-degree rotations (2 4-cycles): Vertices 1, 5 and 3, 7 and 2, 6 and 4, 8 must be the same color. There are 2^4 = 16 such colorings.
6. 225-degree rotations (8-cycle): Same as 45-degree rotations, 2 fixed colorings.
7. 270-degree rotations (4-cycle): Same as 90-degree rotations, 4 fixed colorings.
8. 315-degree rotations (8-cycle): Same as 45-degree rotations, 2 fixed colorings.

Calculating the average: (256 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 4 + 2) / 8 = 288 / 8 = 36.

There are 2^8 = 256 total colorings. The probability that a coloring can be rotated to map all blue vertices to where red vertices were is 36/256 = 9/64.

Thus, the probability is 9/64, and m+n = 9+64 = 73.
