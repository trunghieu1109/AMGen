Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We seek the probability that a random red/blue coloring of the 8 vertices admits a rotation sending every blue to a red.  Equivalently, for the blue‐set B⊆ℤ/8, there is k with B∩(B+k)=∅.  We find that for sizes w≠4, such a k always exists, so all B of size 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8 are “good.”  The only “bad” sets are those of size 4 whose pairwise differences cover {1,2,3,4}, and there are 52 such 4‐subsets.  Hence #good=256−52=204, probability=204/256=51/64 so m+n=51+64=115.
