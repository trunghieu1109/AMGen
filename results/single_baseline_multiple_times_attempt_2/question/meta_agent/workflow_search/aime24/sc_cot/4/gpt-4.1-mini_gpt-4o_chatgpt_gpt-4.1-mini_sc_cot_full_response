Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent A5Dx', content='To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by considering the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2). So, n must have an order of 8 modulo p^2, meaning the multiplicative order of n modulo p^2 divides 8. Therefore, n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) suggests that n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2) while n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means that -1 must be a quadratic residue mod p^2, or equivalently, there must be a solution to x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For small primes, we find that p = 5 works. Now, for p = 5, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. We check small values of m and find that m = 3 works because 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, and 82 is divisible by 25.\n\nAnswer:3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
