proposed answer: To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by considering the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2). So, n must have an order of 8 modulo p^2, meaning the multiplicative order of n modulo p^2 divides 8. Therefore, n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) suggests that n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2) while n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means that -1 must be a quadratic residue mod p^2, or equivalently, there must be a solution to x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For small primes, we find that p = 5 works. Now, for p = 5, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. We check small values of m and find that m = 3 works because 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, and 82 is divisible by 25.
