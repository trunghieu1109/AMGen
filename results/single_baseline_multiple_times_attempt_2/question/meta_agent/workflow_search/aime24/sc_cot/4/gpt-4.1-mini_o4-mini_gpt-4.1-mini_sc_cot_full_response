Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent EodG', content='We seek the smallest prime p for which some n yields p^2 | n^4+1. Check small p≡1 mod4: p=5 fails, p=13 fails, p=17 works (n^4≡−1 mod17 has solutions ±2,±8 and Hensel lifts to mod17^2 exist). Thus p=17. To find the least m>0 with m^4+1 divisible by17^2=289, we lift each solution n0∈{2,15,8,9} mod17 to n=n0+17t mod289. Writing f(n0)=n0^4+1=17 (so a=1) and f′(n0)=4n0^3, we solve a+4n0^3 t≡0 mod17 for t. For n0=2→t=9→n=155; 15→t=8→n=151; 8→t=2→n=42; 9→t=15→n=264. The smallest is 42.\n\nAnswer:42', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
