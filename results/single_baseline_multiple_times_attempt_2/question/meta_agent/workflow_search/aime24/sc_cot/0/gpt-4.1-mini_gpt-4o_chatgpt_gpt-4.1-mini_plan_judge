Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first need to determine Aya's walking speed, s, and the time she spends in the coffee shop, t. We have two scenarios: 
1. Walking at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours (including t minutes at the coffee shop). 
2. Walking at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (including t minutes at the coffee shop). 

From scenario 1, the walking time is 4 hours or 240 minutes minus t minutes in the coffee shop, which gives us a walking time of (240 - t) minutes. The distance is 9 km, so the equation is: 
9 = s * ((240 - t) / 60).

From scenario 2, the walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes or 144 minutes minus t minutes in the coffee shop, which gives us a walking time of (144 - t) minutes. The distance is still 9 km, so the equation is: 
9 = (s + 2) * ((144 - t) / 60).

We have two equations: 
1. 9 = s * ((240 - t) / 60)
2. 9 = (s + 2) * ((144 - t) / 60)

Solving equation 1 for s gives us: 
s = (9 * 60) / (240 - t) = 540 / (240 - t).

Substituting this expression for s into equation 2 gives us: 
9 = ((540 / (240 - t)) + 2) * ((144 - t) / 60).

Simplifying, we get: 
540 = (540 + 2(240 - t)) * ((144 - t) / (240 - t)).

Further simplification gives us: 
540 = (540 + 480 - 2t) * ((144 - t) / (240 - t)).

Expanding and simplifying, we find that t = 60 minutes.

Now, we can find s using t = 60 in the equation for s: 
s = 540 / (240 - 60) = 540 / 180 = 3 km/h.

Finally, if Aya walks at s + 0.5 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9 / 3.5 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
(9 / 3.5) * 60 = 154.2857 minutes.

Including the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is:
154.2857 + 60 = 214.2857 minutes.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total time is 214 minutes.
