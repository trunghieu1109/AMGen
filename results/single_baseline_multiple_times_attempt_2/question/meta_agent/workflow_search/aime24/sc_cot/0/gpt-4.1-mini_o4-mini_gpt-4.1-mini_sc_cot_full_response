Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FwPD', content='Let walking time + coffee time satisfy:\n(1) 9/s + t/60 = 4\n(2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\nSubtract: 9/(s+2) − 9/s = −1.6 → 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 → s(s+2)=11.25 → s=2.5 km/h. Then t=60(4−9/2.5)=24 min. At speed s+0.5=3 km/h walking time=9/3=3 h=180 min, plus 24 min coffee=204 min.\n\nAnswer:204', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
