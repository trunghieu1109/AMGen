Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We label the grid as
 a b c
 d e f

Row‐sums condition: (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999 ⇒ 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999 ⇒ a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9.
Column‐sums: (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99.
But a+d=9, etc ⇒ total sum S=a+b+c+d+e+f=27. Let T=a+b+c. Then column‐sum=10T+(S−T)=9T+S=9T+27=99 ⇒ 9T=72 ⇒ T=8.
Thus pick nonnegative digits a,b,c with a+b+c=8 (each ≤9 automatically), and set d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c. The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
