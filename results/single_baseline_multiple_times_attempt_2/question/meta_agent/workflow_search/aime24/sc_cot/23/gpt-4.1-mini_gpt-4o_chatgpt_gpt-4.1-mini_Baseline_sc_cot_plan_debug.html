    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the 2x3 grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array}
\]
The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. This means:
\[100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\]
The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. This means:
\[a + d = 9\]
\[b + e = 9\]
\[c + f = 9\]
Now, let&#39;s solve these equations:
1. From the condition \(a + d = 9\), we can have pairs: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0).
2. From the condition \(b + e = 9\), we can have the same pairs as above.
3. From the condition \(c + f = 9\), we can have the same pairs as above.

Each pair can be chosen independently, so for each of the three sums, there are 10 possibilities.

Thus, the total number of ways to fill the grid is:
\[10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000\]
However, let&#39;s verify that all these combinations satisfy the sum condition 999:

The equation \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\) can be rewritten using the conditions \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), \(c + f = 9\):
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 100 \times 9 + 10 \times 9 + 9 = 999
\]
This equation is satisfied for all combinations of (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f) that satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the number of ways to fill the grid is 1000.
