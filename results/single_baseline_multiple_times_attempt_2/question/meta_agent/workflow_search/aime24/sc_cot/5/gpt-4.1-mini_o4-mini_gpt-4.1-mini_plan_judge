Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We recognize that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid (all pairs of opposite edges equal), so all four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41, √80, √89.  First compute the area T of one face by Heron’s‐type formula: if a^2=41, b^2=80, c^2=89 then
 16T^2 = 2(ab)^2+2(bc)^2+2(ca)^2−(a^4+b^4+c^4)
 =2(41·80+80·89+89·41)−(41^2+80^2+89^2)
 =28098−16002=12096
 so T^2=756 and T=6√21.  Hence total surface area S=4T=24√21.

Next place face ABC in the plane to find the height h from D to that plane via coordinates.  One finds
 h = 3280/(123√21)
 and therefore the volume V = (1/3)T·h = (6√21/3)·(3280/(123√21)) = 2·(3280/123) = 6560/123.
 But the inradius r satisfies V = r·S/3, so r = 3V/S = (3·6560/123)/(24√21) = (6560/41)/(24√21) = (160/3)/(24√21) =20/(3√21) =20√21/63.

Thus inradius = (20√21)/63, so (m,n,p)=(20,21,63) and m+n+p=20+21+63=104.
