Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hYoJ', content='We are given the following information: Total residents = 900. Diamond ring owners = 195, golf clubs owners = 367, garden spade owners = 562, and everyone owns candy hearts. 437 own exactly two of these (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), and 234 own exactly three of these. We need to find how many own all four. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have: Total = 195 + 367 + 562 - (number owning exactly two) + (number owning exactly three) - (number owning all four). Substituting the known values gives: 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + 234 - x. Solving for x, we find x = 21.\n\nAnswer:21', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
