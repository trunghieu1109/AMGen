Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent yjgb', content='We set up the equations: log_x(y^x)=10 gives x·ln y=10 ln x, and log_y(x^{4y})=10 gives 4y·ln x=10 ln y. Multiply them: (x ln y)(4y ln x)=100 ln x ln y, so 4xy=100 ⇒ xy=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
