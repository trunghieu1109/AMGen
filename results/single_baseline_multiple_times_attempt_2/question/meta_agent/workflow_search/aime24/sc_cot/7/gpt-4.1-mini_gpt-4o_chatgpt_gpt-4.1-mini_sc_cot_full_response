Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hpAo', content='We start by analyzing the given logarithmic equations: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\).\n\nFor the first equation, \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) means \\( x^{10} = y^x \\). Therefore, \\( y = x^{10/x} \\).\n\nFor the second equation, \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\) means \\( y^{10} = x^{4y} \\). Therefore, \\( x = y^{10/(4y)} \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( y = x^{10/x} \\) into the second equation: \\( x = (x^{10/x})^{10/(4x^{10/x})} \\).\n\nSimplifying gives \\( x = x^{100/(4x)} \\), which simplifies to \\( x = x^{25/x} \\).\n\nSince both sides are powers of \\( x \\), we equate the exponents: \\( 1 = 25/x \\), giving \\( x = 25 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 25 \\) back into \\( y = x^{10/x} \\): \\( y = 25^{10/25} = 25^{2/5} = 5^{4/5} \\).\n\nFinally, calculate \\( xy = 25 \\times 5^{4/5} \\).\n\nSince \\( 25 = 5^2 \\), we have \\( xy = 5^2 \\times 5^{4/5} = 5^{2 + 4/5} = 5^{14/5} \\).\n\nThis simplifies to \\( 5^{14/5} = (5^{1/5})^{14} = 5^2 = 25 \\).\n\nThus, \\( xy = 25 \\).\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
