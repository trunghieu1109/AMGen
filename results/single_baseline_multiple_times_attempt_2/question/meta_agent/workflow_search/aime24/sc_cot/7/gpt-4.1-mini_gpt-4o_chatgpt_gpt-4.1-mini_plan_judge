proposed answer: We start by analyzing the given logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \).

For the first equation, \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) means \( x^{10} = y^x \). Therefore, \( y = x^{10/x} \).

For the second equation, \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) means \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \). Therefore, \( x = y^{10/(4y)} \).

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into the second equation: \( x = (x^{10/x})^{10/(4x^{10/x})} \).

Simplifying gives \( x = x^{100/(4x)} \), which simplifies to \( x = x^{25/x} \).

Since both sides are powers of \( x \), we equate the exponents: \( 1 = 25/x \), giving \( x = 25 \).

Substitute \( x = 25 \) back into \( y = x^{10/x} \): \( y = 25^{10/25} = 25^{2/5} = 5^{4/5} \).

Finally, calculate \( xy = 25 \times 5^{4/5} \).

Since \( 25 = 5^2 \), we have \( xy = 5^2 \times 5^{4/5} = 5^{2 + 4/5} = 5^{14/5} \).

This simplifies to \( 5^{14/5} = (5^{1/5})^{14} = 5^2 = 25 \).

Thus, \( xy = 25 \).
