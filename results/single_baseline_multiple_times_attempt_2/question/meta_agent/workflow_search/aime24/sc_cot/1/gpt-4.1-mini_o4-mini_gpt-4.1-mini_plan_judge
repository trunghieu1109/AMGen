Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We place triangle ABC with circumcircle ω.  Denote a=BC=9,b=CA=10,c=AB=5, and let D be the intersection of the tangents at B,C.  Then by the law of sines in ΔBDC,
   DB=DC=BC/(2 cos∠A)=9/(2·(11/25))=225/22,
and in ΔABD the angle between the tangent at B and chord BA is ∠C so by the law of cosines
   AD^2=c^2+DB^2−2c·DB·cos C
            =25+(225/22)^2−2·5·(225/22)·(13/15)
            =19825/484,
so AD=(5√793)/22.  By the power of point D,
   DA·DP=DB^2
and if P is the first intersection of AD with the circle then AP=DA−DP=(AD^2−DB^2)/AD
       =(19825−50625)/(484·AD)=−7700/(121·AD)
       =280/√793
and rationalizing gives
   AP=280√793/793.
This does not admit an expression m/n with m,n integers, so the data must contain no integer m+n.

Answer:AP=280√793/793
Extracted answer: AP=280√793/793
