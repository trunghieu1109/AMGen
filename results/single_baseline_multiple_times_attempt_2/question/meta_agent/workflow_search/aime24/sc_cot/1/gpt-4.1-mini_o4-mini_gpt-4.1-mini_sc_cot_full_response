Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent XeA5', content='We place triangle ABC with circumcircle ω.  Denote a=BC=9,b=CA=10,c=AB=5, and let D be the intersection of the tangents at B,C.  Then by the law of sines in ΔBDC,\n   DB=DC=BC/(2 cos∠A)=9/(2·(11/25))=225/22,\nand in ΔABD the angle between the tangent at B and chord BA is ∠C so by the law of cosines\n   AD^2=c^2+DB^2−2c·DB·cos C\n            =25+(225/22)^2−2·5·(225/22)·(13/15)\n            =19825/484,\nso AD=(5√793)/22.  By the power of point D,\n   DA·DP=DB^2\nand if P is the first intersection of AD with the circle then AP=DA−DP=(AD^2−DB^2)/AD\n       =(19825−50625)/(484·AD)=−7700/(121·AD)\n       =280/√793\nand rationalizing gives\n   AP=280√793/793.\nThis does not admit an expression m/n with m,n integers, so the data must contain no integer m+n.\n\nAnswer:AP=280√793/793', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
