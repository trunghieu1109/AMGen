Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We are given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $\omega$, with tangents at $B$ and $C$ meeting at $D$. We need to find $AP$, where $P$ is the second intersection of $AD$ with the circle. Given are the side lengths $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$. Using the power of a point theorem for point $D$, which states that $DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP$, we can determine $AP$. The triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in $\omega$, so we can apply the formula for the circumradius $R = \frac{abc}{4K}$, where $K$ is the area of $\triangle ABC$. First, we calculate $K$ using Heron's formula. With $a = 5$, $b = 9$, $c = 10$, the semi-perimeter $s = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12$. The area $K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 12\sqrt{7}$. Now, $R = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 12\sqrt{7}} = \frac{15\sqrt{7}}{7}$. Applying the power of a point theorem, $AD \cdot DP = DB^2 = DC^2$. Since $DB = DC$, $D$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$, making $DB = DC$. The point $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the circles $\omega$ and the circle with diameter $BC$. The homothety centered at $D$ sends $A$ to $P$, with $AP = 2 \cdot AD$. Using the relation $AP = 2 \cdot AD$, we find $AP = 2 \times \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 12\sqrt{7}} = \frac{15}{2}$. Finally, $AP$ simplifies to $\frac{15}{2}$, so $m = 15$ and $n = 2$, giving $m+n = 17$.
