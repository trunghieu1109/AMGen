Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The game is a take-away game where each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. Alice moves first, and the player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. By analyzing the game states, we define positions as winning or losing for the player to move. The base case is f(0) = False (losing position). The recurrence is f(n) = True if either f(n-1) or f(n-4) is False, else False. Computing values for small n reveals a pattern: losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Since Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice (the first player), Bob can guarantee a win if n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Counting such n ≤ 2024: multiples of 5 (n mod 5 = 0) are 404 numbers, and numbers with n mod 5 = 2 are 405 numbers, totaling 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
