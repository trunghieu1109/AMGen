    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent tHrb:
The game is a variation of a take-away game where on each turn a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens from the stack. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves.

Step 1: Define winning and losing positions.
- A position is winning if the player about to move can force a win.
- A position is losing if the player about to move will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Step 2: Let W(n) = True if the position with n tokens is winning for the player to move, else False.

Step 3: Base cases:
- W(0) = False (no tokens to take, player to move loses)

Step 4: Recurrence:
- W(n) = True if either W(n-1) == False or W(n-4) == False (if these positions exist)
- Otherwise, W(n) = False

Step 5: Compute W(n) for n from 1 to 10 to find a pattern:

n=0: False
n=1: W(1) = not W(0) = True
n=2: W(2) = not W(1) or not W(-2) (invalid) =&gt; not True or invalid =&gt; False
n=3: W(3) = not W(2) or not W(-1) =&gt; not False or invalid =&gt; True
n=4: W(4) = not W(3) or not W(0) =&gt; not True or not False =&gt; False or True =&gt; True
n=5: W(5) = not W(4) or not W(1) =&gt; not True or not True =&gt; False or False =&gt; False
n=6: W(6) = not W(5) or not W(2) =&gt; not False or not False =&gt; True or True =&gt; True
n=7: W(7) = not W(6) or not W(3) =&gt; not True or not True =&gt; False or False =&gt; False
n=8: W(8) = not W(7) or not W(4) =&gt; not False or not True =&gt; True or False =&gt; True
n=9: W(9) = not W(8) or not W(5) =&gt; not True or not False =&gt; False or True =&gt; True
n=10: W(10) = not W(9) or not W(6) =&gt; not True or not True =&gt; False or False =&gt; False

Step 6: From the above, losing positions (W(n) = False) for the player to move are at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Step 7: Let&#39;s list losing positions for n ≤ 10:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Step 8: Check if pattern repeats. Let&#39;s continue a bit more:

n=11: W(11) = not W(10) or not W(7) =&gt; not False or not False =&gt; True or True =&gt; True
n=12: W(12) = not W(11) or not W(8) =&gt; not True or not True =&gt; False or False =&gt; False
n=13: W(13) = not W(12) or not W(9) =&gt; not False or not True =&gt; True or False =&gt; True
n=14: W(14) = not W(13) or not W(10) =&gt; not True or not False =&gt; False or True =&gt; True
n=15: W(15) = not W(14) or not W(11) =&gt; not True or not True =&gt; False or False =&gt; False

Step 9: Losing positions so far: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15

Step 10: Observe the losing positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15
Differences: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3
Pattern in losing positions seems to be alternating between adding 2 and 3.

Step 11: Let&#39;s verify the pattern explicitly:
Start from 0
Add 2 -&gt; 2
Add 3 -&gt; 5
Add 2 -&gt; 7
Add 3 -&gt; 10
Add 2 -&gt; 12
Add 3 -&gt; 15
Add 2 -&gt; 17
Add 3 -&gt; 20
Add 2 -&gt; 22
Add 3 -&gt; 25

Step 12: So losing positions are numbers of the form:
Losing positions = {0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, ...}

Step 13: Let&#39;s try to find a formula for losing positions.

Step 14: Define sequence l_k as losing positions:
l_0 = 0
l_1 = 2
l_2 = 5
l_3 = 7
l_4 = 10
l_5 = 12
l_6 = 15
l_7 = 17
l_8 = 20
l_9 = 22
l_10 = 25

Step 15: Notice that l_k for even k (k=0,2,4,6,8,10) are:
0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
which is 5 * (k/2)

For odd k (k=1,3,5,7,9):
2, 7, 12, 17, 22
which is 5 * ((k-1)/2) + 2

Step 16: So losing positions can be described as:
For even k: l_k = 5 * (k/2)
For odd k: l_k = 5 * ((k-1)/2) + 2

Step 17: Alternatively, losing positions modulo 5 are either 0 or 2:
Check l_k mod 5:
0 mod 5 = 0
2 mod 5 = 2
5 mod 5 = 0
7 mod 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0
12 mod 5 = 2
15 mod 5 = 0
17 mod 5 = 2
20 mod 5 = 0
22 mod 5 = 2
25 mod 5 = 0

So losing positions are all n such that n mod 5 == 0 or n mod 5 == 2.

Step 18: Since Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice (the first player), Bob can guarantee a win if n is losing for the first player to move.

Step 19: We want the count of positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 == 0 or n mod 5 == 2.

Step 20: Count numbers ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 == 0:
Multiples of 5 ≤ 2024 are floor(2024/5) = 404

Step 21: Count numbers ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 == 2:
Numbers of the form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
Max k satisfies 5k + 2 ≤ 2024 =&gt; 5k ≤ 2022 =&gt; k ≤ 404
So k = 0 to 404 =&gt; 405 numbers

Step 22: Total numbers = 404 + 405 = 809

Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.


### thinking by Debate Agent NYM2:
We have a game where Alice and Bob alternately remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. We want to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

This is a classic impartial combinational game. We can analyze it using the concept of &#34;winning&#34; and &#34;losing&#34; positions. A position is &#34;losing&#34; if the player to move cannot force a win, and &#34;winning&#34; if the player to move can force a win.

Key points:
- Alice moves first.
- If the starting position is losing for the first player, then the second player (Bob) can guarantee a win.

Step 1: Define the game states:
- Let f(n) = True if the position with n tokens is winning for the player to move.
- f(n) = False if the position with n tokens is losing for the player to move.

Step 2: Base case:
- f(0) = False because if there are no tokens, the player to move cannot move and loses.

Step 3: Recurrence:
- f(n) = True if at least one of f(n-1) or f(n-4) is False (i.e., the player can move to a losing position for the opponent).
- f(n) = False if both f(n-1) and f(n-4) are True.

Step 4: Compute f(n) for n = 0 to 10 to find a pattern:
- f(0) = False
- f(1) = not f(0) or not f(-3) (ignore negative) =&gt; not False = True
- f(2) = not f(1) or not f(-2) =&gt; not True = False
- f(3) = not f(2) or not f(-1) =&gt; not False = True
- f(4) = not f(3) or not f(0) = not True or not False = False or True = True
- f(5) = not f(4) or not f(1) = not True or not True = False or False = False
- f(6) = not f(5) or not f(2) = not False or not False = True or True = True
- f(7) = not f(6) or not f(3) = not True or not True = False or False = False
- f(8) = not f(7) or not f(4) = not False or not True = True or False = True
- f(9) = not f(8) or not f(5) = not True or not False = False or True = True
- f(10) = not f(9) or not f(6) = not True or not True = False or False = False

Summary:
- n: 0  1   2    3   4    5    6    7    8    9   10
- f: F  T   F    T   T    F    T    F    T    T    F

Step 5: Identify losing positions (f(n) = False): n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10...

Step 6: Check the pattern of losing positions:
- Losing positions so far: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10
- Differences: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3

Try to find a pattern modulo something. Let&#39;s check modulo 5:
- 0 mod 5 = 0 (losing)
- 2 mod 5 = 2 (losing)
- 5 mod 5 = 0 (losing)
- 7 mod 5 = 2 (losing)
- 10 mod 5 = 0 (losing)

So losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Step 7: Confirm this pattern for more values:
- f(12) check:
  f(12) = not f(11) or not f(8)
  We need f(11) and f(8):
  f(8) = True (from above)
  f(11) = not f(10) or not f(7) = not False or not False = True or True = True
  So f(12) = not True or not True = False
  12 mod 5 = 2, matches the pattern.

Step 8: Conclusion:
- Losing positions for the player to move are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Step 9: Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the starting position is losing for Alice, i.e., f(n) = False.
- So Bob wins if n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Step 10: Count how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 0 or 2.
- Numbers with n mod 5 = 0: multiples of 5 up to 2024
  Count = floor(2024 / 5) = 404
- Numbers with n mod 5 = 2:
  The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., up to ≤ 2024
  Number of terms = floor((2024 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2022/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405

Total = 404 + 405 = 809

    <pre>The game is a take-away game where each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. Alice moves first, and the player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. By analyzing the game states, we define positions as winning or losing for the player to move. The base case is f(0) = False (losing position). The recurrence is f(n) = True if either f(n-1) or f(n-4) is False, else False. Computing values for small n reveals a pattern: losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Since Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice (the first player), Bob can guarantee a win if n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Counting such n ≤ 2024: multiples of 5 (n mod 5 = 0) are 404 numbers, and numbers with n mod 5 = 2 are 405 numbers, totaling 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
