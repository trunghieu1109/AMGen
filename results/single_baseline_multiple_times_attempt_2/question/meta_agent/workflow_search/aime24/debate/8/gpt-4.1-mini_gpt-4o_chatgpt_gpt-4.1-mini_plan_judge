Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice. A position is losing for Alice if every move she makes leaves Bob in a winning position. We start by identifying small cases: 1 token is losing for Alice because she can only take 1 token and leave 0 for Bob, who wins. 2, 3, and 4 tokens are winning for Alice because she can leave Bob with 1 token, a losing position. 5 tokens is a losing position because any move leaves Bob with 2 or 4 tokens, both of which are winning. By continuing this process, we see that a pattern emerges: n is losing for Alice if n is of the form 1, 5, 9, 13, ..., that is, n = 4k + 1 for some non-negative integer k. Therefore, Bob will win if n = 4k + 1. To find how many such n are less than or equal to 2024, we solve 4k + 1 <= 2024, which gives k <= 505. Thus, there are 506 such values of n.
