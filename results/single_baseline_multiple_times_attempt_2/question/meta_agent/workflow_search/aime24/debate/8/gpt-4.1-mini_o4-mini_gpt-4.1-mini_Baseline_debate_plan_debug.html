    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent dGEq:
We have a subtraction game where each move removes 1 or 4 tokens. 0 is a P-position.  A position is N if it has a move to a P-position, and P if all moves go to N-positions.  Computing small values shows P-positions at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,… with differences cycling 2,3.  Thus P-positions are exactly those n with n mod 5∈{0,2}.  For n from 1 to 2024, the number of n≡0 mod5 is ⌊2024/5⌋=404, and the number of n≡2 mod5 is also 405, giving total 404+405=809.  Hence Bob wins if and only if n≡0 or 2 mod5, and there are 809 such n≤2024.

### thinking by Debate Agent Th9D:
We have an impartial game where players remove 1 or 4 tokens, and the player taking the last token wins. Positions where the next player to move loses (P-positions) satisfy that no move leads to another P-position. Computing Grundy values for small n shows P-positions occur exactly when n mod 5 ∈ {0,2}. Thus Bob, as the second player, can force a win exactly for those starting n. We need to count positive n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 or 2. 

Count for n mod 5 = 0: floor(2024/5) = 404.
Count for n mod 5 = 2: floor((2024−2)/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405.
Total = 404 + 405 = 809.

    <pre>We model the game as a subtraction game where players can remove 1 or 4 tokens. P-positions (where the previous player wins) satisfy that no move leads to another P-position. Computing small values shows P-positions at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,… and in general n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Bob, as the second player, has a winning strategy exactly when the starting n is a P-position (n≡0 or 2 mod 5). For n≤2024: the count of n≡0 mod 5 is ⌊2024/5⌋=404; the count of n≡2 mod 5 is also 405 (from 2 up to 2022). Total = 404+405 = 809.
