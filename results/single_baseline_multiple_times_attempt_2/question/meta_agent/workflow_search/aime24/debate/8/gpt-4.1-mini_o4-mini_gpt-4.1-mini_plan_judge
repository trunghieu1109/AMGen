Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We model the game as a subtraction game where players can remove 1 or 4 tokens. P-positions (where the previous player wins) satisfy that no move leads to another P-position. Computing small values shows P-positions at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,… and in general n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Bob, as the second player, has a winning strategy exactly when the starting n is a P-position (n≡0 or 2 mod 5). For n≤2024: the count of n≡0 mod 5 is ⌊2024/5⌋=404; the count of n≡2 mod 5 is also 405 (from 2 up to 2022). Total = 404+405 = 809.
