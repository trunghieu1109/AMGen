    <pre>Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

### thinking by Debate Agent Tx7o:
We place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). The line DC is y=16. Rectangle EFGH has EF of length 184 on that line: let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16), and FG vertical of length 17 upward (so G=(x+184,33), H=(x,33)). The circle through A and D has center on the perpendicular bisector of AD, i.e. y=8. Enforcing that H and G also lie on this circle gives a quadratic in x: x^2+184x–561=0, whose solutions are x=3 or x=–187. Taking x=3 places E between D and C, so CE=|107–3|=104.

### thinking by Debate Agent zyeZ:
We place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear, E and F lie on the line y=16. Rectangle EFGH has EF=184 horizontal and FG=17 vertical.  To have A,D,H,G concyclic, the circle through A and D has center on the perpendicular bisector of AD (y=8).  Call E=(x_E,16), F=(x_F,16), G=(x_F,33), H=(x_E,33).  From EF=184 we get x_F=x_E+184.  Equating the power of H and G to that circle gives x_E·x_F=561.  Thus x_E(x_E+184)=561 → x_E^2+184x_E−561=0 → (x_E+187)(x_E−3)=0.  The positive solution is x_E=3.  Hence C=(107,16) and E=(3,16) so CE=|107−3|=104.
