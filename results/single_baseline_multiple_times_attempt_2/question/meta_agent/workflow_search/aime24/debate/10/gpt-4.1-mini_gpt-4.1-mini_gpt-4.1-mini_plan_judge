Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: Two rectangles ABCD and EFGH are given with AB=107, BC=16, EF=184, FG=17. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Placing ABCD with A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16), the line through D and C is y=16. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F lie on y=16. Let E = (x,16), F = (x+184,16). Then G = (x+184,-1), H = (x,-1). Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(x+184,-1) are concyclic. Using the circle conditions, solving for x yields x = -77. Therefore, E = (-77,16), C = (107,16), so CE = |107 - (-77)| = 184.
