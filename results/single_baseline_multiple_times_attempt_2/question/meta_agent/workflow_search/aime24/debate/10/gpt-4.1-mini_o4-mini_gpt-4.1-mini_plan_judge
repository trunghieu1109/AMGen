Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16, let E=(x,16) and F=(x+184,16). Rectangle EFGH has FG=17 so G=(x+184,33) and H=(x,33). The circle through A and D has center on the perpendicular bisector of AD (y=8). Requiring H and G lie on that circle leads to x(x+184)=561, i.e. x^2+184x−561=0. The positive solution is x=3. Thus E=(3,16) and C=(107,16), giving CE=107−3=104.
