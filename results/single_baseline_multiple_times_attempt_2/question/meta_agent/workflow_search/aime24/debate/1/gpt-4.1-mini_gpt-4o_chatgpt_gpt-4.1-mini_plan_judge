Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of tangents and the symmedian in a triangle. Since D is the intersection of the tangents to the circle at B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the adjacent sides. Therefore, BP:PC = AB^2:AC^2 = 25:100 = 1:4. This means P divides BC in the ratio 1:4. Let BP = x and PC = 4x, then BC = 5x = 9, so x = 1.8. Thus, BP = 1.8 and PC = 7.2. The length of AP can be found using the symmedian length formula, but a simpler approach is to use the fact that AD is the symmedian and apply the ratio directly. Since AP divides the chord BC in the ratio 1:4, and the total length BC is 9, we can find AP using the formula for the symmedian length: AP = (AB * AC) / (AB + AC) * (BP / BC) = (5 * 10) / (5 + 10) * (1.8 / 9) = 50 / 15 * 0.2 = 10/3. Therefore, AP = 10/3, and m = 10, n = 3, so m + n = 13.
