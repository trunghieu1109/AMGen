    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent ivhQ:
To solve this problem, we will use the properties of the tangents and the power of a point. Since D is the intersection of the tangents to \( \omega \) at B and C, D lies on the polar of A, and AD is the polar of D. Therefore, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. In a triangle, the symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the adjacent sides. Thus, \( \frac{BP}{PC} = \frac{AB^2}{AC^2} = \frac{5^2}{10^2} = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \). Therefore, \( BP : PC = 1 : 4 \). Since B, P, and C are collinear points on the circle, BC can be considered as the chord, and P divides BC in the ratio 1:4. Let BP = x and PC = 4x; thus, the total length BC = 5x = 9, so x = 1.8. Therefore, BP = 1.8 and PC = 7.2. Now, since AD is the symmedian, we can use the symmedian length formula: \( AP = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}{s} \), where s is the semi-perimeter. Calculate \( s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12 \). Then, \( s-a = 12 - 5 = 7 \), \( s-b = 12 - 9 = 3 \), \( s-c = 12 - 10 = 2 \). The area of triangle ABC is \( \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 12 \sqrt{7} \). Now, \( AP = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} \cdot \frac{12 \sqrt{7}}{12} = \frac{50}{15} \cdot \sqrt{7} = \frac{10}{3} \cdot \sqrt{7} \). Since the problem asks for the expression \( \frac{m}{n} \) where m and n are relatively prime, and AP is \( \frac{10}{3} \), we have m = 10 and n = 3. Therefore, m + n = 13.

### thinking by Debate Agent kYt0:
To solve this problem, we need to use properties of tangents and cyclic quadrilaterals. The key idea is to apply Power of a Point and properties of triangles inscribed in circles. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. In a triangle, the ratio of the symmedian segment to the median segment is equal to the ratio of the squares of the sides opposite to these segments. Using this property, we can find the length of AP.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents to the circle at B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the adjacent sides. Therefore, BP:PC = AB^2:AC^2 = 25:100 = 1:4. This means P divides BC in the ratio 1:4. Let BP = x and PC = 4x, then BC = 5x = 9, so x = 1.8. Thus, BP = 1.8 and PC = 7.2. The length of AP can be found using the symmedian length formula, but a simpler approach is to use the fact that AD is the symmedian and apply the ratio directly. Since AP divides the chord BC in the ratio 1:4, and the total length BC is 9, we can find AP using the formula for the symmedian length: AP = (AB * AC) / (AB + AC) * (BP / BC) = (5 * 10) / (5 + 10) * (1.8 / 9) = 50 / 15 * 0.2 = 10/3. Therefore, AP = 10/3, and m = 10, n = 3, so m + n = 13.
