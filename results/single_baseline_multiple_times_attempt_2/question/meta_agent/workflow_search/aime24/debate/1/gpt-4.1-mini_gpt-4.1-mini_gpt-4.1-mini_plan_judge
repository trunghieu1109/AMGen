Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We are given triangle ABC inscribed in circle ω with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Tangents at B and C intersect at D, and line AD meets ω again at P. We want length AP in simplest fraction form and then sum numerator and denominator.

Using coordinate geometry, place B=(0,0), C=(9,0). Then A=(1/3, 4√14/3) from distance conditions.

Find circle center O by perpendicular bisectors: O=(4.5, 33/(4√14)) with radius R=75√14/56.

Tangents at B and C have slopes -6√14/11 and 6√14/11 respectively, intersecting at D=(4.5, -27√14/11).

Vector AD components: (25/6, -125√14/33). Length AD = sqrt((25/6)^2 + (-125√14/33)^2) = 2925/198.

Power of point D: DB^2 = DA * DP, with DB^2 = 50625/484, DA^2 = 8555625/39204.

Using AP + PD = AD and DP = AD - AP, power of point gives DB^2 = AD * (AD - AP) => AP = (AD^2 - DB^2)/AD.

Calculate AP = (8555625/39204 - 50625/484) / (2925/198) = (4455000/39204) * (198/2925) = 882990000 / 114689700 = 77/10.

Therefore, AP = 77/10, and sum m + n = 77 + 10 = 87.
