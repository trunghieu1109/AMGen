Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent AwJT', content='We apply the tangent–secant power of point D: since DB and DC are tangents, DB^2 = DA·DP. But DP = DA + AP, so DA·(DA + AP) = DB^2 ⇒ AP = (DB^2 − DA^2)/DA. Computing side lengths gives DB = 225/22 and DA = 325/22. Substituting yields AP = ( (225/22)^2 − (325/22)^2 ) / (325/22) = 100/13. Thus m + n = 100 + 13 = 113.\n\nAnswer:113', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The tangent at B has equation (X−5)(5/2)+(Y−0)(−65/(4√14))=0, and the tangent at C has equation (X−22/5)(19/10)+(Y−12√14/5)(347/(20√14))=0.  Their intersection is D=(305/22, 15√14/11).  Parametrize line AD: (x,y)=t·D.  Substituting into the circle equation yields t=0 (A) and t=968/1859 (P).  Thus AP=t·AD=(968/1859)·(325/22)=1100/143=100/13, so m+n=100+13=113.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent iYkI:\nWe place triangle ABC with B=(0,0), C=(9,0), and find A=(1/3,4√14/3). The circumcircle center O is computed via perpendicular bisectors, and the tangents at B and C meet at D. A direct use of the tangent–secant power of a point at D gives DB^2 = DA·DP, but DP = DA + AP, so DA·(DA+AP)=DB^2, hence AP = (DB^2−DA^2)/DA. Computing DA=325/22 and DB=225/22 yields AP =100/13, so m+n=113.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent hGLO:\n113\n\n### answer by Debate Agent iYkI:\n113\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
