    <pre>Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### thinking by Debate Agent gTas:
We are given the equation a + b + c = 300 where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and the condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, rewrite the second expression:

Sum = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b
= a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b)
Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So,
Sum = a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c)
= 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)

We want this to equal 6,000,000.

Now, note that the sum a + b + c = 300.
We can use the identity for cubes:
(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc
But this looks complicated; let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a better way.

Alternatively, consider the symmetric sums:
Let S1 = a + b + c = 300
S2 = ab + bc + ca
S3 = abc
We want to express a^2 + b^2 + c^2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Recall:
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2
and
(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3

So,
Sum = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)
= 300(S1^2 - 2S2) - [S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3]
= 300 * 300^2 - 600 S2 - (300^3 - 90000 S2 + 3 S3)
= 300 * 90000 - 600 S2 - 27,000,000 + 90,000 S2 - 3 S3
= 27,000,000 - 600 S2 - 27,000,000 + 90,000 S2 - 3 S3
= ( -600 S2 + 90,000 S2 ) - 3 S3
= 89,400 S2 - 3 S3

Given Sum = 6,000,000, we have
6,000,000 = 89,400 S2 - 3 S3
or
89,400 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000

Rearranged:
3 S3 = 89,400 S2 - 6,000,000
S3 = (89,400 S2 - 6,000,000)/3

Since a,b,c are nonnegative integers, S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc must be integers.

We want to find all triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300, a,b,c ≥ 0, such that 89,400 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Now, consider the possible values of S2 and S3.

Note that S2 and S3 depend on the triple (a,b,c).

Try to find integer solutions (a,b,c) that satisfy this equation.

Because the problem is symmetric in a,b,c, we can assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b ≤ c.

Try some special cases:

1) If one of the variables is zero, say c=0, then a + b = 300.
Then S2 = ab + b*0 + a*0 = ab
S3 = abc = 0
So the equation reduces to 89,400 * ab - 0 = 6,000,000
So ab = 6,000,000 / 89,400 ≈ 67.1 (not an integer)

No integer solution here.

2) Try a=b=c=100
Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000=30,000
S3 = 100*100*100=1,000,000
Check 89,400 * 30,000 - 3 * 1,000,000 = 2,682,000,000 - 3,000,000 = 2,679,000,000 which is way bigger than 6,000,000.

3) Try a=0, b=150, c=150
Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = 0 + 150*150 + 0 = 22,500
S3=0
Check 89,400 * 22,500 = 2,011,500,000 &gt;&gt; 6,000,000

4) Try a=1, b=1, c=298
Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = 1*1 + 1*298 + 1*298 = 1 + 298 + 298 = 597
S3 = 1*1*298=298
Check 89,400 * 597 - 3*298 = 53,431,800 - 894 = 53,430,906 &gt;&gt; 6,000,000

5) Try to find S2 such that 89,400 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000
Since S3 ≥ 0, 89,400 S2 ≥ 6,000,000
So minimum S2 is ceil(6,000,000 / 89,400) = 67
Try S2=67
Then 3 S3 = 89,400 * 67 - 6,000,000 = 5,989,800 - 6,000,000 = -10,200 (negative, impossible)

Try S2=68
3 S3 = 89,400*68 - 6,000,000 = 6,079,200 - 6,000,000 = 79,200
S3 = 26,400

Now, can we find (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300, S2=68, and S3=26,400?

Note that S2 = ab + bc + ca = 68 is quite small, but S3 = abc = 26,400 is large.

Try to find integer triples with sum 300, product 26,400, and sum of pairwise products 68.

Since 68 is very small and 26,400 is large, this is unlikely.

Try S2=67, S3 negative impossible, try S2=69
3 S3=89,400*69 - 6,000,000=6,168,600 - 6,000,000=168,600
S3=56,200

Try S2=70
3 S3=89,400*70 - 6,000,000=6,258,000 - 6,000,000=258,000
S3=86,000

Try S2=71
3 S3=89,400*71 - 6,000,000=6,347,400 - 6,000,000=347,400
S3=115,800

Try S2=72
3 S3=89,400*72 - 6,000,000=6,436,800 - 6,000,000=436,800
S3=145,600

Try S2=73
3 S3=89,400*73 - 6,000,000=6,526,200 - 6,000,000=526,200
S3=175,400

Try S2=74
3 S3=89,400*74 - 6,000,000=6,615,600 - 6,000,000=615,600
S3=205,200

Try S2=75
3 S3=89,400*75 - 6,000,000=6,705,000 - 6,000,000=705,000
S3=235,000

Try to find integer triples with sum 300, sum of products S2 around 70, and product S3 around 200,000.

Try to find triples with such parameters is complicated.

Alternatively, try to find all triples (a,b,c) such that the expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

Notice that the expression is symmetric and can be rewritten as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Check:
(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b

Verify for variables:
(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b

So the expression equals (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

Given a + b + c = 300,
We have 300 * S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000

So 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000
or
100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000

So S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000

Now, since a,b,c are nonnegative integers, S3 = abc ≥ 0
So 100 S2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0
=&gt; S2 ≥ 20,000

But S2 = ab + bc + ca ≤ (a + b + c)^2 / 3 = 300^2 / 3 = 90,000 / 3 = 30,000 (by QM-AM inequality)

So S2 is between 20,000 and 30,000

Try to find integer triples (a,b,c) with sum 300, sum of products S2 between 20,000 and 30,000, and product S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Try to find such triples by trial:
Try a=b=c=100
S2=100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100=30,000
S3=1,000,000
Check S3=100 S2 - 2,000,000=100*30,000 - 2,000,000=3,000,000 - 2,000,000=1,000,000
Matches!

So (100,100,100) is a solution.

Try a=99, b=100, c=101
Sum=300
S2=99*100 + 100*101 + 99*101=9,900 + 10,100 + 9,999=29,999
S3=99*100*101=999,900
Check S3=100 S2 - 2,000,000=100*29,999 - 2,000,000=2,999,900 - 2,000,000=999,900
No match, off by 0. So not exact.

Try a=98, b=101, c=101
Sum=300
S2=98*101 + 101*101 + 98*101=9,898 + 10,201 + 9,898=29,997
S3=98*101*101=1,000,298
Check 100*29,997 - 2,000,000=2,999,700 - 2,000,000=999,700
No match.

Try a=101, b=101, c=98
Same as above.

Try a=100, b=99, c=101
S2=100*99 + 99*101 + 100*101=9,900 + 9,999 + 10,100=29,999
S3=100*99*101=999,900
Check 100*29,999 - 2,000,000=999,900
Matches S3.

So (100,99,101), (99,100,101), (100,101,99), (101,100,99), (101,99,100), (99,101,100) are solutions.

Similarly, check a=100, b=100, c=100 is a solution.

Try a=100, b=100, c=100
S2=30,000
S3=1,000,000
Check 100*30,000 - 2,000,000=1,000,000
Matches.

Try a=101, b=101, c=98
S2=29,997
S3=1,000,298
Check 100*29,997 - 2,000,000=999,700
No match.

Try a=102, b=99, c=99
S2=102*99 + 99*99 + 102*99=10,098 + 9,801 + 10,098=30,000
S3=102*99*99=1,000,098
Check 100*30,000 - 2,000,000=1,000,000
No match.

So only a few triples close to (100,100,100) satisfy the equation exactly.

Now, the equation is symmetric, so all permutations of (100,100,100) and (100,99,101) and permutations of (99,100,101) are solutions.

Check if (101, 99, 100) is solution:
S2=101*99 + 99*100 + 101*100=9,999 + 9,900 + 10,100=29,999
S3=101*99*100=999,900
Check 100*29,999 - 2,000,000=999,900
Matches.

So all permutations of (100,99,101) are solutions.

Number of distinct permutations:
- For (100,100,100), only 1 permutation.
- For (100,99,101), all distinct, so 3! = 6 permutations.

Total solutions = 1 + 6 = 7.

Check if any other triples satisfy the equation.

Try (100,98,102):
S2=100*98 + 98*102 + 100*102=9,800 + 9,996 + 10,200=29,996
S3=100*98*102=999,600
Check 100*29,996 - 2,000,000=999,600
Matches.

So (100,98,102) and permutations are solutions, 6 permutations.

Similarly, (100,97,103):
S2=100*97 + 97*103 + 100*103=9,700 + 9,991 + 10,300=29,991
S3=100*97*103=999,100
Check 100*29,991 - 2,000,000=999,100
Matches.

6 permutations.

Notice a pattern:
Try to find all triples with sum 300, such that S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Rewrite:
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

Try to find all integer triples (a,b,c) with sum 300, and satisfying this.

Try to parametrize the solutions.

Try a = x, b = y, c = 300 - x - y
Then
S2 = xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y) = xy + 300y - xy - y^2 + 300x - x^2 - xy = 300x + 300y - x^2 - y^2 - xy

S3 = x y (300 - x - y) = 300 x y - x^2 y - x y^2

Equation:
abc = 100 S2 - 2,000,000
=&gt; 300 x y - x^2 y - x y^2 = 100 (300x + 300y - x^2 - y^2 - xy) - 2,000,000

Rewrite:
300 x y - x^2 y - x y^2 = 30,000 x + 30,000 y - 100 x^2 - 100 y^2 - 100 x y - 2,000,000

Bring all terms to one side:
300 x y - x^2 y - x y^2 - 30,000 x - 30,000 y + 100 x^2 + 100 y^2 + 100 x y + 2,000,000 = 0

Try to find integer solutions (x,y) with x,y ≥ 0, x + y ≤ 300.

Try to test integer values of x around 100 and find y.

Try x=100:
300*100*y - 100^2 * y - 100 * y^2 - 30,000*100 - 30,000 y + 100*100^2 + 100 y^2 + 100*100*y + 2,000,000 = 0

Calculate terms:
30000 y - 10000 y - 100 y^2 - 3,000,000 - 30,000 y + 1,000,000 + 100 y^2 + 10,000 y + 2,000,000 = 0

Simplify:
(30000 y - 10000 y - 30000 y + 10000 y) + (-100 y^2 + 100 y^2) + (-3,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000) = 0

The y terms cancel out:
(30000 - 10000 - 30000 + 10000) y = (30000 - 30000 + 0) y = 0

The y^2 terms cancel out.

Constant terms: -3,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 0

So the equation reduces to 0 = 0 for x=100 and any y.

So for x=100, the equation is always satisfied for any y.

But remember the domain constraints: y ≥ 0, x + y ≤ 300 =&gt; y ≤ 200

Then c = 300 - x - y = 300 - 100 - y = 200 - y ≥ 0

So y can be from 0 to 200.

So for x=100, y=0..200, c=200 - y

Check if abc = 100 S2 - 2,000,000 holds for these.

Try y=0:
Then (a,b,c) = (100,0,200)
S2 = ab + bc + ca = 100*0 + 0*200 + 100*200 = 20,000
abc = 100*0*200=0
Check 100 S2 - 2,000,000 = 100*20,000 - 2,000,000=2,000,000 - 2,000,000=0
Matches abc=0

Try y=50:
(a,b,c) = (100,50,150)
S2 = 100*50 + 50*150 + 100*150 = 5,000 + 7,500 + 15,000=27,500
abc=100*50*150=750,000
Check 100*27,500 - 2,000,000=2,750,000 - 2,000,000=750,000
Matches

Try y=100:
(a,b,c) = (100,100,100)
S2=30,000
abc=1,000,000
Check 100*30,000 - 2,000,000=3,000,000 - 2,000,000=1,000,000
Matches

Try y=200:
(a,b,c)=(100,200,0)
S2=100*200 + 200*0 + 100*0=20,000
abc=100*200*0=0
Check 100*20,000 - 2,000,000=0
Matches

So for x=100, any y in [0,200] integer, (100,y,200 - y) is a solution.

Similarly, try x=0:
Equation reduces to:
300*0*y - 0 - 0 - 30,000*0 - 30,000 y + 0 + 100 y^2 + 0 + 2,000,000 = 0
Simplify:
-30,000 y + 100 y^2 + 2,000,000 = 0

Rearranged:
100 y^2 - 30,000 y + 2,000,000 = 0
Divide by 100:
y^2 - 300 y + 20,000 = 0

Discriminant:
D = 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000

Square root: 100

Roots:
y = (300 ± 100)/2
= (400)/2=200 or (200)/2=100

So y=100 or 200

Check y=100:
(a,b,c) = (0,100,200)
Sum=300
S2=0*100 + 100*200 + 0*200=20,000
abc=0
Check 100*20,000 - 2,000,000=0
Matches

Similarly y=200:
(0,200,100)
S2=0*200 + 200*100 + 0*100=20,000
abc=0
Matches

So (0,100,200) and (0,200,100) are solutions.

Similarly, for y=100, try to find x:
Try y=100:
Equation becomes:
300 x * 100 - x^2 * 100 - x * 100^2 - 30,000 x - 3,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 100 x^2 + 1,000,000 + 10,000 x + 2,000,000=0
Simplify and check, but the main conclusion is the equation is linear in x and y.

From the above, for x=100, all y in 0..200 are solutions.

Similarly, by symmetry, for y=100, all x in 0..200 are solutions.

And for c=100, all x,y with x + y ≤ 200 are solutions.

So the solutions are all triples (a,b,c) with sum 300 where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

So the solutions are all triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300, and exactly one of a,b,c equals 100.

Number of such triples:
For each choice of which variable is 100 (3 choices), the other two variables are nonnegative integers summing to 200.
Number of nonnegative integer solutions to x + y = 200 is 201.

So total number of solutions = 3 * 201 = 603.

Additionally, check if the triple (100,100,100) (all three equal 100) is included:
Yes, it has three variables equal to 100, so it is counted 3 times in the above count? No, because above we counted only triples with exactly one variable equal to 100.

So add (100,100,100) separately.

Thus total solutions = 603 + 1 = 604.

Final answer: 604 triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers with a + b + c = 300 satisfy the given equation.

### thinking by Debate Agent YuG5:
We are given nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, notice that the expression can be rewritten as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Therefore, the expression becomes a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c). This equals 6,000,000. Expanding, we get 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. Using the identity for sum of cubes and sum of squares, and the fact that a + b + c = 300, we can analyze the equation further. We also note that a, b, c are integers between 0 and 300. We try to find all triples (a,b,c) that satisfy this equation. To simplify, we can consider the symmetric nature and try to find solutions where two variables are equal or where one is zero. After systematic checking and algebraic manipulation, the only triples that satisfy the equation are permutations of (100, 100, 100). Since a + b + c = 300 and each is 100, the sum condition is satisfied. Checking the expression: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 3 * (100^2 * 100 + 100^2 * 100) = 3 * (10,000 * 100 + 10,000 * 100) = 3 * (1,000,000 + 1,000,000) = 3 * 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. So the triple (100, 100, 100) works. Since the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers, and (100, 100, 100) is the only one, the answer is 1.

    <pre>The problem asks for the number of nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 satisfying a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The expression can be rewritten as (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Since a+b+c=300, this becomes 300*S2 - 3*S3 = 6,000,000, where S2=ab+bc+ca and S3=abc. Rearranged, 100*S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. Because a,b,c are nonnegative integers, S3=abc≥0, so 100*S2 ≥ 2,000,000, implying S2 ≥ 20,000. Also, S2 ≤ 30,000 by inequality. Testing the triple (100,100,100) gives S2=30,000 and S3=1,000,000, satisfying the equation exactly. Further analysis shows that for any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the equation holds. For example, (100,y,200-y) for y=0..200 satisfies the equation. By symmetry, the same applies if b=100 or c=100. The number of such triples is 3 * 201 = 603. The triple (100,100,100) is included in these counts only once, so total solutions are 603 + 1 = 604. Therefore, the total number of triples is 604.
