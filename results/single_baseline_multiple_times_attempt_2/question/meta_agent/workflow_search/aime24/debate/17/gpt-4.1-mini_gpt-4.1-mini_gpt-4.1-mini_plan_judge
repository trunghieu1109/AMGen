Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 satisfying a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The expression can be rewritten as (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Since a+b+c=300, this becomes 300*S2 - 3*S3 = 6,000,000, where S2=ab+bc+ca and S3=abc. Rearranged, 100*S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. Because a,b,c are nonnegative integers, S3=abc≥0, so 100*S2 ≥ 2,000,000, implying S2 ≥ 20,000. Also, S2 ≤ 30,000 by inequality. Testing the triple (100,100,100) gives S2=30,000 and S3=1,000,000, satisfying the equation exactly. Further analysis shows that for any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the equation holds. For example, (100,y,200-y) for y=0..200 satisfies the equation. By symmetry, the same applies if b=100 or c=100. The number of such triples is 3 * 201 = 603. The triple (100,100,100) is included in these counts only once, so total solutions are 603 + 1 = 604. Therefore, the total number of triples is 604.
