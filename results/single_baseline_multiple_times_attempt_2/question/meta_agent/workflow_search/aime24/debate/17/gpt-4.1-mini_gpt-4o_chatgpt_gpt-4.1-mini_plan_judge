Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Both agents have analyzed the problem and concluded that the system of equations a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 can be simplified by considering the symmetry and possible values of a, b, and c. By substituting a = b = c = 100, we find that this satisfies both equations, as 3(100^2)(200) = 6,000,000. Given the symmetry and the nature of the polynomial equation, it is unlikely that other solutions exist, as small perturbations around this symmetric solution do not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, the only solution is (100, 100, 100), and the number of such triples is 1.
