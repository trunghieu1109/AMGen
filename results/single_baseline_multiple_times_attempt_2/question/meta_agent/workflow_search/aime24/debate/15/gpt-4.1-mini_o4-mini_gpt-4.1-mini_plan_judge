Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let A, B, C, D be the sets of owners of diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts with sizes 195, 367, 562, and 900 respectively. Every resident owns hearts, so D=900 and the total population is 900. Let Ni be the number of residents owning exactly i items. Given N2=437, N3=234, N4=x. Then N1=900−(437+234+x)=229−x. The total number of item‐ownerships is |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=2024, which also equals N1+2N2+3N3+4N4=(229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=1805+3x. Setting 1805+3x=2024 gives x=73.
