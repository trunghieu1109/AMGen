In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent qiEX', content='Let A, B, C, D be the sets of owners of diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts with sizes 195, 367, 562, and 900 respectively. Every resident owns hearts, so D=900 and the total population is 900. Let Ni be the number of residents owning exactly i items. Given N2=437, N3=234, N4=x. Then N1=900−(437+234+x)=229−x. The total number of item‐ownerships is |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=2024, which also equals N1+2N2+3N3+4N4=(229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=1805+3x. Setting 1805+3x=2024 gives x=73.\n\nAnswer:73', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

We have |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562, |D|=900, total residents N=900. Let N_i be the number of residents owning exactly i items. We know N_2=437, N_3=234, N_4=x, and N_1=900−(437+234+x)=229−x. The sum of items owned is S=|A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=2024, which also equals N_1+2N_2+3N_3+4N_4=(229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=1805+3x. Setting 1805+3x=2024 gives x=73.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ecWv:\nLet A, B, C, D be the sets of owners of ring (195), golf clubs (367), spade (562), and candy hearts (900). Every resident owns hearts, so D=900 and universe=900. Let Ni be the number owning exactly i items. Given N2=437, N3=234, N4=x. Then N1 = 900−(437+234+x)=229−x. The sum of set sizes equals the sum over residents of how many sets they own: 195+367+562+900=2024. Also this equals 1·N1+2·N2+3·N3+4·N4 = (229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x. Compute: 229−x+874+702+4x = 1805+3x. Set 1805+3x=2024 ⇒3x=219 ⇒x=73.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Quci:\n73\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ecWv:\n73\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
