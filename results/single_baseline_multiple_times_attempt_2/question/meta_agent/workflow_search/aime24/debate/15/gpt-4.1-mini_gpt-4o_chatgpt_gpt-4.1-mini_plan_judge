Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, we focus on the other three items. We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items, and 234 residents own exactly three of these items. The principle of inclusion-exclusion helps us find the number of residents who own at least one of the three items. However, the key point is that those who own exactly three items must also own the candy hearts, as everyone does. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as those who own exactly three of the other items, which is 234.

Answer:234
