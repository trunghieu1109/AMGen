Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are given four items: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Every resident owns candy hearts, so |C| = 900. The total number of residents is 900. The numbers owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. We want to find the number owning all four items (D, G, S, C). Let x be the number owning all four items. Let a be the number owning exactly one item, b = 437 (exactly two items), c = 234 (exactly three items), and d = x (exactly four items). Since total residents = 900, a + b + c + d = 900. So, a + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229. The sum of the sizes of the sets is |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. The total number of items owned is also equal to a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4 = 2024. Substitute a = 229 - x: (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + 4x = 2024. Simplify: 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024 => 1805 + 3x = 2024 => 3x = 219 => x = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.
