    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2Le7:
Let&#39;s define the sets:
D = set of residents who own a diamond ring = 195
G = set of residents who own golf clubs = 367
S = set of residents who own a garden spade = 562
C = set of residents who own a bag of candy hearts = 900 (all residents)

We are told:
- Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so C includes all 900 residents.
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.

We want to find the number of residents who own all four things.

Let x = number of residents who own all four things.

Since everyone owns candy hearts, the only way to have exactly one item is to own candy hearts and none of the other three items. Since candy hearts are owned by all, the minimal number of items owned is 1.

We have 900 residents.

Let’s define variables:
- a = number of residents who own exactly one of the first three items (D, G, S) plus candy hearts (so total 2 items including candy hearts)
- b = number of residents who own exactly two of the first three items plus candy hearts (so total 3 items including candy hearts)
- x = number of residents who own all four items.

Given:
- Number of residents owning exactly two items total = 437
- Number of residents owning exactly three items total = 234

But these numbers include candy hearts as one item, so:
- Exactly two items total means candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, S
- Exactly three items total means candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S
- Exactly four items total means candy hearts + all three of D, G, S

So:
- Residents owning exactly two items total = number owning candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, S = 437
- Residents owning exactly three items total = number owning candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S = 234
- Residents owning all four items = candy hearts + D + G + S = x

We want to find x.

Total residents = 900

Sum of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S = a
Sum of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S = b
Residents owning all three D, G, S = x

From the given:
- Residents owning exactly two items total (candy hearts + one of D, G, S) = a = 437
- Residents owning exactly three items total (candy hearts + two of D, G, S) = b = 234
- Residents owning all four items (candy hearts + D + G + S) = x = ?

Now, the total number of residents owning D is 195, which includes those who own exactly one of D, G, S (a), those who own exactly two of D, G, S (b), and those who own all three (x).

Similarly for G and S.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

We know:
- Number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S = a = 437
- Number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S = b = 234
- Number of residents owning all three D, G, S = x

Also, the total number of residents owning at least one of D, G, S is:
= a + b + x

Sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

Sum of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S = a = 437
Sum of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S = b = 234
Sum of residents owning all three D, G, S = x

Number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(sum of residents owning exactly two) - 3*(number owning all three)

But we can use the formula:

Total = a + b + x

From the sum of elements:

Sum of sizes = a + 2b + 3x = 1124

We know a = 437, b = 234, so:

437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124

437 + 468 + 3x = 1124

905 + 3x = 1124

3x = 1124 - 905 = 219

x = 219 / 3 = 73

Therefore, 73 residents own all four things.

Let&#39;s define the sets: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since every resident owns candy hearts). Total residents = 900. Also, 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three. We want to find the number who own all four items. 

Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. 

We know every resident owns candy hearts, so the set C includes all residents. So, owning all four items means owning D, G, S, and C. 

The number of residents owning exactly two items excludes those owning three or four items, similarly for those owning exactly three items. 

Sum of residents owning exactly one item + exactly two items + exactly three items + exactly four items = 900

Let a = number owning exactly one item, b = number owning exactly two items = 437, c = number owning exactly three items = 234, d = number owning exactly four items = x.

So, a + 437 + 234 + x = 900 =&gt; a + x = 229

Now, sum of sizes of sets = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024

Sum of sizes = sum of the counts of each item owned by residents.

Each person owning exactly one item contributes 1 to total count.
Each person owning exactly two items contributes 2 to total count.
Each person owning exactly three items contributes 3 to total count.
Each person owning exactly four items contributes 4 to total count.

So, total items owned = a*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4 = 2024

Substitute a = 229 - x:
(229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + 4x = 2024
229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024
229 + 874 + 702 + 3x = 2024
1805 + 3x = 2024
3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73

Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.

    <pre>We are given four items: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Every resident owns candy hearts, so |C| = 900. The total number of residents is 900. The numbers owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. We want to find the number owning all four items (D, G, S, C). Let x be the number owning all four items. Let a be the number owning exactly one item, b = 437 (exactly two items), c = 234 (exactly three items), and d = x (exactly four items). Since total residents = 900, a + b + c + d = 900. So, a + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229. The sum of the sizes of the sets is |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. The total number of items owned is also equal to a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4 = 2024. Substitute a = 229 - x: (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + 4x = 2024. Simplify: 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024 =&gt; 1805 + 3x = 2024 =&gt; 3x = 219 =&gt; x = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.
