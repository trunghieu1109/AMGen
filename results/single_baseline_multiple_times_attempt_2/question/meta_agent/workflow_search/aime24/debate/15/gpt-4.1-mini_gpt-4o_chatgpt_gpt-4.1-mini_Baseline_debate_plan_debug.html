    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent QPux:
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let&#39;s denote the sets as follows: D for diamond ring owners, G for golf club owners, and S for garden spade owners. We know the total number of residents is 900, and each owns a bag of candy hearts, so we need to find the number of residents who own all four items, including the candy hearts. We have the following data: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 (those who own all three items), and |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| = 437 (those who own exactly two items). The principle of inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| - |S ∩ D| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We also know that all 900 residents own a bag of candy hearts, so the number of residents who own at least one of the other three items is 900. Let&#39;s denote x as the number of residents who own all four items. Therefore, |D ∪ G ∪ S| + x = 900. First, we calculate |D ∪ G ∪ S| using the given data: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + 234. This gives us |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 921. Since |D ∪ G ∪ S| + x = 900, we can solve for x: 921 + x = 900, so x = 900 - 921.

We are given that all 900 residents own a bag of candy hearts. We need to find how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let&#39;s denote the number of people who own all four items as x. 

According to the problem, 437 own exactly two of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) and 234 own exactly three of these items. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. 

First, the total number of people who own at least one of the three items (not counting the candy hearts, since everyone owns them) is the sum of people who own one or more of the three items, minus those who own exactly two, plus those who own exactly three.

Let&#39;s denote:
A = number of people who own a diamond ring = 195
B = number of people who own a set of golf clubs = 367
C = number of people who own a garden spade = 562

The formula for inclusion-exclusion is:
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = A + B + C - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

We know that:
|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 (those who own exactly two of the items)
|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 (those who own exactly three of the items)

So, plugging in the values we have:
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + 234

This simplifies to:
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = 1390 - 437 + 234 = 1187

However, since we are only interested in those who own all four items, we need to consider that the total number of residents is 900, and all of them own candy hearts. Thus, the number of people who own none of the other three items is:
900 - |A ∪ B ∪ C|

Therefore, the number of people who own all four items is:
x = 900 - 1187

This results in a negative number which indicates a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the problem setup. Therefore, we should consider only those who own exactly three items, as all must own the candy hearts. Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is actually those who own exactly three items, which is 234.

    <pre>The problem involves finding the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, we focus on the other three items. We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items, and 234 residents own exactly three of these items. The principle of inclusion-exclusion helps us find the number of residents who own at least one of the three items. However, the key point is that those who own exactly three items must also own the candy hearts, as everyone does. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as those who own exactly three of the other items, which is 234.
