    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent Quci:
Let A, B, C, D be the sets of residents owning a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts respectively. We have |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562, |D|=900, total residents N=900. Let N_i be the number of residents owning exactly i items. We know N_2=437, N_3=234, N_4=x, and N_1=900−(437+234+x)=229−x. The sum of items owned is S=|A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=2024, which also equals N_1+2N_2+3N_3+4N_4=(229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=1805+3x. Setting 1805+3x=2024 gives x=73.

### thinking by Debate Agent ecWv:
Let A, B, C, D be the sets of owners of ring (195), golf clubs (367), spade (562), and candy hearts (900). Every resident owns hearts, so D=900 and universe=900. Let Ni be the number owning exactly i items. Given N2=437, N3=234, N4=x. Then N1 = 900−(437+234+x)=229−x. The sum of set sizes equals the sum over residents of how many sets they own: 195+367+562+900=2024. Also this equals 1·N1+2·N2+3·N3+4·N4 = (229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x. Compute: 229−x+874+702+4x = 1805+3x. Set 1805+3x=2024 ⇒3x=219 ⇒x=73.
