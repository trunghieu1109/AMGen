    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent e97R:
We have hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 =1.  A,C and B,D are opposite vertices of rhombus with diagonals intersecting at origin, so C=-A, D=-B.  Rhombus condition AB=BC gives A·B=0.  Then B=(x,y) must satisfy hyperbola and there must exist A on the hyperbola perpendicular to B.  Solving yields existence of A iff 6y^2&gt;5x^2; using hyperbola gives x^2&gt;720/11.  Then BD^2=4(x^2+y^2)=4((11/5)x^2-24)=(44/5)x^2-96, minimized as x^2→720/11 giving infimum BD^2=480, not attained but approached.  Thus the greatest real less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6Zhu:
We want points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 =1 that form a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at O.  In such a rhombus, if A=(u,v) and C=–A and B=(x,y) and D=–B, then the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, so A·B=0.  Both A and B lie on the hyperbola, so u^2/20–v^2/24=1 and x^2/20–y^2/24=1, and ux+vy=0.  The length squared of BD is |B–D|^2=|2B|^2=4(x^2+y^2).  Parametrize B by x=√20 cosh t, y=√24 sinh t.  Then the orthogonality condition yields a solvability constraint |tanh t|&gt;5/6.  Meanwhile
    x^2+y^2=20 cosh^2t+24 sinh^2t=20+44 sinh^2t,
so BD^2=4(x^2+y^2)=80+176 sinh^2t=80+176·(tanh^2t/(1–tanh^2t)).
As |tanh t|→5/6 from above, BD^2→80+176·((25/36)/(11/36))=80+176·(25/11)=80+400=480.
Since |tanh t| must exceed 5/6, BD^2&gt;480 for all such rhombi.  Thus the greatest real number less than BD^2 in every such case is the infimum 480.

    <pre>For a rhombus with vertices A=(u,v), B=(x,y), C=–A, D=–B on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 and diagonals intersecting at the origin, orthogonality of the diagonals gives u x + v y = 0. Both A and B satisfy the hyperbola equation. Solving for existence of A given B leads to the constraint x^2 &gt; 720/11, which in turn makes BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) approach 480 from above but never drop below it. Therefore the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.
