Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the maximum possible value of the square of the diagonal BD of a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The key is to understand that the diagonals of the rhombus are conjugate diameters of the hyperbola, and the maximum length of a diagonal occurs when it aligns with the transverse axis. The transverse axis of the hyperbola is along the x-axis, where the maximum x-coordinate is determined by setting \( y = 0 \) in the hyperbola equation, giving \( x^2 = 20 \). Thus, the maximum value of \( BD^2 \) is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \). Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 79.
