Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For a rhombus with vertices A=(u,v), B=(x,y), C=–A, D=–B on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 and diagonals intersecting at the origin, orthogonality of the diagonals gives u x + v y = 0. Both A and B satisfy the hyperbola equation. Solving for existence of A given B leads to the constraint x^2 > 720/11, which in turn makes BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) approach 480 from above but never drop below it. Therefore the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.
