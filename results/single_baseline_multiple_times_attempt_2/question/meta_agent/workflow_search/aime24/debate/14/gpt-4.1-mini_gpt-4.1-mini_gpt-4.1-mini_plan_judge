Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves points on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The vertices can be represented as \( \pm \vec{u} \) and \( \pm \vec{v} \), where \( \vec{u} = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( \vec{v} = (x_2, y_2) \) lie on the hyperbola. The rhombus condition implies all sides are equal, which leads to \( |\vec{u} - \vec{v}| = |\vec{u} + \vec{v}| \), and hence \( \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \), so \( \vec{u} \) and \( \vec{v} \) are perpendicular. Using the hyperbola parametrization \( x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t, y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t \), the orthogonality condition becomes \( 20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{5}{6} \). The length squared of diagonal \( BD \) is \( 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4(20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s) = 80 + 176 \sinh^2 s \). Using the inequality from the orthogonality condition, \( \sinh^2 s > \frac{25}{11} \), so the minimal possible \( BD^2 \) is \( 80 + 176 \times \frac{25}{11} = 480 \). This means for all such rhombi, \( BD^2 > 480 \), so the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 480. The alternative answer 64 is inconsistent with the derived inequalities and the hyperbola parameters. Therefore, the correct answer is 480.
