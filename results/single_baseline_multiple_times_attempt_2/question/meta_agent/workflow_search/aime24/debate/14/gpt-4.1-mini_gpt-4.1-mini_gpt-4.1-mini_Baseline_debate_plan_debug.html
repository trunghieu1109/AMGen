    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent C9ge:
Given the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), points \(A, B, C, D\) form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other and intersect at the origin, the diagonals are vectors \(\vec{BD} = 2\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{AC} = 2\vec{u}\) for some vectors \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) originating from the origin. The vertices are then \( \pm \vec{u} \) and \( \pm \vec{v} \). The rhombus condition means all sides are equal in length, so \(|\vec{u} - \vec{v}| = |\vec{u} + \vec{v}| \). This implies \( \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \), so \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) are perpendicular vectors.

Since \(A, B, C, D\) lie on the hyperbola, \(\vec{u} = (x_1, y_1)\), \(\vec{v} = (x_2, y_2)\) satisfy the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1, \quad \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1.
\]

Also, \(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0\).

We want to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\), i.e., \(4|\vec{v}|^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\), that holds for all such rhombi.

Step 1: Parametrize points on the hyperbola. Let \(x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t\), \(y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t\). Then the hyperbola equation is satisfied.

So \(\vec{u} = (\sqrt{20} \cosh t, \sqrt{24} \sinh t)\), \(\vec{v} = (\sqrt{20} \cosh s, \sqrt{24} \sinh s)\).

Step 2: Orthogonality condition:
\[
\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \implies \sqrt{20} \cosh t \cdot \sqrt{20} \cosh s + \sqrt{24} \sinh t \cdot \sqrt{24} \sinh s = 0
\]
\[
20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0
\]

Using hyperbolic identities:
\[
20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0
\]
\[
20 \cosh t \cosh s = -24 \sinh t \sinh s
\]

Divide both sides by \(\cosh t \cosh s\) (nonzero):
\[
20 = -24 \tanh t \tanh s
\]
\[
\tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{20}{24} = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

Step 3: We want to find the minimal possible \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4(20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s)\).

Note that:
\[
20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s = 20 + 20 \sinh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s = 20 + 44 \sinh^2 s
\]

So:
\[
BD^2 = 4(20 + 44 \sinh^2 s) = 80 + 176 \sinh^2 s
\]

Step 4: Using \(\tanh t \tanh s = -5/6\), express \(\tanh t = -\frac{5}{6 \tanh s}\).

Since \(\tanh^2 t &lt; 1\), we have:
\[
\tanh^2 t = \frac{25}{36 \tanh^2 s} &lt; 1 \implies \tanh^2 s &gt; \frac{25}{36}
\]

Step 5: \(\tanh s = \frac{\sinh s}{\cosh s} = \frac{\sinh s}{\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 s}}\). Let \(x = \sinh^2 s \geq 0\).

Then:
\[
\tanh^2 s = \frac{x}{1+x} &gt; \frac{25}{36}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(1+x\):
\[
x &gt; \frac{25}{36} (1 + x) = \frac{25}{36} + \frac{25}{36} x
\]

Bring terms together:
\[
x - \frac{25}{36} x &gt; \frac{25}{36} \implies x \left(1 - \frac{25}{36}\right) &gt; \frac{25}{36}
\]
\[
x \cdot \frac{11}{36} &gt; \frac{25}{36} \implies x &gt; \frac{25}{11}
\]

Step 6: Recall \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 x\). Since \(x &gt; \frac{25}{11}\), the minimal value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
80 + 176 \cdot \frac{25}{11} = 80 + 16 \cdot 25 = 80 + 400 = 480
\]

Therefore, for all such rhombi, \(BD^2 &gt; 480\). The greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(480\).

### thinking by Debate Agent ySTn:
Given the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), points \(A, B, C, D\) form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Let the diagonals be \(AC\) and \(BD\). If \(B = (x, y)\), then \(D = (-x, -y)\) because the origin is the midpoint of \(BD\). Similarly, if \(A = (u, v)\), then \(C = (-u, -v)\). Since \(A, B, C, D\) lie on the hyperbola, \(A\) and \(B\) satisfy \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1 \). The rhombus condition means all sides are equal in length. The sides are \(AB, BC, CD, DA\). The length of side \(AB\) is \(\sqrt{(x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2}\), and length of side \(BC\) is \(\sqrt{(x+u)^2 + (y+v)^2}\) because \(C = (-u, -v)\). Setting \(AB = BC\) gives the relation \((x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2 = (x+u)^2 + (y+v)^2\). Simplifying, we get \(-4xu - 4yv = 0\) or \(xu + yv = 0\). The diagonals are vectors \(AC = (-2u, -2v)\) and \(BD = (-2x, -2y)\). The diagonals are perpendicular if \(AC \cdot BD = 0\), so \((-2u)(-2x) + (-2v)(-2y) = 4(xu + yv) = 0\), which matches the previous condition. So the diagonals are perpendicular. The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). We want to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\) for all such rhombi. Using the condition \(xu + yv = 0\) and that both points are on the hyperbola, we can parametrize the hyperbola: \(x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t, y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t\) and similarly for \(u, v\). Using the perpendicularity condition and the hyperbola equation, after algebraic manipulation, the problem reduces to maximizing \(x^2 + y^2\) under the given constraints. The maximum value of \(BD^2\) found is 64. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 64.

    <pre>The problem involves points on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The vertices can be represented as \( \pm \vec{u} \) and \( \pm \vec{v} \), where \( \vec{u} = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( \vec{v} = (x_2, y_2) \) lie on the hyperbola. The rhombus condition implies all sides are equal, which leads to \( |\vec{u} - \vec{v}| = |\vec{u} + \vec{v}| \), and hence \( \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \), so \( \vec{u} \) and \( \vec{v} \) are perpendicular. Using the hyperbola parametrization \( x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t, y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t \), the orthogonality condition becomes \( 20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{5}{6} \). The length squared of diagonal \( BD \) is \( 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4(20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s) = 80 + 176 \sinh^2 s \). Using the inequality from the orthogonality condition, \( \sinh^2 s &gt; \frac{25}{11} \), so the minimal possible \( BD^2 \) is \( 80 + 176 \times \frac{25}{11} = 480 \). This means for all such rhombi, \( BD^2 &gt; 480 \), so the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 480. The alternative answer 64 is inconsistent with the derived inequalities and the hyperbola parameters. Therefore, the correct answer is 480.
