    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

### thinking by Debate Agent mAoP:
To solve this problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron is isosceles with respect to its diagonals, which implies a certain symmetry. The condition that the distances from the point I to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are equal suggests that I is the incenter of the tetrahedron, and the tetrahedron is likely semi-regular or possesses a high degree of symmetry. We can use the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron, which is given by the volume of the tetrahedron divided by the sum of its face areas. We first calculate the volume using the given side lengths and then calculate the areas of the faces. The side lengths suggest that the faces are right triangles or close to being right triangles. After calculating the volume and the face areas, we can find the inradius and express it in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \). We then identify m, n, and p, ensuring m and p are relatively prime and n is square-free, and sum these values to find m+n+p.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ur0U:
The problem describes a tetrahedron with all opposite edges equal, which means it is an orthocentric tetrahedron. The point I, equidistant from all faces, is the orthocenter of the tetrahedron. The formula for the distance from the orthocenter to a face of an orthocentric tetrahedron is given by \( \frac{3V}{S} \), where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( S \) is the area of the face. We first calculate the volume \( V \) using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, \( V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - a^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) - b^2(B^2 + C^2 + A^2) - c^2(C^2 + A^2 + B^2) + A^2B^2 + B^2C^2 + C^2A^2} \), where \( a, b, c \) are the lengths of the edges meeting at a vertex and \( A, B, C \) are the lengths of the opposite edges. Here, \( a = b = c = \sqrt{89} \) and \( A = B = C = \sqrt{80} \). Substituting these values, we find \( V = 60 \). Next, we calculate the area \( S \) of one face, such as \( \triangle ABC \), using Heron&#39;s formula. The sides of \( \triangle ABC \) are \( \sqrt{80}, \sqrt{89}, \sqrt{89} \). The semi-perimeter \( s \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{89}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80}}{2} \). The area \( S \) is \( \sqrt{s(s-\sqrt{80})(s-\sqrt{89})(s-\sqrt{89})} \). Simplifying, we find \( S = 40 \). Finally, the distance from the orthocenter to a face is \( \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times 60}{40} = \frac{9}{2} \). This is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) with \( m = 9, n = 1, p = 2 \). Therefore, \( m+n+p = 9+1+2 = 12 \).
