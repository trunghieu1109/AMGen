Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The tetrahedron described is an orthocentric tetrahedron because all opposite edges are equal. The point I, equidistant from all faces, is the orthocenter. The distance from the orthocenter to a face is given by the formula \( \frac{3V}{S} \), where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( S \) is the area of one face. We calculate the volume \( V \) using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The edges meeting at a vertex are \( \sqrt{89} \), and the opposite edges are \( \sqrt{80} \). Substituting these values, we find \( V = 60 \). The area \( S \) of a face, such as \( \triangle ABC \), is calculated using Heron's formula. The sides of \( \triangle ABC \) are \( \sqrt{80}, \sqrt{89}, \sqrt{89} \). The semi-perimeter \( s \) is \( \frac{2\sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80}}{2} \). The area \( S \) is \( 40 \). The distance from the orthocenter to a face is \( \frac{3 \times 60}{40} = \frac{9}{2} \). This is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) with \( m = 9, n = 1, p = 2 \). Therefore, \( m+n+p = 9+1+2 = 12 \).
