    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

### thinking by Debate Agent fsWK:
We seek the inradius r of the given isosceles tetrahedron with opposite edges equal.  For any tetrahedron, r=3V/S where V is its volume and S its total surface area.  Here each face is congruent with side‐lengths √41,√80,√89, so each has area A=6√21 and S=4A=24√21.  Use coordinates A=(0,0,0), B=(√41,0,0), C in the xy‐plane determined by BC^2=89, AC^2=80, and D above the plane with AD^2=89, BD^2=80, CD^2=41.  One finds V=(1/6)|det(AB,AC,AD)|=2√21·w where w is D’s z‐coordinate.  Solving yields w^2=441094400/13026069, whence w=√(441094400/13026069).  Then r=w/4 simplifies to r=20√21/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63 and m+n+p=104.

### thinking by Debate Agent S4h3:
We note the tetrahedron has three pairs of equal opposite edges (AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c), so all four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41,√80,√89.  Heron’s formula gives each face area =6√21, so total surface area A=24√21.  The volume of an &#34;isosceles&#34; tetrahedron with opposite edges a,b,c is V=√[4a²b²c²–a²(b²+c²–a²)²–b²(c²+a²–b²)²–c²(a²+b²–c²)²+(b²+c²–a²)(c²+a²–b²)(a²+b²–c²)]/12.  Substituting a²=41,b²=80,c²=89 yields V=160/3.  Hence the inradius r=3V/A=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63.  Here m=20,n=21,p=63, so m+n+p=20+21+63=104.

    <pre>The tetrahedron has three pairs of equal opposite edges, so all four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41, √80, √89.  Using Heron’s formula, each face area is 6√21, so the total surface area is S=4·6√21=24√21.  The volume of such an “isosceles” tetrahedron can be computed by the general Cayley–Menger or specialized formula, yielding V=160/3.  The inradius is r=3V/S=(3·(160/3))/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63.  Thus m=20, n=21, p=63 and m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.
