Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem gives a tetrahedron ABCD with edges AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. We want the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the inradius r of the tetrahedron. The inradius is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. By placing the tetrahedron in coordinate space and using the given edge lengths, we find coordinates for points A, B, C, and D. Calculating the volume V using the scalar triple product and the surface area S using Heron's formula for each face, we find V = 160/3 and S = 110. Thus, r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3)/110 = 160/110 = 16/11. Expressed in the form (m√n)/p, this is (16√1)/11, so m=16, n=1, p=11. The sum m+n+p = 16+1+11 = 28.
