Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The tetrahedron has three pairs of equal opposite edges, so all four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41, √80, √89.  Using Heron’s formula, each face area is 6√21, so the total surface area is S=4·6√21=24√21.  The volume of such an “isosceles” tetrahedron can be computed by the general Cayley–Menger or specialized formula, yielding V=160/3.  The inradius is r=3V/S=(3·(160/3))/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63.  Thus m=20, n=21, p=63 and m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.
