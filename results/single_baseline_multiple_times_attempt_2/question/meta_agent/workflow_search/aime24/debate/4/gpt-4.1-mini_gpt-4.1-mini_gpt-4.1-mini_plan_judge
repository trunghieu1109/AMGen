Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We want the least prime p such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some positive integer n, and then find the least such positive integer m with m^4 + 1 divisible by p^2. Checking small primes: p=2 and p=3 fail. For p=5, no n satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 mod 25. For p=7, no solution mod 49. Using number theory, if n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2, then the order of n mod p^2 is 8, so 8 divides φ(p^2) = p(p-1). The smallest prime p with 8 dividing p(p-1) is p=17. Mod 17, solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 exist. Using Hensel's lemma, these solutions lift uniquely to mod 289. Solving the congruence, the least positive integer m is found to be 155. Therefore, the least prime p is 17, and the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is 155.
