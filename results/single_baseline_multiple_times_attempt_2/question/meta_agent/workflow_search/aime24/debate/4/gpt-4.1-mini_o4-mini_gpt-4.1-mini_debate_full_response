Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent mAaH', content='We need the smallest prime p for which there is an integer n with n^4≡–1 mod p^2. Testing small primes 2,3,5,7,11,13 fails; p=17 is the first that works since 2^4+1=17, so 2^4≡–1 mod17. Lifting solutions of x^4≡–1 mod17 via Hensel’s lemma to mod17^2=289 yields four lifts. Solving m=a+17k so that m^4+1≡0 mod289 for each residue a∈{2,8,9,15} gives m∈{155,110,179,134}. The least positive is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Checking small primes shows p=17 is the least for which x^4≡−1 mod17 has solutions, and Hensel lifting gives the unique lifts mod17^2. Among those lifts the least positive is 110. Thus m=110.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent z1YD:\nWe seek the smallest prime p for which p^2 divides n^4+1 for some n>0. Test small primes: for p=2,3,5,7,11,13 none admit n^4≡–1 mod\u2009p^2. For p=17, we have n^4≡–1 mod\u200917 has solutions n≡2,8,9,15 mod\u200917, and Hensel’s lemma lifts each to a unique solution mod\u200917^2=289. Thus p=17 is the least prime.\n\nNext, to find the least positive m with m^4+1≡0 mod\u2009289, lift each solution a mod\u200917 to mod\u2009289 by solving m=a+17k in the linearization f(m)=m^4+1≡f(a)+f'(a)·17k≡0 mod\u2009289. Doing this for a=2,8,9,15 yields m=155,110,179,134 respectively. The smallest of these is 110.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zcWv:\n110\n\n### answer by Debate Agent z1YD:\n110\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
