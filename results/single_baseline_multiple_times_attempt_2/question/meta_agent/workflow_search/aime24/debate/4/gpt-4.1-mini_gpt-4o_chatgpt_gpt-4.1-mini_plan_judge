proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n with p^2 dividing n^4 + 1. We start by considering the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), which implies n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2). The order of n modulo p^2 must divide 8, and since n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4, so it must be 8. This means p^2 must divide n^8 - 1, and since p^2 divides n^4 + 1, it cannot divide n^4 - 1. We check small primes to find when -1 is a quartic residue modulo p^2. For p = 5, we find that 5^2 divides n^4 + 1 for n = 5, as 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, p = 5 is the least prime, and m = 5 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2.
