Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest prime p for which there is an integer n with n^4≡–1 mod p^2. Testing small primes 2,3,5,7,11,13 fails; p=17 is the first that works since 2^4+1=17, so 2^4≡–1 mod17. Lifting solutions of x^4≡–1 mod17 via Hensel’s lemma to mod17^2=289 yields four lifts. Solving m=a+17k so that m^4+1≡0 mod289 for each residue a∈{2,8,9,15} gives m∈{155,110,179,134}. The least positive is 110.
