    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking by Debate Agent zcWv:
We seek the smallest odd prime p such that x^4≡−1 mod p^2 has a solution. Checking small primes shows p=17 is the least for which x^4≡−1 mod17 has solutions, and Hensel lifting gives the unique lifts mod17^2. Among those lifts the least positive is 110. Thus m=110.

### thinking by Debate Agent z1YD:
We seek the smallest prime p for which p^2 divides n^4+1 for some n&gt;0. Test small primes: for p=2,3,5,7,11,13 none admit n^4≡–1 mod p^2. For p=17, we have n^4≡–1 mod 17 has solutions n≡2,8,9,15 mod 17, and Hensel’s lemma lifts each to a unique solution mod 17^2=289. Thus p=17 is the least prime.

Next, to find the least positive m with m^4+1≡0 mod 289, lift each solution a mod 17 to mod 289 by solving m=a+17k in the linearization f(m)=m^4+1≡f(a)+f&#39;(a)·17k≡0 mod 289. Doing this for a=2,8,9,15 yields m=155,110,179,134 respectively. The smallest of these is 110.

    <pre>We need the smallest prime p for which there is an integer n with n^4≡–1 mod p^2. Testing small primes 2,3,5,7,11,13 fails; p=17 is the first that works since 2^4+1=17, so 2^4≡–1 mod17. Lifting solutions of x^4≡–1 mod17 via Hensel’s lemma to mod17^2=289 yields four lifts. Solving m=a+17k so that m^4+1≡0 mod289 for each residue a∈{2,8,9,15} gives m∈{155,110,179,134}. The least positive is 110.
