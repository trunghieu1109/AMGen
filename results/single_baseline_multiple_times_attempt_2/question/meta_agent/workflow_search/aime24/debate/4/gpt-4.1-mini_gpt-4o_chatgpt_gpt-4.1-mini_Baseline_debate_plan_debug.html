    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking by Debate Agent E3Di:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the least prime number $p$ such that there exists a positive integer $n$ with $p^2 \mid n^4 + 1$. A key observation is that if $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$, then $n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$. This implies that the order of $n$ modulo $p^2$ must divide 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. For $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$, the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4, so it must be 8. Therefore, $p^2$ must divide $n^8 - 1$. We also note that $n^8 - 1 = (n^4 - 1)(n^4 + 1)$, so $p^2$ must divide either $n^4 - 1$ or $n^4 + 1$. However, since $p^2$ divides $n^4 + 1$, it cannot divide $n^4 - 1$, as $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$. So $p^2$ must divide $2n^4$. The smallest prime $p$ where $-1$ is a quartic residue modulo $p^2$ is $p = 5$. For $p = 5$, we need to find $n$ such that $5^2 \mid n^4 + 1$. Now let&#39;s test small values of $n$.\n\nFor $n = 1$, $1^4 + 1 = 2$, not divisible by 25.\nFor $n = 2$, $2^4 + 1 = 17$, not divisible by 25.\nFor $n = 3$, $3^4 + 1 = 82$, not divisible by 25.\nFor $n = 4$, $4^4 + 1 = 257$, not divisible by 25.\nFor $n = 5$, $5^4 + 1 = 626$, and 626 is divisible by 25.\nTherefore, $m = 5$ is the least positive integer such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $5^2$.

To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by considering the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2), meaning the order of n modulo p^2 must divide 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Since n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), n cannot have order 1 or 2. It must have order 4 or 8. If n has order 4, then n^2 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), and if n has order 8, then n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Thus, n^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) is a necessary condition. We check small primes to see when this condition is satisfied. For p = 2, n^2 ≡ -1 (mod 2) is not possible. For p = 3, n^2 ≡ -1 (mod 3) means n^2 ≡ 2 (mod 3), which is not possible since 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3. For p = 5, n^2 ≡ -1 (mod 5) means n^2 ≡ 4 (mod 5), which is possible since 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 5). We then check if n^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2. We find that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25) is satisfied by n = 3 and m = 7. Therefore, p = 5 is the least prime number, and m = 7 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

For p = 5, we find that 5^2 divides n^4 + 1 for n = 5, as 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, p = 5 is the least prime, and m = 5 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2.
