Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from S. The total number of 4-element subsets of S is C(10,4) = 210. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are in the winning set, and wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers match the winning set exactly. We want the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. The number of winning sets with intersection size k with Jen's set is C(4,k)*C(6,4-k). For k=2,3,4, these are 90, 24, and 1 respectively, summing to 115. The probability of winning a prize is 115/210, and the probability of winning the grand prize is 1/210. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. Hence, m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.
