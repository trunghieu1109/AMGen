    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent U1mz:
We need P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand and prize)/P(prize). Since grand prize (all 4 match) implies prize, P(grand|prize) = P(grand)/P(prize).
Total ways to draw 4 from 10: C(10,4)=210.
P(grand) = 1/210 (only one draw equals Jen’s pick).
P(prize) = P(at least 2 matches) = [C(4,2)C(6,2) + C(4,3)C(6,1) + C(4,4)C(6,0)]/210 = (6*15 + 4*6 + 1)/210 = 115/210.
Thus P = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. So m+n = 1+115 = 116.

### thinking by Debate Agent JoJt:
First, note there are C(10,4)=210 equally likely draws. For a fixed chosen set of 4 numbers, the number of draws that match exactly k of them is C(4,k)·C(6,4−k). So: k=2 gives 6·15=90 ways; k=3 gives 4·6=24 ways; k=4 gives 1·1=1 way. Thus the total ways to win any prize (k≥2) is 90+24+1=115, so P(win prize)=115/210. The grand prize (k=4) occurs in 1 way, so P(grand)=1/210. Hence the conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115, so m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.
