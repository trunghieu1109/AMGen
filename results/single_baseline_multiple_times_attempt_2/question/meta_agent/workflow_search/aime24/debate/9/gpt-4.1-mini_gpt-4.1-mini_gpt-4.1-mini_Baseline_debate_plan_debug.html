    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent NFDD:
Step 1: Total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from S (size 10) is C(10,4).

Step 2: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. Let her chosen set be J.

Step 3: The lottery randomly chooses 4 distinct numbers from S. Let the chosen set be L.

Step 4: Jen wins a prize if |J ∩ L| ≥ 2, and wins the grand prize if |J ∩ L| = 4 (i.e., L = J).

Step 5: We want P(grand prize | prize) = P(|J ∩ L|=4) / P(|J ∩ L|≥2).

Step 6: Since Jen&#39;s choice J is fixed, the randomness is over L chosen uniformly from all C(10,4) subsets.

Step 7: Calculate P(|J ∩ L|=4) = Number of L with intersection 4 / total = 1 / C(10,4).

Step 8: Calculate P(|J ∩ L|≥2) = sum over k=2 to 4 of P(|J ∩ L|=k).

Step 9: For intersection size k, the number of L sets is C(4,k)*C(6,4-k) because:
- Choose k numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers (C(4,k))
- Choose remaining 4-k numbers from the other 6 numbers (C(6,4-k))

Step 10: Calculate total number of L sets with intersection size ≥ 2:
C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)
= 6*15 + 4*6 + 1*1 = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

Step 11: Total number of L sets is C(10,4) = 210.

Step 12: So, P(|J ∩ L|≥2) = 115/210 = 23/42.

Step 13: P(|J ∩ L|=4) = 1/210.

Step 14: Therefore, P(grand prize | prize) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = 42/(210*23) = (42/210)*(1/23) = (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115.

Step 15: The fraction m/n = 1/115, so m=1, n=115, m+n=116.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZFLV:
First, the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from S = {1, 2, ..., 10} is C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. The winning numbers are also 4 distinct numbers from S.

She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are in the winning 4 numbers.

She wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers match the winning numbers exactly.

We are to find P(grand prize | won a prize).

Step 1: Total number of possible winning sets: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: The number of winning sets where Jen&#39;s 4 numbers are exactly the winning numbers is 1 (only one way, the exact set she picked).

Step 3: The number of winning sets where Jen wins a prize (at least 2 matching numbers) is the number of 4-element subsets of S that share at least 2 elements with Jen&#39;s chosen 4-element subset.

We need to count how many 4-subsets of S intersect Jen&#39;s 4-subset in at least 2 elements.

Let Jen&#39;s chosen set be A with |A|=4.

We want to count the number of 4-subsets B of S such that |A ∩ B| ≥ 2.

We can count the number of 4-subsets B with intersection size k = 0,1,2,3,4 and sum for k≥2.

Total 4-subsets = 210.

Number of subsets with intersection size k:
- For k=0: choose 0 from A and 4 from S\A (size 6) =&gt; C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1*15 = 15
- For k=1: choose 1 from A and 3 from S\A =&gt; C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80
- For k=2: choose 2 from A and 2 from S\A =&gt; C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90
- For k=3: choose 3 from A and 1 from S\A =&gt; C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24
- For k=4: choose 4 from A and 0 from S\A =&gt; C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1

Check sum: 15 + 80 + 90 + 24 + 1 = 210, correct.

So the number of winning sets where Jen wins a prize (k≥2) is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Step 4: Probability of grand prize given that she won a prize is:

P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So the fraction is 1/115, and m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.

For k=2,3,4, these are 90, 24, and 1 respectively, summing to 115. The probability of winning a prize is 115/210, and the probability of winning the grand prize is 1/210. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. Hence, m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.
