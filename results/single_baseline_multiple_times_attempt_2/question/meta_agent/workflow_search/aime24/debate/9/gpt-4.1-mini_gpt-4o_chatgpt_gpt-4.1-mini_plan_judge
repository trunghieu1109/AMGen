Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, which is C(10, 4) = 210. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We calculate the number of ways she can match exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers. For exactly 2 matches, she chooses 2 numbers from the 4 chosen numbers and 2 numbers from the 6 not chosen: C(4, 2) * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90. For exactly 3 matches, she chooses 3 numbers from the 4 chosen numbers and 1 number from the 6 not chosen: C(4, 3) * C(6, 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. For exactly 4 matches, she chooses all 4 numbers from the 4 chosen numbers: C(4, 4) = 1. The total number of ways to win a prize is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The number of ways to win the grand prize is 1. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
