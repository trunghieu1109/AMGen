    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking by Debate Agent pVQK:
We seek the largest 4-digit N=abcd such that replacing any single digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Let positions be weights mod 7: 10^3≡6,10^2≡2,10≡3,1≡1. For each position i, replacing that digit by 1 gives a congruence. Writing these four congruences and eliminating the replacement digit via modular arithmetic gives a system for (a,b,c,d):
1)2b+3c+d≡1
2)6a+3c+d≡5
3)6a+2b+d≡4
4)6a+2b+3c≡6  (all mod 7)
Eliminate d: from (1) d≡1−2b−3c. Sub into (2),(3),(4), leading to three linear congruences in a,b,c:
a+2b≡3,  a+3c≡4,  a−2b−3c≡1  (mod 7).
Solve: b≡6,c≡2 or 9,a≡5 (only digits in range). Then d≡4. So N=5624 or 5694. The larger is 5694. Divide by 1000: quotient Q=5, remainder R=694, so Q+R=699.

### thinking by Debate Agent t6KG:
We want the greatest 4‐digit N=ABCD such that replacing any one digit by 1 gives a multiple of 7.  If M1 substitutes A→1, M1=N−1000(A−1) must be ≡0 mod7, etc.  Writing all four congruences mod7:  N≡1000(A−1), N≡100(B−1), N≡10(C−1), N≡(D−1) leads to the linear system
 2B+3C+D≡1,
 6A+3C+D≡5,
 6A+2B+D≡4,
 6A+2B+3C≡6  (all mod7).
Solving in A,B,C,D mod7 (then lifting into digits 0–9) gives A≡5, B≡6, C≡2 or 9, D≡4.  The larger choice C=9 yields N=5694.  Checking replacements: 1694, 5194, 5614, 5691 are all divisible by 7.  Thus N=5694, Q=N//1000=5, R=694, so Q+R=699.

    <pre>We seek the largest 4-digit N = ABCD such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Writing the four congruences modulo 7 for replacements at A, B, C, D leads to a linear system in A,B,C,D mod 7. Solving gives A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, so N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.
