Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek the largest 4-digit N = ABCD such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Writing the four congruences modulo 7 for replacements at A, B, C, D leads to a linear system in A,B,C,D mod 7. Solving gives A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, so N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.
