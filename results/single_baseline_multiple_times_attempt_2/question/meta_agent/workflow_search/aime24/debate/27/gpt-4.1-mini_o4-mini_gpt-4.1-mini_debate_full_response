Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 0MxE', content='We seek the largest 4-digit N = ABCD such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Writing the four congruences modulo 7 for replacements at A, B, C, D leads to a linear system in A,B,C,D mod 7. Solving gives A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, so N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Let positions be weights mod 7: 10^3≡6,10^2≡2,10≡3,1≡1. For each position i, replacing that digit by 1 gives a congruence. Writing these four congruences and eliminating the replacement digit via modular arithmetic gives a system for (a,b,c,d):\n1)2b+3c+d≡1\n2)6a+3c+d≡5\n3)6a+2b+d≡4\n4)6a+2b+3c≡6  (all mod 7)\nEliminate d: from (1) d≡1−2b−3c. Sub into (2),(3),(4), leading to three linear congruences in a,b,c:\na+2b≡3,  a+3c≡4,  a−2b−3c≡1  (mod 7).\nSolve: b≡6,c≡2 or 9,a≡5 (only digits in range). Then d≡4. So N=5624 or 5694. The larger is 5694. Divide by 1000: quotient Q=5, remainder R=694, so Q+R=699.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent t6KG:\nWe want the greatest 4‐digit N=ABCD such that replacing any one digit by 1 gives a multiple of 7.  If M1 substitutes A→1, M1=N−1000(A−1) must be ≡0 mod7, etc.  Writing all four congruences mod7:  N≡1000(A−1), N≡100(B−1), N≡10(C−1), N≡(D−1) leads to the linear system\n 2B+3C+D≡1,\n 6A+3C+D≡5,\n 6A+2B+D≡4,\n 6A+2B+3C≡6  (all mod7).\nSolving in A,B,C,D mod7 (then lifting into digits 0–9) gives A≡5, B≡6, C≡2 or 9, D≡4.  The larger choice C=9 yields N=5694.  Checking replacements: 1694, 5194, 5614, 5691 are all divisible by 7.  Thus N=5694, Q=N//1000=5, R=694, so Q+R=699.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pVQK:\n699\n\n### answer by Debate Agent t6KG:\n699\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
