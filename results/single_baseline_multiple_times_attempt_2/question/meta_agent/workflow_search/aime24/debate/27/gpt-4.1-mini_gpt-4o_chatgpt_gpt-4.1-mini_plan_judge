Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start by considering the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check if changing each digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. If not, we decrement N and check again until we find such a number. After finding N, we calculate Q and R by dividing N by 1000, and finally find Q+R. The correct N is 9983, as changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7: 1983, 9183, 9913, and 9981 are all divisible by 7. Dividing 9983 by 1000 gives Q = 9 and R = 983, so Q + R = 9 + 983 = 992.
