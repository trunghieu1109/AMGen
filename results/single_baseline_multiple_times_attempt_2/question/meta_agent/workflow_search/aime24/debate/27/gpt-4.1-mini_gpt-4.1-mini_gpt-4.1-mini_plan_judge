Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. By analyzing the modular conditions and using the properties of modulo 7 arithmetic, we derive a system of congruences relating the digits a, b, c, d. Solving these congruences modulo 7 and considering digit constraints (0-9 for b,c,d and 1-9 for a), we find candidate numbers for each residue class k mod 7. Checking these candidates for the divisibility condition reveals that only N=5694 satisfies all conditions. For N=5694, changing any digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. Finally, dividing N by 1000 gives quotient Q=5 and remainder R=694, so Q+R=699.
