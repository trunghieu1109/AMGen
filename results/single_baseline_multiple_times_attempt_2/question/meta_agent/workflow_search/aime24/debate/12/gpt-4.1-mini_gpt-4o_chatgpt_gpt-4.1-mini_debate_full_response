We can write z = 4e^(iθ) = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). The expression we want to maximize is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Substitute z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ) into the expression.\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) + (96 + 144i)/(4(cosθ + i sinθ)).\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\n= 300cosθ + 468i cosθ + 300i sinθ - 468 sinθ.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(300cosθ - 468sinθ) + i(468cosθ + 300sinθ).\n\nNow, simplify the second term:\n\n(96 + 144i)/(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) = (96 + 144i)/(4e^(iθ)) = (96 + 144i)/(4(cosθ + i sinθ)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n= ((96 + 144i)(4cosθ - 4i sinθ))/(16).\n\n= (384cosθ - 576sinθ + 576i cosθ + 384i sinθ)/16.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(24cosθ - 36sinθ) + i(36cosθ + 24sinθ).\n\nNow, add the real parts and the imaginary parts of both expressions:\n\nReal part: 300cosθ - 468sinθ + 24cosθ - 36sinθ = 324cosθ - 504sinθ.\n\nTo maximize the real part, we find the maximum value of 324cosθ - 504sinθ.\n\nThis is of the form Rcos(θ + α), where R = sqrt(324^2 + 504^2) and α is such that cosα = 324/R and sinα = -504/R.\n\nCalculate R:\n\nR = sqrt(324^2 + 504^2) = sqrt(104976 + 254016) = sqrt(358992) = 598.\n\nThe maximum value of Rcos(θ + α) is R, which is 598.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vjHL:\nLet $z = re^{i\\theta}$ where $r = |z| = 4$. Then $z = 4e^{i\\theta} = 4(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$. The expression becomes $(75 + 117i)(4e^{i\\theta}) + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}$. Simplifying, we have $300e^{i\\theta} + 468ie^{i\\theta} + \\frac{24}{e^{i\\theta}} + \\frac{36i}{e^{i\\theta}}$. This can be rewritten as $300(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) + 468i(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) + 24(\\cos(-\\theta) + i\\sin(-\\theta)) + 36i(\\cos(-\\theta) + i\\sin(-\\theta))$. Simplifying further, the real part is $300\\cos\\theta + 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta$. Thus, the real part is $324\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta$. To maximize this, we use the identity $R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi)$ where $R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 36^2} = 324\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{36}{324}\\right)^2} = 324\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{81}} = 324\\sqrt{\\frac{82}{81}} = 324\\frac{\\sqrt{82}}{9} = 36\\sqrt{82}$. The maximum value of $R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi)$ is $R$, so the largest possible real part is $36\\sqrt{82}$.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9zFP:\n598\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vjHL:\n324\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
