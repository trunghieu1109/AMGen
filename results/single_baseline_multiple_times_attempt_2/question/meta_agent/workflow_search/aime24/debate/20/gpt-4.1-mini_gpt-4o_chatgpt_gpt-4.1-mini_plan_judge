Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To determine the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and these two digits sum to the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as ab + c, where a and c are the digits and 0 <= a, c < b. The sum of the digits is a + c, and we need a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = (a + c)^2. The number n should also be a two-digit number in base b, meaning b <= ab + c < b^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten values of a and c satisfying these conditions. By testing small values of b, we find that for b = 5, there are 11 solutions, which is more than ten. For b = 4, there are only 6 solutions, and for b = 3, there are only 3 solutions. Therefore, the smallest b is 5.
