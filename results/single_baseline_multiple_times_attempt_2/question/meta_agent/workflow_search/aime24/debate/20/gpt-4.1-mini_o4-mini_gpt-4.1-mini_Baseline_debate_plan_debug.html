    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent eNpU:
We seek positive integers n with exactly two digits in base b, say n=xb+y where 1≤x≤b−1, 0≤y≤b−1, and x+y=√n. Setting √n=s gives n=s^2 and x b + y = s^2 with x+y=s. Eliminating y yields x=(s(s−1))/(b−1), which must be an integer ≥1. Let m=b−1. Thus s(s−1)≡0 mod m and s(s−1)≥m.  The number of solutions s mod m of s(s−1)≡0 mod m is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω(m) is the number of distinct primes dividing m. Among these, s=1 is invalid (x=0), so the count of b-eautiful numbers is 2^{ω(b−1)}−1. We need 2^{ω(b−1)}−1&gt;10 ⇒2^{ω(b−1)}&gt;11 ⇒ω(b−1)≥4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒b=211.

### thinking by Debate Agent QFlx:
We want integers n=qb+r in base b (with q≥1, r≥0, q,r≤b−1) such that q+r=√n and n has exactly two digits in base b (i.e. b≤n≤b²−1). Writing s=q+r gives n=s² and also s²=qb+r=q b+(s−q)=q(b−1)+s, so s(s−1)=q(b−1). For a given base b (so d=b−1), solutions correspond to integers s with  ⌈√b⌉≤s≤d and d|s(s−1).  Equivalently, s(s−1)≡0 mod d means for each prime power dividing d we have s≡0 or 1 mod that prime power.  If d has w distinct prime factors, there are 2^w residue classes mod d, one of which is s≡1 mod d (leading to s=1 which is too small since s²&lt;b), and the rest give one s in [1,d].  To get more than ten solutions we need 2^w−1&gt;10 ⇒2^w&gt;11 ⇒w≥4.  The smallest integer d=b−1 with at least 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=211.  A check shows that apart from s=1, all other 15 residue classes produce s≥15=⌈√211⌉, giving 15 b-eautiful integers, which exceeds ten.  No smaller b has four prime factors in b−1, so the least base is 211.

    <pre>We seek positive integers n that in base b have two digits x,y with x+y=√n. Writing n=s², x b+y=s², x+y=s gives x=(s²−s)/(b−1). Thus s(s−1)≡0 mod (b−1). The number of residue classes mod m=b−1 satisfying s(s−1)≡0 is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω counts distinct prime factors. Excluding the trivial class s≡1 mod m which yields s=1&lt;b^{1/2}, we get at most 2^{ω(b−1)}−1 valid s. We need 2^{ω(b−1)}−1&gt;10→2^{ω(b−1)}&gt;11→ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210→b=211. Checking shows exactly 15 b-eautiful numbers for b=211, exceeding ten, and no smaller b has b−1 with 4 prime factors.
