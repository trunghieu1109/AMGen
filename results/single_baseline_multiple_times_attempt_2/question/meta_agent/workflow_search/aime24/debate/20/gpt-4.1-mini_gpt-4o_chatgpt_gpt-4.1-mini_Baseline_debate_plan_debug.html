    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent zb7h:
To find the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and these two digits sum to the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as ab + c, where a and c are the digits and 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b. The sum of the digits is a + c, and we need a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = (a + c)^2. The number n should also be a two-digit number in base b, meaning b &lt;= ab + c &lt; b^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten values of a and c satisfying these conditions. We will try different values of b starting from b=2 and check the number of valid (a, c) pairs.

To find the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to explore the structure of these integers. A b-beautiful integer n in base b has two digits, which we can denote as (a, c)_b, where a and c are the digits. The value of n in base 10 is a*b + c. The condition given is that a + c = sqrt(n). For n to be a perfect square, let&#39;s denote n = k^2, where k is an integer. Thus, a + c = k, and n = a*b + c = k^2. So, we need to find the number of solutions (a, c) such that a + c = k and a*b + c = k^2. We can express c = k - a. Substituting this in the equation a*b + c = k^2, we get a*b + (k - a) = k^2, which simplifies to a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k. Therefore, a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1). For a to be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten solutions for a and c. Let&#39;s calculate for small values of b.

    <pre>To determine the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and these two digits sum to the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as ab + c, where a and c are the digits and 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b. The sum of the digits is a + c, and we need a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = (a + c)^2. The number n should also be a two-digit number in base b, meaning b &lt;= ab + c &lt; b^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten values of a and c satisfying these conditions. By testing small values of b, we find that for b = 5, there are 11 solutions, which is more than ten. For b = 4, there are only 6 solutions, and for b = 3, there are only 3 solutions. Therefore, the smallest b is 5.
