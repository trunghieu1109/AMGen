Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek positive integers n that in base b have two digits x,y with x+y=√n. Writing n=s², x b+y=s², x+y=s gives x=(s²−s)/(b−1). Thus s(s−1)≡0 mod (b−1). The number of residue classes mod m=b−1 satisfying s(s−1)≡0 is 2^{ω(m)}, where ω counts distinct prime factors. Excluding the trivial class s≡1 mod m which yields s=1<b^{1/2}, we get at most 2^{ω(b−1)}−1 valid s. We need 2^{ω(b−1)}−1>10→2^{ω(b−1)}>11→ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210→b=211. Checking shows exactly 15 b-eautiful numbers for b=211, exceeding ten, and no smaller b has b−1 with 4 prime factors.
