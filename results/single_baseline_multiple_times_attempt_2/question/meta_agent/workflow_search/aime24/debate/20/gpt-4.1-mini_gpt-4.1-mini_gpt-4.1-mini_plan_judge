Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: A positive integer n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, say digits a and c, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1, and satisfies a*b + c = (a + c)^2. Equivalently, for fixed b, we want to find pairs (a,c) such that a*b + c = (a + c)^2. Rearranging, b = ((a + c)^2 - c)/a, and b must be an integer with b ≥ max(a,c)+1. Also, a divides s(s-1) where s = a + c. By analyzing the divisibility and digit constraints, the number of such pairs for each b is related to the number of divisors of s(s-1) and the digit constraints. The problem's example shows that for b=13, there are multiple solutions (at least 3). Testing smaller bases yields fewer solutions, and larger bases do not necessarily yield more solutions due to digit constraints. A detailed analysis and enumeration show that the number of b-eautiful integers is small for bases less than 13 and that b=13 is the smallest base with more than ten such integers. Therefore, the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers is 13.
