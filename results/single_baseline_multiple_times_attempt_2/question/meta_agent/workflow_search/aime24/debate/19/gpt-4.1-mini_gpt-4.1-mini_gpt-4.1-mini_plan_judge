Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are asked to find the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \neq 1 \) is a 13th root of unity. First, rewrite the term inside the product as \( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \). The product over all 13th roots of unity \( \omega^k \) (including 1) of \( P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 2 \) is the resultant of \( Q(x) = x^{13} - 1 \) and \( P(x) \). The resultant equals the product of \( Q(\beta) \) over roots \( \beta \) of \( P(x) \). The roots of \( P(x) \) are \( 1 \pm i \). Evaluating \( Q(1+i) = (1+i)^{13} - 1 \) and \( Q(1 - i) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \) using polar form and simplification yields \( Q(1+i) = -65 - 64i \) and \( Q(1 - i) = -65 + 64i \). Their product is \( (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \). Thus, the product is 8321. Taking modulo 1000, the remainder is \( 8321 \mod 1000 = 321 \).
