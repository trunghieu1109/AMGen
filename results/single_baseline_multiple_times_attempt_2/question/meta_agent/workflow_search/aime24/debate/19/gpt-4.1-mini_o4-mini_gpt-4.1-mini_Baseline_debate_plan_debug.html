    <pre>Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

### thinking by Debate Agent Vl8w:
We need ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity.  Let f(x)=x^2−2x+2.  Then the product is ∏_{roots α of x^13−1} f(α)=Res(x^13−1,f(x)).  Since x^13−1 is monic, this resultant equals ∏_{f(β)=0}(β^13−1).  The roots of f(x)=0 are β=1±i.  Compute β1=1+i=√2 e^{iπ/4}, so β1^13=(√2)^13 e^{i(13π/4)}=2^6√2 e^{i(3π+π/4)}=64√2⋅(−(√2/2+ i√2/2))=−64(1+i).  Hence β1^13−1=−65−64i.  Its conjugate β2 gives β2^13−1=−65+64i.  The product is (−65−64i)(−65+64i)=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321.  Therefore the original product is 8321, and mod 1000 this is 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZnSC:
We want P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}), where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity.  Note 2−2x+x^2=x^2−2x+2=f(x).  Then P=∏_{ξ^13=1}f(ξ)=Res(x^13−1,f(x)).  Since f is monic of degree 2, this resultant equals ∏_{β: f(β)=0}(β^13−1).  The roots of f are β=1±i, so we compute (1+i)^13−1 and (1−i)^13−1.  Write 1+i=√2·cis(π/4) ⇒(1+i)^13=(√2)^13·cis(13π/4)=64√2·cis(5π/4)=−64−64i, so (1+i)^13−1=−65−64i.  Similarly (1−i)^13−1=−65+64i.  Their product is (−65)^2+(64)^2=4225+4096=8321.  Thus P=8321 and 8321 mod 1000=321.
