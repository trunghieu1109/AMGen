Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) over the 13th roots of unity ω. Note 2−2x+x^2=x^2−2x+2=f(x). Then P=∏_{ξ^13=1}f(ξ)=Res(x^13−1,f(x)). Since f is monic of degree 2, this resultant equals ∏_{β: f(β)=0}(β^13−1). The roots of f are β=1±i. Compute (1+i)^13=(√2)^13·cis(13π/4)=64√2·cis(5π/4)=−64−64i, so (1+i)^13−1=−65−64i. Its conjugate gives −65+64i. Their product is (−65)^2+(64)^2=4225+4096=8321. Thus P=8321 and P mod 1000=321.
