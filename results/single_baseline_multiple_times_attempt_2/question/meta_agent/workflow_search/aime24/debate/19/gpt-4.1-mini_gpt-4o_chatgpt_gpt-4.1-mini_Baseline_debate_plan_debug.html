    <pre>Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

### thinking by Debate Agent aieH:
The given product involves 13th roots of unity. These roots satisfy the polynomial x^13 - 1 = 0. The roots are 1, \omega, \omega^2, ..., \omega^{12}. Since \omega \neq 1, \omega is a primitive 13th root of unity. We need to express the product \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) in a simpler form. Note that the expression inside the product can be rewritten using the identity \omega^k = e^{2\pi i k / 13}. After simplification, the expression becomes \prod_{k=0}^{12}(1 - \omega^k)^2. This is related to the cyclotomic polynomial for the 13th roots of unity, \Phi_{13}(x). The cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_{13}(x) is given by \prod_{k=0}^{12}(x - \omega^k) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Evaluating this at x = 1 gives \Phi_{13}(1) = 13. To find the product, we need to evaluate \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}((1 - \omega^k)^2) = (\Phi_{13}(1))^2 = 13^2 = 169. Finally, we find the remainder of 169 when divided by 1000.

### thinking by Debate Agent df5Y:
We are given a product involving the 13th roots of unity, and we need to find its remainder when divided by 1000. The expression for each term is $2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}$. We know that $\omega^k$ are the 13th roots of unity, satisfying $\omega^{13} = 1$. Therefore, $\omega^{2k}$ are also 13th roots of unity, specifically $\omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2$. The product is over all 13th roots of unity except 1. Since $\omega^k$ are roots of the polynomial $x^{13} - 1 = 0$, the product of all roots of unity (including 1) is the constant term of the polynomial $x^{13} - 1$, which is 1. However, we exclude the root 1 in our product, so we are effectively evaluating the product of all nontrivial roots. We also observe that $2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}$ can be rewritten as $1 + (1 - \omega^k)^2$. Each term can be interpreted as a modification of the expression $1 - \omega^k$. The product of all these terms should be evaluated carefully, considering symmetry and simplifications due to the properties of roots of unity. Once simplified, we can compute the product modulo 1000.

    <pre>The problem involves evaluating a product over the 13th roots of unity, excluding 1. The expression inside the product is 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}, which can be rewritten as (1 - \omega^k)^2. The product \prod_{k=0}^{12}(1 - \omega^k) is related to the cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_{13}(x), which is x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Evaluating this at x = 1 gives \Phi_{13}(1) = 13. Therefore, the product \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}((1 - \omega^k)^2) = (\Phi_{13}(1))^2 = 13^2 = 169. The remainder of 169 when divided by 1000 is 169. The correct answer is 169.
