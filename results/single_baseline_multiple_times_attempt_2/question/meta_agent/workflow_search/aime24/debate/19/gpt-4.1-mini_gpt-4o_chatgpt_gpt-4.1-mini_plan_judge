Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves evaluating a product over the 13th roots of unity, excluding 1. The expression inside the product is 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}, which can be rewritten as (1 - \omega^k)^2. The product \prod_{k=0}^{12}(1 - \omega^k) is related to the cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_{13}(x), which is x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Evaluating this at x = 1 gives \Phi_{13}(1) = 13. Therefore, the product \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}((1 - \omega^k)^2) = (\Phi_{13}(1))^2 = 13^2 = 169. The remainder of 169 when divided by 1000 is 169. The correct answer is 169.
