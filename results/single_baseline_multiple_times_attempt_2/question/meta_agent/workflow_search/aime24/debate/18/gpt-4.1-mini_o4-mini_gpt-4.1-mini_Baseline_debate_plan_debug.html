    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

### thinking by Debate Agent GEX3:
We look at the family of unit‐length segments joining P=(s,0) to Q=(0,√(1−s²)) in the first quadrant. These segments have equation x/s + y/√(1−s²)=1.  The segment AB corresponds to s=1/2 (so θ=π/3).  A point C on AB can be parameterized by u∈[0,1]:
C(u)=((1−u)/2, u√3/2).  We require that the equation x/s + y/√(1−s²)=1 has the unique solution s=1/2.  Equivalently, in θ‐terms, the function g(θ)=(1−u)/(2cosθ)+(u√3)/(2sinθ) should satisfy g(π/3)=1 and g′(π/3)=0, giving u=3/4.  Hence C=(1/8, 3√3/8) and OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.

### thinking by Debate Agent bh2a:
We have O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), B=(0,√3/2). The family F consists of unit‐length segments PQ with P=(a,0), Q=(0,b), a^2+b^2=1. A point C on AB with parameter s (from A to B) is C=((1−s)/2, s√3/2). C lies on a segment PQ iff there exists λ∈[0,1] with (1−λ)a=(1−s)/2 and λb=s√3/2, a^2+b^2=1. Eliminating a,b gives the quartic equation P(λ)=0. Since λ=s corresponds to segment AB, we require that λ=s is a double root to avoid any other PQ passing through C. Thus P(s)=0 automatically, and P′(s)=0 gives s=3/4. Hence C=(1/8,3√3/8) and OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16. Therefore p+q=7+16=23.

    <pre>We parametrize points P=(a,0), Q=(0,b) with a^2+b^2=1 so each PQ is a unit segment. AB corresponds to the case a=1/2,b=√3/2. A generic point on AB is C(u)=((1−u)/2, u√3/2). Requiring C(u) lie on another segment PQ leads to a system which forces u=3/4 to make the AB‐segment the only one through C. Then C=(1/8,3√3/8) and OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
