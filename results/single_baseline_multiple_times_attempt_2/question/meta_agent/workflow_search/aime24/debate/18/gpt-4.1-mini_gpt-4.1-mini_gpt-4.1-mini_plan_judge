Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The problem involves finding a unique point C on segment AB such that C does not lie on any other unit segment PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant, except for AB itself. Parameterizing AB and analyzing the condition for C to lie on such a segment leads to an equation involving t, the parameter along AB. By considering the function f(x) that determines whether C lies on a segment PQ and requiring that the root at x=1/2 (corresponding to point A) is a double root, we find the condition f'(1/2) = 0. Solving this yields t = 3/4. Substituting back, the coordinates of C are (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8), and the squared distance from O is OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + ((3 sqrt(3))/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Thus, p = 7 and q = 16, and p + q = 23.
