Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Both agents correctly identified the relationship between the circumradius (R), inradius (r), and the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) using the formula OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. They calculated OI^2 = 13, which is consistent with the given condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. However, when it comes to finding AB * AC, the correct approach is to use the formula AB * AC = 2Rr, which directly gives the product of the sides in terms of the circumradius and inradius. Substituting the given values, AB * AC = 2 * 13 * 6 = 156. Therefore, the correct answer is 156.
