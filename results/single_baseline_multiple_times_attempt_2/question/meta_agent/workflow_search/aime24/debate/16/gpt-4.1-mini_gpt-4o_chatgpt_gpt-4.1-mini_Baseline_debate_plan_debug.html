    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking by Debate Agent tF16:
Given the conditions of the problem, we can use the known relationship between the inradius (r), circumradius (R), and the sides of the triangle. One such relationship is Euler&#39;s formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. Substituting the given values, R = 13 and r = 6, we find OI^2 = 13^2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle AIO is a right triangle with AI = r = 6, OI = sqrt(13), and AO = R = 13. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle AIO, AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2, we verify: 6^2 + sqrt(13)^2 = 13^2, which holds true. With these conditions, we deduce that the triangle is isosceles with AB = AC. Using the formula for the area of a triangle, A = rs = 6s, where s is the semiperimeter. The area can also be expressed using the circumradius: A = (abc)/(4R). Equating the two expressions for the area, we have 6s = (abc)/(4*13). Since AB = AC, let AB = AC = x, and BC = a. The semiperimeter s = (x + x + a)/2 = (2x + a)/2. Substituting into the area equation: 6((2x + a)/2) = (x*x*a)/(4*13). Simplifying, we solve for x^2*a = 312x + 156a. Additionally, using the fact that the triangle is isosceles and the conditions given, we can solve for x in terms of the known radii and substitute to find AB * AC.

Given the conditions of the problem, we can use the relationship between the circumradius (R), the inradius (r), and the distance between the incenter (I) and the circumcenter (O). We have the formula: OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. Given R = 13 and r = 6, we substitute to find OI^2 = 13^2 - 2(13)(6). Calculating, OI^2 = 169 - 156 = 13. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, we can use the formula: IA^2 = R^2 - 2Rr + r^2. However, we are asked to find AB * AC, which can be solved using the formula: AB * AC = c^2 - (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/2. We can use the known formula for the product of sides in terms of the inradius and circumradius: AB * AC = 2Rr. Substituting the given values, AB * AC = 2(13)(6).

    <pre>Both agents correctly identified the relationship between the circumradius (R), inradius (r), and the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) using the formula OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. They calculated OI^2 = 13, which is consistent with the given condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. However, when it comes to finding AB * AC, the correct approach is to use the formula AB * AC = 2Rr, which directly gives the product of the sides in terms of the circumradius and inradius. Substituting the given values, AB * AC = 2 * 13 * 6 = 156. Therefore, the correct answer is 156.
