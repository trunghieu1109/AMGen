Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let the dimensions be x, y, z. The constraints are: xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23. The smallest sphere containing the box must have radius at least half the space diagonal d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We want to minimize r^2 = d^2 / 4. Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we get x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Minimizing d^2 is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2. Using Lagrange multipliers and symmetry, assume x = y = a, z = b. The constraints become a^2 + 2ab = 27 and a^2 b = 23. From the second, b = 23 / a^2. Substitute into the first: a^2 + 2a * (23 / a^2) = 27 => a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0. Testing roots, a = 2 satisfies the cubic. Then b = 23 / 4 = 5.75. Compute d^2 = 2a^2 + b^2 = 2*4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16. Then r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. Since 657 and 64 are coprime, p = 657, q = 64, so p + q = 721.
