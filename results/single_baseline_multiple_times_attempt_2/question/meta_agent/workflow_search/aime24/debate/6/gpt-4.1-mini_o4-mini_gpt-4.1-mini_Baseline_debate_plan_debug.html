    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent CyMo:
We seek the box in B (rectangular boxes with surface area S=54 and volume V=23) whose space‐diagonal is largest, since the containing sphere must have radius r at least half that diagonal, and we then take r to be half the maximum diagonal. 

Let the edges be a,b,c&gt;0. Then:
  S=2(ab+bc+ca)=54  ⇒  ab+bc+ca=27,
  V=abc=23.
The square of the space‐diagonal is D²=a²+b²+c².  Note  a²+b²+c² = (a+b+c)²−2(ab+bc+ca) = s₁² −54, where s₁=a+b+c.  To maximize D² we maximize s₁ subject to the constraints.

By symmetry, extrema occur when two variables are equal.  Set b=c.  Then abc=ab²=23 ⇒ a=23/b², and ab+bc+ca = 2ab + b² =27 ⇒ 2(23/b)+b²=27 ⇒ b³−27b+46=0.  This factors as (b−2)(b²+2b−23)=0; the positive roots are b=2 and b=−1+2√6≈3.90.

Case 1: b=2 ⇒ a=23/4=5.75.  Then
  D² = a²+2b² = (23/4)² + 2·4 = 529/16 + 8 = 657/16.
Case 2 gives a smaller D².

Thus the largest diagonal² is 657/16 and r = (1/2)√D² gives r² = (657/16)/4 =657/64.  In lowest terms p/q=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.

### thinking by Debate Agent wCok:
We need the smallest sphere radius r that can contain any rectangular box with given surface area S=54 and volume V=23. For box with edges x,y,z, sphere radius = half the space diagonal: r=½√(x²+y²+z²). We seek the maximum of √(x²+y²+z²) under constraints xy+yz+zx=27 (since 2(xy+yz+zx)=54) and xyz=23. By symmetry at optimum two edges are equal: let y=z=t, x=u. Then constraints become 2ut+t²=27 and ut²=23. Solve ut²=23 → u=23/t², substitute: 2·(23/t) + t² =27 → t² −27 +46/t=0 → t=2 or t=−1+2√6≈3.898. Both positive but t=2 gives u=23/4=5.75, yielding D²=u²+2t²=5.75²+2·4=33.0625+8=41.0625=657/16 &gt; the other case. Hence maximum D²=657/16, so r²=(D/2)²=(657/16)/4=657/64. Thus p+q=657+64=721.

    <pre>We need the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. For a box with edges a,b,c, sphere radius is half its space diagonal: r = ½√(a²+b²+c²). We maximize √(a²+b²+c²) under constraints ab+bc+ca = 27 and abc = 23. By symmetry, the extremum occurs when two edges are equal, say b=c. Then variables satisfy 2ab + b² = 27 and ab² = 23, leading to b=2, a=23/4. The maximal diagonal squared is a²+2b² = (23/4)² + 2·4 = 657/16. Hence r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64. In lowest terms p/q = 657/64, so p+q = 657 + 64 = 721.
