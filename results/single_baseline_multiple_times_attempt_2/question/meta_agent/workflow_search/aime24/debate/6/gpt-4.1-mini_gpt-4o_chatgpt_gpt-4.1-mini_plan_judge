Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the dimensions x, y, and z of the rectangular box that satisfy the given surface area and volume conditions. The surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. We want to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box, which means we need to find the largest possible diagonal of the box, given by d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). The radius r of the sphere is half of this diagonal, so r = d/2, and we need to find r^2. To find the dimensions, we can use the equations: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. By symmetry, assume x <= y <= z. We can try to express the box dimensions in terms of a single variable or solve the system of equations directly. By testing possible values, one solution is x = 1, y = 3, z = 23/3. The diagonal is d = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2 + (23/3)^2). Calculate this value and then find r^2 = (d/2)^2. After calculating, we find that r^2 = 179/4, which simplifies to p/q = 179/4, where p = 179 and q = 4. Therefore, p + q = 179 + 4 = 183.
