    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent ssZm:
Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, and z. We have two conditions:
1) Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27.
2) Volume: xyz = 23.

We want to find the smallest sphere radius r that can contain the box. The smallest sphere containing the box must have radius at least half the length of the box&#39;s space diagonal, because the sphere must cover the entire box. The space diagonal d is given by d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Thus, r = d/2.

We want to find the minimum possible r over all boxes with the given surface area and volume, i.e., minimize d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 subject to the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Using the identity:
(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx),
we get
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So minimizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2.

Let s = x + y + z.

We know:
xy + yz + zx = 27
xyz = 23

We want to minimize s^2 - 54.

The numbers x, y, z are roots of the cubic equation:
t^3 - s t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0.

By AM-GM inequality:
s = x + y + z ≥ 3 (xyz)^{1/3} = 3 * 23^{1/3}.

Since 23^{1/3} is about 2.8439, s ≥ 3 * 2.8439 ≈ 8.5317.

We check if this s satisfies the other constraints.

We use the identity:
(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)
=&gt; x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54.

We want to minimize s^2 - 54 with s ≥ 8.5317.

We also use the inequality:
(x + y + z)^2 ≥ 3(xy + yz + zx) = 3 * 27 = 81
=&gt; s^2 ≥ 81
=&gt; s ≥ 9.

So s ≥ max(8.5317, 9) = 9.

We check if s=9 is possible with xyz=23.

The cubic equation is:
t^3 - 9 t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0.

We check if this cubic has positive roots.

By the rational root theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±23, ±... but 1 and 23 are not roots.

We can check the discriminant or use Vieta&#39;s relations.

Assuming the roots are positive, then s=9 is possible.

Therefore, the minimal s is 9, so minimal x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9^2 - 54 = 81 - 54 = 27.

Hence, minimal d^2 = 27.

The minimal radius squared r^2 = d^2 / 4 = 27 / 4.

p = 27, q = 4, so p + q = 31.

### thinking by Debate Agent Gz7R:
We are given a set \( \mathcal{B} \) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. We want to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain each box in \( \mathcal{B} \). The radius \( r \) must be at least half the length of the box&#39;s space diagonal because the smallest sphere containing a box must have radius at least half the diagonal of the box.

Let the dimensions of the box be \( x, y, z \). Then:

1. Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \implies xy + yz + zx = 27 \).
2. Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

The space diagonal \( d \) of the box is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \]

We want to minimize the radius \( r \) such that the sphere contains the box, so:
\[ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2} \]

We want to find the minimum possible \( r \) that works for all boxes in \( \mathcal{B} \), so we want the minimum possible \( d \) given the constraints on \( x, y, z \).

Using the given constraints:
- \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \)
- \( xyz = 23 \)

We want to minimize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \).

Recall the identity:
\[ (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \]

So:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54 \]

Therefore, minimizing \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) is equivalent to minimizing \( (x + y + z)^2 \) since 54 is constant.

We want to minimize \( x + y + z \) subject to:
- \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \)
- \( xyz = 23 \)

By the AM-GM inequality and symmetry, the minimum sum occurs when the variables are equal or close. However, since the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, the variables are not all equal.

Let&#39;s denote \( s = x + y + z \).

We have the cubic equation with roots \( x, y, z \):
\[ t^3 - s t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 \]

We want to minimize \( s \).

Since \( x, y, z \) are positive real numbers, the cubic must have positive roots.

We try to find \( s \) such that the cubic has three positive real roots.

Using the discriminant or by trial, we can try to find the minimum \( s \).

Try \( s = 6 \):
\[ t^3 - 6 t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 \]

Evaluate at \( t=1 \):
\[ 1 - 6 + 27 - 23 = -1 \]

At \( t=2 \):
\[ 8 - 24 + 54 - 23 = 15 \]

So root between 1 and 2.

Try \( s = 7 \):
\[ t^3 - 7 t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 \]

At \( t=1 \):
\[ 1 - 7 + 27 - 23 = -2 \]

At \( t=3 \):
\[ 27 - 63 + 81 - 23 = 22 \]

Root between 1 and 3.

Try \( s = 9 \):
\[ t^3 - 9 t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 \]

At \( t=3 \):
\[ 27 - 81 + 81 - 23 = 4 \]

At \( t=2 \):
\[ 8 - 36 + 54 - 23 = 3 \]

No root between 2 and 3.

Try \( s = 8 \):
\[ t^3 - 8 t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 \]

At \( t=2 \):
\[ 8 - 32 + 54 - 23 = 7 \]

At \( t=1 \):
\[ 1 - 8 + 27 - 23 = -3 \]

Root between 1 and 2.

We see the roots exist for these values.

To minimize \( s \), consider the inequality:

By AM-GM:
\[ \frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq (xyz)^{1/3} = 23^{1/3} \approx 2.843 \]

So \( s = x + y + z \geq 3 \times 2.843 = 8.529 \).

So the minimum \( s \approx 8.529 \).

Then:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54 \approx (8.529)^2 - 54 = 72.74 - 54 = 18.74 \]

The diagonal squared is \( d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \approx 18.74 \).

Thus, the radius squared is:
\[ r^2 = \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{d^2}{4} = \frac{18.74}{4} = 4.685 \]

But this is approximate. We need an exact answer.

Let&#39;s try to find \( s \) exactly.

Using the symmetric sums:
\[ x + y + z = s \]
\[ xy + yz + zx = 27 \]
\[ xyz = 23 \]

The polynomial is:
\[ t^3 - s t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 \]

The discriminant of this cubic must be non-negative for three real roots.

The discriminant \( \Delta \) of cubic \( t^3 + a t^2 + b t + c = 0 \) is:
\[ \Delta = 18abc - 4b^3 + b^2 a^2 - 4 a^3 c - 27 c^2 \]

Here, \( a = -s, b = 27, c = -23 \).

Calculate \( \Delta \) in terms of \( s \):

\[
\Delta = 18(-s)(27)(-23) - 4 (27)^3 + (27)^2 (-s)^2 - 4 (-s)^3 (-23) - 27 (-23)^2
\]

Calculate each term:

1. \( 18(-s)(27)(-23) = 18 \times (-s) \times 27 \times (-23) = 18 \times 27 \times 23 \times s = 11178 s \)
2. \( -4 (27)^3 = -4 \times 19683 = -78732 \)
3. \( (27)^2 (-s)^2 = 729 s^2 \)
4. \( -4 (-s)^3 (-23) = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) \)

Wait, simplify carefully:
\[ -4 a^3 c = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) = -4 (-s)^3 (-23) \]

Since \( (-s)^3 = -s^3 \), then:
\[ -4 a^3 c = -4 (-s^3) (-23) = -4 (-s^3)(-23) = -4 s^3 	imes 23 = -92 s^3 \]

5. \( -27 c^2 = -27 (-23)^2 = -27 	imes 529 = -14283 \)

Sum all:
\[ \Delta = 11178 s - 78732 + 729 s^2 - 92 s^3 - 14283 \]

Combine constants:
\[ -78732 - 14283 = -93015 \]

So:
\[ \Delta = -92 s^3 + 729 s^2 + 11178 s - 93015 \]

For three real roots, \( \Delta \geq 0 \).

We want to find the minimal \( s \) such that \( \Delta = 0 \).

Try to find roots of \( \Delta = 0 \).

Try \( s = 9 \):
\[ -92 (729) + 729 (81) + 11178 (9) - 93015 \]
\[ -67188 + 59049 + 100602 - 93015 = (-67188 + 59049) + (100602 - 93015) = (-8139) + 7557 = -582 \]

Negative.

Try \( s = 10 \):
\[ -92 (1000) + 729 (100) + 11178 (10) - 93015 = -92000 + 72900 + 111780 - 93015 \]
\[ (-92000 + 72900) + (111780 - 93015) = (-19100) + 18765 = -335 \]

Still negative.

Try \( s = 11 \):
\[ -92 (1331) + 729 (121) + 11178 (11) - 93015 = -122452 + 88109 + 122958 - 93015 \]
\[ (-122452 + 88109) + (122958 - 93015) = (-34343) + 29943 = -4400 \]

Negative.

Try \( s = 8 \):
\[ -92 (512) + 729 (64) + 11178 (8) - 93015 = -47104 + 46656 + 89424 - 93015 \]
\[ (-47104 + 46656) + (89424 - 93015) = (-448) + (-3591) = -4039 \]

Negative.

Try \( s = 7 \):
\[ -92 (343) + 729 (49) + 11178 (7) - 93015 = -31556 + 35721 + 78246 - 93015 \]
\[ (-31556 + 35721) + (78246 - 93015) = 4165 + (-14769) = -10604 \]

Negative.

Try \( s = 6 \):
\[ -92 (216) + 729 (36) + 11178 (6) - 93015 = -19872 + 26244 + 67068 - 93015 \]
\[ (-19872 + 26244) + (67068 - 93015) = 6372 + (-25947) = -19575 \]

Negative.

Try \( s = 5 \):
\[ -92 (125) + 729 (25) + 11178 (5) - 93015 = -11500 + 18225 + 55890 - 93015 \]
\[ (-11500 + 18225) + (55890 - 93015) = 6725 + (-37125) = -30400 \]

Negative.

Try \( s = 4 \):
\[ -92 (64) + 729 (16) + 11178 (4) - 93015 = -5888 + 11664 + 44712 - 93015 \]
\[ (-5888 + 11664) + (44712 - 93015) = 5776 + (-48303) = -42527 \]

Negative.

\[ (-159936 + 104976) + (134136 - 93015) = (-54960) + 41121 = -13839 \]

Negative.

Negative.

Since the discriminant is negative for all tested values, it seems the cubic does not have three real roots.

This suggests the minimal sum \( s \) is the root of the cubic where two roots coincide (double root), which corresponds to the condition that the discriminant is zero.

Instead, consider using Lagrange multipliers to minimize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) subject to constraints.

Set up Lagrange multipliers:

Minimize:
\[ f = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \]

Subject to:
\[ g = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0 \]
\[ h = xyz - 23 = 0 \]

Form the Lagrangian:
\[ \mathcal{L} = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - \lambda (xy + yz + zx - 27) - \mu (xyz - 23) \]

Take partial derivatives:

\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2x - \lambda (y + z) - \mu (yz) = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 2y - \lambda (x + z) - \mu (xz) = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z} = 2z - \lambda (x + y) - \mu (xy) = 0 \]

By symmetry, assume \( x = y \neq z \) or all equal.

Try \( x = y = a \), \( z = b \).

Then constraints:

\[ a^2 + 2 a b = 27 \]
\[ a^2 b = 23 \]

From second:
\[ b = \frac{23}{a^2} \]

Substitute into first:
\[ a^2 + 2 a \cdot \frac{23}{a^2} = 27 \implies a^2 + \frac{46}{a} = 27 \]

Multiply both sides by \( a \):
\[ a^3 + 46 = 27 a \implies a^3 - 27 a + 46 = 0 \]

Solve cubic for \( a \).

Try rational roots: factors of 46 are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Try \( a = 1 \):
\[ 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 \neq 0 \]

Try \( a = 2 \):
\[ 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 \]

So \( a = 2 \) is a root.

So \( a = 2 \).

Then \( b = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \).

Now compute \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2 a^2 + b^2 = 2 (4) + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 \).

Diagonal squared \( d^2 = 41.0625 \).

Radius squared \( r^2 = \frac{d^2}{4} = \frac{41.0625}{4} = 10.265625 \).

Express as fraction:
\[ 41.0625 = 41 + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{656 + 1}{16} = \frac{657}{16} \]

So:
\[ r^2 = \frac{657}{16} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \]

Since \( 657 = 3 \times 219 = 3 \times 3 \times 73 \), and 64 is \( 2^6 \), they are relatively prime.

Therefore, \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \), and \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

    <pre>We are given a set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let the dimensions be x, y, z. The constraints are: xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23. The smallest sphere containing the box must have radius at least half the space diagonal d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We want to minimize r^2 = d^2 / 4. Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we get x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Minimizing d^2 is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2. Using Lagrange multipliers and symmetry, assume x = y = a, z = b. The constraints become a^2 + 2ab = 27 and a^2 b = 23. From the second, b = 23 / a^2. Substitute into the first: a^2 + 2a * (23 / a^2) = 27 =&gt; a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0. Testing roots, a = 2 satisfies the cubic. Then b = 23 / 4 = 5.75. Compute d^2 = 2a^2 + b^2 = 2*4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16. Then r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. Since 657 and 64 are coprime, p = 657, q = 64, so p + q = 721.
