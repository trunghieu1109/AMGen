Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. For a box with edges a,b,c, sphere radius is half its space diagonal: r = ½√(a²+b²+c²). We maximize √(a²+b²+c²) under constraints ab+bc+ca = 27 and abc = 23. By symmetry, the extremum occurs when two edges are equal, say b=c. Then variables satisfy 2ab + b² = 27 and ab² = 23, leading to b=2, a=23/4. The maximal diagonal squared is a²+2b² = (23/4)² + 2·4 = 657/16. Hence r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64. In lowest terms p/q = 657/64, so p+q = 657 + 64 = 721.
