Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We seek the probability that a random coloring admits a nonzero rotation k (1≤k≤7) with B∩(B+k)=∅.  Equivalently N=number of subsets B⊆Z₈ with ∃k: B and its k‐shift disjoint.  By pigeonhole, any |B|≥5 has no disjoint shift (256−93=163 such B lie in the complement), and any |B|≤3 always has some disjoint shift (93 of them).  For |B|=4, a disjoint shift forces B+k=complement, which occurs only for k=1,3,5,7 (2 patterns), k=2,6 (4 patterns), or k=4 (16 patterns), totaling 22 of the 70 four‐sets.  Hence N=93+22=115 and probability=115/256, so m+n=115+256=371.
