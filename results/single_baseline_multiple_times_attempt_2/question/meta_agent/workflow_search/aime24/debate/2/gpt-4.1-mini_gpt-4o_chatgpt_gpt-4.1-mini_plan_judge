Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly colored octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. Each vertex of the octagon can be colored either red or blue, giving us a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. We need to consider the symmetries of the octagon, which can be rotated by 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees. For a coloring to be rotationally symmetric, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, which is 4 blue and 4 red vertices. The number of such colorings is \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \). However, we need to find the number of colorings that remain valid under rotation. Using Burnside's Lemma, we consider each rotation: the identity rotation (0 degrees) always works, and the 180-degree rotation (4 steps) also works because it maps each vertex to its opposite. For these rotations, we have 2^4 valid colorings (since we choose colors for 4 vertices, and the opposite vertices must be the same color). Thus, there are 2 * 2^4 = 32 successful colorings. The probability is 32/256 = 1/8. Therefore, m+n = 1+8 = 9.
