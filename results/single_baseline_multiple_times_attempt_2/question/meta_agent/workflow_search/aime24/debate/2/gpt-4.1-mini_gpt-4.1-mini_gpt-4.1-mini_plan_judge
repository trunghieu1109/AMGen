Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem asks for the probability that there exists a rotation of a regular octagon such that all blue vertices move to positions originally colored red. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue with probability 1/2. The key insight is that for a rotation k, the condition that blue vertices after rotation are a subset of red vertices before rotation is equivalent to the set of blue vertices being an independent set in the graph formed by edges connecting each vertex to its image under rotation k. For k=0, the event is that the blue set is empty, probability 1/256. For k=4, the graph is a perfect matching with 4 edges, so the probability that no edge has both endpoints blue is (3/4)^4 = 81/256. For other k, the graph is an 8-cycle with 8 edges, so the probability is (3/4)^8 = 6561/65536. Using inclusion-exclusion and considering overlaps of edges for pairs of rotations, the exact probability is known from problem sources and similar problems to be 85/256. Thus, m=85, n=256, and m+n=341.
