    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

### thinking by Debate Agent ziFJ:
We label the 8 vertices cyclically and let B be the set of blue‐colored vertices. A rotation by k positions works iff B and B+k are disjoint. Let A_k be the family of subsets with B∩(B+k)=∅. We want |⋃_{k=1..7}A_k|/2^8. Equivalently, we compute its complement C=⋂_{k=1..7}
{B∩(B+k)≠∅}.  By a simple pigeonhole argument, any B of size ≥5 automatically lies in C (there are 56+28+8+1=93 such subsets).  For size 4 we must avoid the four critical shifts k=1,2,3,4.  Inclusion–exclusion on these four events among the C(8,4)=70 subsets shows exactly 51 of them also lie in C.  Hence |C|=93+51=144, so |⋃A_k|=256−144=112, and the desired probability is 112/256=7/16.  Thus m+n=7+16=23.

### thinking by Debate Agent WDCQ:
We want the probability that a random 2‐coloring of the 8 vertices admits a rotation sending blue vertices into red ones, i.e. there is k (0≤k&lt;8) with B∩(B+k)=∅.  One checks that any blue‐set B of size ≤3 is always good, any of size ≥5 is always bad, and among size‐4 subsets exactly those whose 4 gaps (around the circle) are the multiset {1,1,2,4} fail.  There are C(8,0)+C(8,1)+C(8,2)+C(8,3)=93 good of sizes ≤3, plus 70−24=46 good of size 4, for a total of 139 good out of 256.  Hence the probability is 139/256, so m+n=395.

    <pre>We seek the probability that a random coloring admits a nonzero rotation k (1≤k≤7) with B∩(B+k)=∅.  Equivalently N=number of subsets B⊆Z₈ with ∃k: B and its k‐shift disjoint.  By pigeonhole, any |B|≥5 has no disjoint shift (256−93=163 such B lie in the complement), and any |B|≤3 always has some disjoint shift (93 of them).  For |B|=4, a disjoint shift forces B+k=complement, which occurs only for k=1,3,5,7 (2 patterns), k=2,6 (4 patterns), or k=4 (16 patterns), totaling 22 of the 70 four‐sets.  Hence N=93+22=115 and probability=115/256, so m+n=115+256=371.
