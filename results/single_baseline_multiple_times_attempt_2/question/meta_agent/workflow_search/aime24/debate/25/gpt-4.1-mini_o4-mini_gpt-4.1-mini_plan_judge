Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, there is a well‐known reciprocal sum relation between the common side length s and the side lengths a,b,c of the triangle formed by the three alternating side‐lines: 1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.  Here a=200, b=240, c=300, so 1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300 = 0.005 + 0.004166… + 0.003333… = 0.0125, giving s = 1/0.0125 = 80.

Answer:80
