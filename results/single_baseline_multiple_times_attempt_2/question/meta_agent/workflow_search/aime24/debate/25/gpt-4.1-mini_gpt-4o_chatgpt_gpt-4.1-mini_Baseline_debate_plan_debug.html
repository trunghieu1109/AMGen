    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent v202:
We are given a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with sides 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are of equal length, say x. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is actually the triangle formed by the diagonals of the hexagon. In this configuration, the side lengths of the triangle correspond to the differences between the lengths of the diagonals. If we denote the diagonals of the hexagon as d1, d2, and d3, then the sides of the triangle are |d1 - d2|, |d2 - d3|, and |d3 - d1|. Given the lengths of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, we can assign these to |d1 - d2| = 200, |d2 - d3| = 240, and |d3 - d1| = 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, it can be inscribed in a circle, and the diagonals are equal, meaning d1 = d2 = d3. Using this information, the side length of the hexagon can be determined. By the properties of equilateral hexagons, the side length x is equal to the semiperimeter of the triangle formed by the diagonals divided by 3. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is (200 + 240 + 300) / 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0kwN:
To find the side length of the hexagon, we need to understand the relationship between the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Since ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it is a special type of hexagon known as a &#39;parallelogramic&#39; or &#39;affine regular&#39; hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is similar to the hexagon, and the side lengths of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. The key to solving this problem is realizing that the side length of the hexagon is proportional to these side lengths due to the similarity. The perimeter of the triangle is 200 + 240 + 300 = 740. In a regular hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel, each side of the hexagon is equal to one-third of the perimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides.

    <pre>The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with sides 200, 240, and 300. The key insight is that the hexagon is a special type known as an affine regular hexagon, where the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides is similar to the hexagon. The perimeter of the triangle is 200 + 240 + 300 = 740. In such a hexagon, each side is equal to one-third of the perimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 740 / 3.
