Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with sides 200, 240, and 300. The key insight is that the hexagon is a special type known as an affine regular hexagon, where the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides is similar to the hexagon. The perimeter of the triangle is 200 + 240 + 300 = 740. In such a hexagon, each side is equal to one-third of the perimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 740 / 3.
