    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent R0We:
We note that an equilateral convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel can be realized as the intersection of three pairs of parallel strips of widths 2p1,2p2,2p3 in directions 0°,120°,240°.  Its side length s comes out to satisfy the reciprocal‐sum relation

   1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c,

where a,b,c are the side‐lengths of the triangle formed by the lines of three alternating sides (here 200,240,300).  Indeed

   1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300 = (0.005 + 0.0041667 + 0.0033333) = 0.0125
   ⇒ s = 1/0.0125 = 80.


### thinking by Debate Agent nJac:
We model the hexagon by vectors u, v, w with equal length s and opposite sides parallel.  Writing v=μu+νw and working out the intersections of lines AB, CD, and EF leads to triangle side‐length formulas a=s|1−α+α/β|, b=s|1−β+β/α|, c=s|1−1/α−1/β| with α=−μ&gt;0, β=−ν&gt;0.  Solving these for a=200, b=300, c=240 gives α=5/6, β=5/4 and hence s=240.

### answer by Debate Agent R0We:
80

### answer by Debate Agent nJac:
240

    <pre>In an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, there is a well‐known reciprocal sum relation between the common side length s and the side lengths a,b,c of the triangle formed by the three alternating side‐lines: 1/s = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.  Here a=200, b=240, c=300, so 1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300 = 0.005 + 0.004166… + 0.003333… = 0.0125, giving s = 1/0.0125 = 80.
