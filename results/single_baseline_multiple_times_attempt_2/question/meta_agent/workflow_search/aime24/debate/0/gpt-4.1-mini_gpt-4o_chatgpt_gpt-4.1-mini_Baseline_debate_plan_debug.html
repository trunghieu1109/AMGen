    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent dMAu:
Let&#39;s first determine Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. When Aya walks at speed s, the walking time is 4 hours minus the time spent in the coffee shop, t minutes. Since the walk is 9 kilometers, we have 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at s+2 km/h, the time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) minus t minutes in the coffee shop, so 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. We have two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Solving these equations will give us s and t. Subtract the second equation from the first: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Simplifying gives 9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6s(s+2). This simplifies to 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s. Solving this quadratic equation for s gives s = 3. Plugging s = 3 back into the first equation gives t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s + 0.5 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. This is 2.571 hours, which is approximately 2 hours and 34.3 minutes. Including the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 2 hours and 34.3 minutes plus 60 minutes, which is approximately 3 hours and 34.3 minutes. Converting to minutes, the total time is 214.3 minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.

### thinking by Debate Agent aOWj:
First, we need to determine the time Aya spends walking without the coffee shop stop. When she walks at speed s, her walking time is 9/s hours. Given that her total time including the coffee shop is 4 hours, the time spent in the coffee shop is t = 4 - 9/s hours. When she walks at speed s+2, her walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. Given that her total time including the coffee shop is 2 hours and 24 minutes (or 2.4 hours), the time spent in the coffee shop is t = 2.4 - 9/(s+2) hours. We set the two expressions for t equal to each other: 4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s+2). Solving this equation for s, we find that s = 3 km/h. Now, if Aya walks at s + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, her walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Converting this time to minutes and adding the coffee shop time t, we get the total time in minutes.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. We have two scenarios: 1) Aya walks at speed s and the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. 2) Aya walks at speed s+2 and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. We set up the equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving this equation, we find s = 3 km/h. Substituting s = 3 into the first equation gives t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s + 0.5 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours, which is approximately 2.571 hours or 154.3 minutes. Including the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 154.3 + 60 = 214.3 minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.
