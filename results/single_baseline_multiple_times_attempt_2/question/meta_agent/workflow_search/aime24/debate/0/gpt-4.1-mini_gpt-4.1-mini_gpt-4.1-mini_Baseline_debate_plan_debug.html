    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent Qf2j:
Let s be the walking speed in km/h and t the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total time for the walk and coffee is given in hours, so convert t minutes to hours as t/60.

From the problem:
1) At speed s, total time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time
   Walking time = 9/s hours
   So, 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) At speed s+2, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours
   Walking time = 9/(s+2) hours
   So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

From these two equations:
9/s + t/60 = 4  (1)
9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4  (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6

Simplify the left side:
9[(s+2) - s] / [s(s+2)] = 1.6
9 * 2 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6
18 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6

So, s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25

This gives the quadratic:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve for s:
Using quadratic formula:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4*11.25)] / 2
= [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2
= [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2
= [-2 ± 7] / 2

Two solutions:
s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h (valid speed)
s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (not valid)

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Find t from equation (1):
9/s + t/60 = 4
9/2.5 + t/60 = 4
3.6 + t/60 = 4
t/60 = 0.4
t = 24 minutes

Now, we want the total time when speed is s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h
Walking time = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours
Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours + 0.4 hours = 3.4 hours
Convert to minutes: 3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes

Answer: 204 minutes

### thinking by Debate Agent QqQ3:
Let&#39;s denote the walking speed as s km/h and the time spent in the coffee shop as t minutes. The total time for the walk plus coffee break is given. First, convert all times to hours for consistency.

1. When walking at speed s km/h:
   - Total time = 4 hours
   - Time spent walking = 9/s hours
   - Time spent in coffee shop = t minutes = t/60 hours
   So, 9/s + t/60 = 4

2. When walking at speed (s + 2) km/h:
   - Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours
   - Time spent walking = 9/(s + 2) hours
   - Time spent in coffee shop = t/60 hours
   So, 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

From the first equation:
   t/60 = 4 - 9/s
From the second equation:
   t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Set them equal:
   4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Simplify:
   4 - 2.4 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)
   1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Find common denominator:
   1.6 = 9((s + 2) - s) / (s(s + 2))
   1.6 = 9 * 2 / (s^2 + 2s)
   1.6 = 18 / (s^2 + 2s)

Rearranged:
   s^2 + 2s = 18 / 1.6
   s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Form quadratic equation:
   s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve for s using quadratic formula:
   s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2
   s = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2
   s = [-2 ± 7] / 2

Two solutions:
   s = (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h (positive speed)
   s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 km/h (not valid)

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Find t:
   From first equation:
   t/60 = 4 - 9/s = 4 - 9/2.5 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours
   t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

Now, find the total time when walking at speed s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h:
   Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours
   Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours + 0.4 hours = 3.4 hours

Convert total time to minutes:
   3.4 hours * 60 = 204 minutes

    <pre>We are given two scenarios with walking speeds s and s+2 km/h, and total times including a coffee break of t minutes. By setting up equations for total time in hours and eliminating t, we find a quadratic equation for s. Solving it gives s = 2.5 km/h. Using this, we find t = 24 minutes. Finally, for speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours, and total time including coffee break is 3 hours + 24 minutes = 204 minutes.
