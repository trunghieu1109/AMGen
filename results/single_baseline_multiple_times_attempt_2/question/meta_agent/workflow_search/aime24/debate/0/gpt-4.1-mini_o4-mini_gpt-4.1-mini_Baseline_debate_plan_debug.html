    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent HHtw:
Let d=9 km. At speed s, walking time is d/s hours, plus t minutes in coffee shop (t/60 hours) gives total 4 hours: 9/s + t/60 = 4. At speed s+2, total is 2h24m = 2.4h: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6 → 9[(s+2)-s]/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 → 18 = 1.6 s(s+2) → s^2+2s-11.25=0 → s = 2.5 km/h. Then 9/2.5 = 3.6h, so t/60 = 0.4h → t = 24 min. Now at speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3h = 180 min, plus 24 min coffee = 204 min.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0rtz:
Let s be her walking speed (km/h) and t the coffee‐shop time in minutes.  The total time is walking plus t/60 hours.

Case 1: speed s, walk time = 9/s, so 9/s + t/60 = 4.
Case 2: speed s+2, walk time = 9/(s+2), so 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 (2 h 24 min = 2.4 h).
Subtracting: 9/s − 9/(s+2) = 1.6 ⇒ 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 ⇒ s(s+2) = 11.25 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h.
Then 9/2.5 = 3.6 h, so t/60 = 4 − 3.6 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 min.
For speed s+0.5 = 3.0 km/h, walk time = 9/3 = 3 h = 180 min. Plus t = 24 min gives 204 min.

    <pre>Let s be her walking speed (km/h) and t the coffee time in minutes. Total time: walking distance 9 km divided by speed plus t/60 hours. At speed s: 9/s + t/60 = 4. At speed s+2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6 → 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 → s(s+2)=11.25 → s=2.5 km/h. Then 9/2.5=3.6 h implies t/60=0.4 → t=24 min. At speed s+0.5=3 km/h, walk time=9/3=3 h=180 min; plus 24 min coffee gives 204 min.
