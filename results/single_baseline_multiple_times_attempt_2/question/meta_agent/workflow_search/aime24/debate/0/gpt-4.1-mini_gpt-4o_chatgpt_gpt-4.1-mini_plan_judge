Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Aya's walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. We have two scenarios: 1) Aya walks at speed s and the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. 2) Aya walks at speed s+2 and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. We set up the equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving this equation, we find s = 3 km/h. Substituting s = 3 into the first equation gives t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s + 0.5 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours, which is approximately 2.571 hours or 154.3 minutes. Including the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 154.3 + 60 = 214.3 minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.
