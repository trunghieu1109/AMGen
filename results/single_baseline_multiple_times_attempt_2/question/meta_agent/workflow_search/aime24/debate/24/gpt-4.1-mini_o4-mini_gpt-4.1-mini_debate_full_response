Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: debate

Solve: from (1) a=1/2+b+c. Substitute into (2) to get c=−5/12. Then b=−3/8 and a=−7/24. We need L=4a+3b+2c=−25/8, so |L|=25/8. Then m+n=25+8=33.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2YiO:\nWe set a=log2 x, b=log2 y, c=log2 z. Then the equations become:\n(1) a - b - c = 1/2\n(2) -a + b - c = 1/3\n(3) -a - b + c = 1/4\nSum gives -(a+b+c)=13/12 so a+b+c=-13/12. Adding (1)+(2) gives -2c=5/6 so c=-5/12. Adding (1)+(3) gives -2b=3/4 so b=-3/8. Adding (2)+(3) gives -2a=7/12 so a=-7/24. Then log2(x^4y^3z^2)=4a+3b+2c=(-28-27-20)/24=-75/24=-25/8, whose absolute value is 25/8. Hence m+n=25+8=33.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent d0HE:\n33\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2YiO:\n33\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
