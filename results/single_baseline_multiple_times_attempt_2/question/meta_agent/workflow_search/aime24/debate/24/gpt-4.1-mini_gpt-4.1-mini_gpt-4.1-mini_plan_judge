Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given the system of logarithmic equations:
log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2,
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3,
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4.

Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). Then the system becomes:
a - b - c = 1/2,
b - a - c = 1/3,
c - a - b = 1/4.

Adding all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Simplifies to:
-a - b - c = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12.

From the system, adding (1) and (2):
-2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12.
Adding (1) and (3):
-2b = 3/4 => b = -3/8.
Adding (2) and (3):
-2a = 7/12 => a = -7/24.

Check sum: a + b + c = -7/24 - 3/8 - 5/12 = -13/12 correct.

We want |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|.
Calculate:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12) = -28/24 - 9/8 - 10/12.
Convert to common denominator 24:
-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8.
Absolute value is 25/8.

Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, m=25, n=8, so m+n=33.
