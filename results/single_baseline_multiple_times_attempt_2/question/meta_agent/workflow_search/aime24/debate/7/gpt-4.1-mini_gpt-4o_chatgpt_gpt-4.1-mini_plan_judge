Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have two equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Converting these to exponential form, we get \( y^x = x^{10} \) and \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). From \( y^x = x^{10} \), we can express \( y = x^{10/x} \). Substituting this into the second equation, we have \( x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10} \). Simplifying both sides gives \( x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x} \). Equating the exponents, \( 4x^{10/x} = 100/x \). Solving for \( x \), we find \( x^{10/x} = 25/x \). Let \( x = 25^{1/10} \), then \( y = (25^{1/10})^{10/25^{1/10}} = 25^{1/10} \). Thus, \( xy = 25^{1/10} \times 25^{1/10} = 25^{2/10} = 25^{1/5} = 5 \). Therefore, the correct value of \( xy \) is 5.
