Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations with bases x and y, both greater than 1: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. From the first, y^x = x^{10}. From the second, x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logs and setting a = ln x, b = ln y, we get two equations: b x = 10 a and 4 y a = 10 b. Expressing y in terms of x and substituting back, we find y = 25 / x. Therefore, the product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25. This satisfies the given equations and conditions, so the answer is 25.
