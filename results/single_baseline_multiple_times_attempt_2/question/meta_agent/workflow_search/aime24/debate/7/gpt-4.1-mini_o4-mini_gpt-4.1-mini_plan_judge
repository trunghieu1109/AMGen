Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have log_x(y^x) = x·(ln y/ln x) = 10 ⇒ x ln y = 10 ln x. Also log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y·(ln x/ln y) = 10 ⇒ 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Multiplying these gives 4xy (ln x)(ln y) = 100 (ln x)(ln y). Since ln x, ln y > 0, divide both sides by (ln x)(ln y) to get 4xy = 100 ⇒ xy = 25.
