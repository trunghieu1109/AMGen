    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking by Debate Agent qFpy:
We are given two equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We start with the first equation: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This implies \( y^x = x^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get \( x \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(x) \). Dividing both sides by \( x \log_{10}(x) \), we have \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \). Now considering the second equation \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we have \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides gives \( 4y \log_{10}(x) = 10 \log_{10}(y) \). Dividing both sides by \( 4y \log_{10}(y) \), we obtain \( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \). Now we have two expressions: \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \) and \( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \). Substituting the second expression into the first gives \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \cdot \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \), leading to \( 1 = \frac{100}{4xy} \). Solving for \( xy \), we find \( xy = 25 \).

### thinking by Debate Agent UHTD:
Given the equations \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we can convert these into exponential form. For the first equation, \( y^x = x^{10} \). For the second equation, \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). We want to find the value of \( xy \). From \( y^x = x^{10} \), we have \( y = x^{10/x} \). Substituting this into the second equation, \( x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10} \). Simplifying both sides gives \( x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x} \). Equating the exponents, \( 4x^{10/x} = 100/x \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x^{10/x} = 25/x \). Let \( x = 25^{1/10} \), then \( y = (25^{1/10})^{10/25^{1/10}} = 25^{1/10} \). Thus, \( xy = 25^{1/10} \times 25^{1/10} = 25^{2/10} = 25^{1/5} = 5 \).
