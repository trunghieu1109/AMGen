    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking by Debate Agent GVAo:
We are given two equations involving logarithms with bases x and y, both greater than 1:

1) \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \)
2) \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \)

From the first equation:
\[ \log_x(y^x) = 10 \implies y^x = x^{10} \]

From the second equation:
\[ \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \implies x^{4y} = y^{10} \]

Rewrite the first equation:
\[ y^x = x^{10} \implies (\ln y) x = 10 \ln x \quad \text{(taking natural logs)} \]

Rewrite the second equation:
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \implies 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

Let \( a = \ln x \) and \( b = \ln y \). Since \( x &gt; 1 \) and \( y &gt; 1 \), both \( a &gt; 0 \) and \( b &gt; 0 \).

Rewrite the equations:
1) \( b x = 10 a \)
2) \( 4 y a = 10 b \)

Recall \( x = e^a \), \( y = e^b \).

From equation 1:
\[ b e^a = 10 a \]
From equation 2:
\[ 4 e^b a = 10 b \]

We want to find \( xy = e^{a+b} \).

From the first equation:
\[ b = \frac{10 a}{e^a} \]

Substitute into the second equation:
\[ 4 e^b a = 10 \cdot \frac{10 a}{e^a} \implies 4 e^b a = \frac{100 a}{e^a} \]

Divide both sides by \( a \) (since \( a &gt; 0 \)):
\[ 4 e^b = \frac{100}{e^a} \implies e^b = \frac{25}{e^a} \]

Recall \( e^{a+b} = e^a e^b \), so:
\[ e^{a+b} = e^a \cdot \frac{25}{e^a} = 25 \]

Therefore, \( xy = 25 \).

### thinking by Debate Agent NwDK:
We are given two equations involving logarithms:

1) \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \)
2) \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \)

Both \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers greater than 1.

Step 1: Rewrite the logarithmic expressions using the properties of logarithms.

From the first equation:
\[ \log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10 \]

From the second equation:
\[ \log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10 \]

Step 2: From the first equation:
\[ x \log_x(y) = 10 \]
Recall that \( \log_x(y) = \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} \), where \(\ln\) is the natural logarithm.

So:
\[ x \cdot \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = 10 \implies x \ln y = 10 \ln x \]

Step 3: From the second equation:
\[ 4y \log_y(x) = 10 \]
Similarly, \( \log_y(x) = \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} \), so:
\[ 4y \cdot \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} = 10 \implies 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

Step 4: We have two equations:
\[ x \ln y = 10 \ln x \]
\[ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

Step 5: From the first equation:
\[ x \ln y = 10 \ln x \implies \ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \]

Substitute \( \ln y \) into the second equation:
\[ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y = 10 \cdot \frac{10 \ln x}{x} = \frac{100 \ln x}{x} \]

Divide both sides by \( \ln x \) (since \(x &gt; 1\), \(\ln x &gt; 0\)):
\[ 4y = \frac{100}{x} \implies y = \frac{25}{x} \]

Step 6: Recall that \( \ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \), and \( y = \frac{25}{x} \), so:
\[ \ln y = \ln \left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = \ln 25 - \ln x \]

Set equal to \( \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \):
\[ \ln 25 - \ln x = \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \]

Rearranged:
\[ \ln 25 = \ln x + \frac{10 \ln x}{x} = \ln x \left(1 + \frac{10}{x} \right) = \ln x \cdot \frac{x + 10}{x} \]

Step 7: Multiply both sides by \( \frac{x}{x+10} \):
\[ \frac{x}{x+10} \ln 25 = \ln x \]

Step 8: Exponentiate both sides:
\[ x = e^{\frac{x}{x+10} \ln 25} = 25^{\frac{x}{x+10}} \]

Step 9: Rewrite the equation:
\[ x = 25^{\frac{x}{x+10}} \]

Take logarithm base 25 on both sides:
\[ \log_{25} x = \frac{x}{x+10} \]

Step 10: Let \( t = \log_{25} x \), so:
\[ t = \frac{x}{x+10} \]

But since \( x = 25^t \), substitute back:
\[ t = \frac{25^t}{25^t + 10} \]

Multiply both sides by denominator:
\[ t (25^t + 10) = 25^t \implies t \cdot 25^t + 10 t = 25^t \]

Bring all terms to one side:
\[ t \cdot 25^t - 25^t + 10 t = 0 \implies 25^t (t - 1) + 10 t = 0 \]

Step 11: Rearrange:
\[ 25^t (t - 1) = -10 t \]

Step 12: Try to find a value of \(t\) between 0 and 1 (since \(x &gt; 1\), \(t &gt; 0\)) that satisfies this.

Try \( t = 0.5 \):
\[ 25^{0.5} = 5 \]
\[ 5 (0.5 - 1) = 5 (-0.5) = -2.5 \]
\[ -10 (0.5) = -5 \]
Not equal.

Try \( t = 0.8 \):
\[ 25^{0.8} = e^{0.8 \ln 25} \approx e^{0.8 \times 3.2189} = e^{2.575} \approx 13.13 \]
\[ 13.13 (0.8 - 1) = 13.13 (-0.2) = -2.626 \]
\[ -10 (0.8) = -8 \]
No.

Try \( t = 0.25 \):
\[ 25^{0.25} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \]
\[ 2.236 (0.25 - 1) = 2.236 (-0.75) = -1.677 \]
\[ -10 (0.25) = -2.5 \]
No.

Try \( t = 0.4 \):
\[ 25^{0.4} = e^{0.4 \times 3.2189} = e^{1.2876} \approx 3.624 \]
\[ 3.624 (0.4 - 1) = 3.624 (-0.6) = -2.174 \]
\[ -10 (0.4) = -4 \]
No.

Try \( t = 0.666... = 2/3 \):
\[ 25^{2/3} = (5^2)^{2/3} = 5^{4/3} = 5^{1 + 1/3} = 5 \times 5^{1/3} \approx 5 \times 1.710 = 8.55 \]
\[ 8.55 (2/3 - 1) = 8.55 (-1/3) = -2.85 \]
\[ -10 (2/3) = -6.66 \]
No.

Try \( t = 0.1 \):
\[ 25^{0.1} = e^{0.1 \times 3.2189} = e^{0.3219} = 1.38 \]
\[ 1.38 (0.1 - 1) = 1.38 (-0.9) = -1.24 \]
\[ -10 (0.1) = -1 \]
Close.

Try \( t = 0.12 \):
\[ 25^{0.12} = e^{0.12 \times 3.2189} = e^{0.386} = 1.47 \]
\[ 1.47 (0.12 - 1) = 1.47 (-0.88) = -1.29 \]
\[ -10 (0.12) = -1.2 \]
Closer.

Try \( t = 0.11 \):
\[ 25^{0.11} = e^{0.11 \times 3.2189} = e^{0.354} = 1.425 \]
\[ 1.425 (0.11 - 1) = 1.425 (-0.89) = -1.27 \]
\[ -10 (0.11) = -1.1 \]

The left side is about -1.27, right side -1.1, so the equality is not exact. But the value is close to \( t = 0.1 \).

Step 13: Since this is complicated, try a different approach.

Recall from Step 5:
\[ y = \frac{25}{x} \]

Step 14: Compute \( xy = x \times y = x \times \frac{25}{x} = 25 \)

Step 15: So the product \( xy = 25 \).

This is consistent with the problem, as it only asks for \( xy \).

Answer: \( \boxed{25} \).
