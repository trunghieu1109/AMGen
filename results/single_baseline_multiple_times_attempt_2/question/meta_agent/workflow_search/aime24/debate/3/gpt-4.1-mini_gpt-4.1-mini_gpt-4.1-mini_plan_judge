Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of intersection points of the system:

 y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
 x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

where f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| and g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|.

By analyzing the functions, we find that both x and y lie in [0,1]. Defining h(t) = 4 * g(f(t)) and simplifying, h(t) is a piecewise linear function on [0,1] with breakpoints at 0.25 and 0.75.

The system reduces to:

 y = h(|sin(2πx)|)
 x = h(|cos(3πy)|)

Both |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| oscillate between 0 and 1 with known periods. The function h is piecewise linear and symmetric.

The problem is to find the number of fixed points of the map (x,y) -> (h(|cos(3πy)|), h(|sin(2πx)|)) in the unit square.

Two different analyses suggest different answers: one suggests 25 intersections, the other 9. Given the complexity and the nature of the problem (likely from a contest), the higher number 25 is more consistent with the multiple oscillations and piecewise linearity creating many intersection points.

Therefore, the final answer is 25.
