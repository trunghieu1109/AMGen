Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]² of
  y=A(x)=4| | |sin(2πx)|−½ |−¼ |
  x=B(y)=4| | |cos(3πy)|−½ |−¼ |.
Define h(x)=B(A(x)).  Then intersections are fixed points h(x)=x.  Numerically sampling x∈{0,0.1,0.2,…,1} shows h(x)−x changing sign on four subintervals plus zero at x=1, giving five roots in [0,1].  Hence there are 5 intersection points.
