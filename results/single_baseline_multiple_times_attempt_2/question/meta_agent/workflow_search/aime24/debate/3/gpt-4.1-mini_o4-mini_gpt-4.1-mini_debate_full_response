One checks A(x) and B(y) are continuous piecewise-linear in |sin| and |cos| with A periodic ½ (two “triangles” on [0,1]) and B periodic 1∕3 (three “triangles” on [0,1]).  On [0,1], A has 2·4=8 monotonic pieces and B has 3·4=12.  A continuous strictly monotonic segment of A and one of B can intersect in at most one point.  Generically all such pairs do intersect, giving 8·12=96 solutions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent kvZG:\nWe need the number of solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]^2 satisfying\n  y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) ,\n  x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))\nwhere f(t)=||t|−½| and g(s)=||s|−¼|.  Equivalently define A(x)=4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and B(y)=4 g(f(cos(3πy))).  Then intersections are points where y=A(x) and x=B(y), so x must satisfy x = B(A(x)).  We approximate h(x)=B(A(x)) and seek fixed points h(x)=x over [0,1].  Sampling key values shows h(0)=1>0, h remains >x until about x≈0.6, then oscillates below and above, producing four crossings in (0,1) plus the endpoint x=1 where h(1)=1.  Hence there are 5 solutions.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Evlo:\n96\n\n### answer by Debate Agent kvZG:\n5\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
