    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent Evlo:
We need to count solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]² of y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  One checks A(x) and B(y) are continuous piecewise-linear in |sin| and |cos| with A periodic ½ (two “triangles” on [0,1]) and B periodic 1∕3 (three “triangles” on [0,1]).  On [0,1], A has 2·4=8 monotonic pieces and B has 3·4=12.  A continuous strictly monotonic segment of A and one of B can intersect in at most one point.  Generically all such pairs do intersect, giving 8·12=96 solutions.

### thinking by Debate Agent kvZG:
We need the number of solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]^2 satisfying
  y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) ,
  x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))
where f(t)=||t|−½| and g(s)=||s|−¼|.  Equivalently define A(x)=4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and B(y)=4 g(f(cos(3πy))).  Then intersections are points where y=A(x) and x=B(y), so x must satisfy x = B(A(x)).  We approximate h(x)=B(A(x)) and seek fixed points h(x)=x over [0,1].  Sampling key values shows h(0)=1&gt;0, h remains &gt;x until about x≈0.6, then oscillates below and above, producing four crossings in (0,1) plus the endpoint x=1 where h(1)=1.  Hence there are 5 solutions.

    <pre>We seek solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]² of
  y=A(x)=4| | |sin(2πx)|−½ |−¼ |
  x=B(y)=4| | |cos(3πy)|−½ |−¼ |.
Define h(x)=B(A(x)).  Then intersections are fixed points h(x)=x.  Numerically sampling x∈{0,0.1,0.2,…,1} shows h(x)−x changing sign on four subintervals plus zero at x=1, giving five roots in [0,1].  Hence there are 5 intersection points.
