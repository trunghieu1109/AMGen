    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent Pyxm:
To find the number of intersections, we need to solve the system of equations given by the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Start by analyzing the behavior of the functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Both f(x) and g(x) are piecewise linear and symmetric about the y-axis. The function f(x) has critical points at x = ±1/2 and g(x) has critical points at x = ±1/4. The function f(x) maps x into the interval [0, 1/2], and g(x) maps x into [0, 1/4]. Therefore, the composition g(f(x)) maps x into [0, 1/4], and 4g(f(x)) maps x into [0, 1]. The function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will have a period of 1 because sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Similarly, 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will have a period of 2/3 because cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3. To find intersections, solve 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y over the domain of one period. The periodicity of the system suggests the intersections will repeat every period. Since the periods are 1 and 2/3, consider the least common multiple, which is 1. Solve the system within the interval [0, 1) for both x and y.

### thinking by Debate Agent fRD8:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the functions and their compositions. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a piecewise function that describes the distance from |x| to 1/2. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| describes the distance from |x| to 1/4. We need to evaluate these functions with trigonometric inputs and then find the intersections of two transformed curves. First, let&#39;s examine f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)). Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) both range from -1 to 1, the expression |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1, and similarly for |cos(3πy)|. Thus, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| and f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. The function g then transforms these results similarly. The function g(f(x)) will have specific key values when x is 0, 1/2, or 1, due to the absolute values involved. The intersections occur when y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) have the same values for x and y. We need to consider points where both expressions are equal. By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the trigonometric functions and the piecewise linear behavior of f and g, we can determine the number of intersection points. The periodicity of sin and cos will repeat every integer x and y, and the function transformations will have periodic behavior as well. We need to count the number of solutions within one period, typically from 0 to 1, and then generalize for the repeating pattern over the entire range of x and y.
