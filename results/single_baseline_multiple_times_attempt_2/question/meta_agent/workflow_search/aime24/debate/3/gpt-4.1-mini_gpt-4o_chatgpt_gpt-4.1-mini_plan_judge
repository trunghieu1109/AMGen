Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections, we need to solve the system of equations given by y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| are piecewise linear and symmetric about the y-axis. The function f(x) maps x into the interval [0, 1/2], and g(x) maps x into [0, 1/4]. Therefore, the composition g(f(x)) maps x into [0, 1/4], and 4g(f(x)) maps x into [0, 1]. The function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will have a period of 1 because sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Similarly, 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will have a period of 2/3 because cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3. To find intersections, solve 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y over the domain of one period. The periodicity of the system suggests the intersections will repeat every period. Since the periods are 1 and 2/3, consider the least common multiple, which is 1. Solve the system within the interval [0, 1) for both x and y. By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the trigonometric functions and the piecewise linear behavior of f and g, we can determine the number of intersection points. The periodicity of sin and cos will repeat every integer x and y, and the function transformations will have periodic behavior as well. We need to count the number of solutions within one period, typically from 0 to 1, and then generalize for the repeating pattern over the entire range of x and y. The analysis shows that there are 6 intersection points within one period.
