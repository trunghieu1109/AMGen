    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent sKew:
We wish to count lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) using 8 east (E) steps and 8 north (N) steps that have exactly 4 changes of direction.  A “change of direction” occurs whenever two consecutive steps differ (E→N or N→E).  A path with exactly 4 changes has 5 monotone segments alternating E and N, each segment of length ≥1.  If the path starts with E, segments 1,3,5 are E‐runs summing to 8, and segments 2,4 are N‐runs summing to 8.  The number of positive solutions for 3 E‐runs summing to 8 is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21, and for 2 N‐runs summing to 8 is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7, giving 21·7=147 paths.  Similarly, starting with N also yields 147 paths.  Total = 147+147 = 294.

### thinking by Debate Agent NsSA:
We need the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 rights and 8 ups that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction occurs at each boundary between runs of consecutive identical moves, so we need exactly 5 runs (runs–1=4). Runs alternate between R and U; with 5 runs starting with R we have 3 R‐runs (positive integers summing to 8) and 2 U‐runs (summing to 8), giving C(7,2)·C(7,1)=21·7=147. Starting with U gives similarly 147. Total =147+147=294.

Each change of direction occurs between runs of consecutive identical moves, so such a path has 5 runs. Runs alternate E and N. Case 1: start with E → 3 E‐runs summing to 8 (positive) gives C(7,2)=21, and 2 N‐runs summing to 8 gives C(7,1)=7, so 21·7=147. Case 2: start with N similarly gives 147. Total =147+147=294.
