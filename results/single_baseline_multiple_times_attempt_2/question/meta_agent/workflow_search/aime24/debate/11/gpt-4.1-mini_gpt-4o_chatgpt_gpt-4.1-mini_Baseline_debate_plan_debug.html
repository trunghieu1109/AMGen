    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent 1Dog:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 horizontal and 8 vertical moves, making a total of 16 moves. Changing direction four times means there are five segments in the path, alternating between horizontal and vertical. We denote the lengths of these segments by \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\) for horizontal moves and \(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5\) for vertical moves. These satisfy the equations \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 8\) and \(b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 = 8\). To ensure there are exactly four direction changes, neither the horizontal nor the vertical segments can be zero, meaning \(a_i, b_i \geq 1\) for all \(i\). By setting \(a_i = x_i + 1\) and \(b_i = y_i + 1\), where \(x_i, y_i \geq 0\), we transform the equations to \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 3\) and \(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 = 3\). The number of solutions for each equation is given by the stars and bars method, \(\binom{3+5-1}{5-1} = \binom{7}{4} = 35\). Therefore, the total number of paths is the product of the number of solutions for the horizontal and vertical equations, \(35 \times 35 = 1225\).

### thinking by Debate Agent ZUE9:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, changing direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 horizontal (H) and 8 vertical (V) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction four times implies there are exactly five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical. We need to distribute the 8 H&#39;s and 8 V&#39;s into these five segments. The changes can be in the form of HVHVH or VHVHV, with each segment containing at least one move. We can distribute the moves among the segments using the stars and bars method to ensure each segment has at least one move. We calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining moves after assigning one move to each segment. This involves calculating combinations for distributing the remaining 3 H&#39;s and 3 V&#39;s among the segments.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 horizontal (H) and 8 vertical (V) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction four times means there are five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical. We can have two patterns: HVHVH or VHVHV. For each pattern, we need to distribute the 8 H&#39;s and 8 V&#39;s into these five segments, ensuring each segment has at least one move. For the HVHVH pattern, we have 3 extra H&#39;s and 3 extra V&#39;s to distribute among the 5 segments. Using the stars and bars method, the number of ways to distribute 3 extra H&#39;s into 5 segments is \( \binom{3+5-1}{5-1} = \binom{7}{4} = 35 \). Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 3 extra V&#39;s into 5 segments is also 35. Therefore, for the HVHVH pattern, there are 35 * 35 = 1225 ways. The same calculation applies to the VHVHV pattern, giving another 1225 ways. Thus, the total number of paths is 1225 + 1225 = 2450.
