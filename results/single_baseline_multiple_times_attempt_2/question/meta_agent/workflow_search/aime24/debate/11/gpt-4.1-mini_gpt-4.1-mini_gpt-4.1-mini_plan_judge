Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid, moving only right (R) or up (U), with exactly 4 changes in direction. Each path has 16 steps: 8 R and 8 U. A change in direction means switching from R to U or U to R. Having exactly 4 changes means the path consists of 5 runs (segments) alternating between R and U. The path can start with either R or U. If it starts with R, the runs are R-U-R-U-R (3 R runs and 2 U runs), and if it starts with U, the runs are U-R-U-R-U (3 U runs and 2 R runs). The sum of lengths of R runs is 8, and the sum of lengths of U runs is 8. Counting positive integer solutions for run lengths: For 3 runs summing to 8, the number of solutions is C(7,2) = 21; for 2 runs summing to 8, the number of solutions is C(7,1) = 7. For each starting direction, total combinations are 21 * 7 = 147. Summing both cases gives 147 + 147 = 294. Each run length combination corresponds to a unique path, so the total number of such paths is 294.
