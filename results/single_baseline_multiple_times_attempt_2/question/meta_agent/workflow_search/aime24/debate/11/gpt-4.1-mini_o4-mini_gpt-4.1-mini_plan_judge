Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 east and 8 north steps that change direction exactly 4 times. Each change of direction occurs between runs of consecutive identical moves, so such a path has 5 runs. Runs alternate E and N. Case 1: start with E → 3 E‐runs summing to 8 (positive) gives C(7,2)=21, and 2 N‐runs summing to 8 gives C(7,1)=7, so 21·7=147. Case 2: start with N similarly gives 147. Total =147+147=294.
