Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 horizontal (H) and 8 vertical (V) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction four times means there are five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical. We can have two patterns: HVHVH or VHVHV. For each pattern, we need to distribute the 8 H's and 8 V's into these five segments, ensuring each segment has at least one move. For the HVHVH pattern, we have 3 extra H's and 3 extra V's to distribute among the 5 segments. Using the stars and bars method, the number of ways to distribute 3 extra H's into 5 segments is \( \binom{3+5-1}{5-1} = \binom{7}{4} = 35 \). Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 3 extra V's into 5 segments is also 35. Therefore, for the HVHVH pattern, there are 35 * 35 = 1225 ways. The same calculation applies to the VHVHV pattern, giving another 1225 ways. Thus, the total number of paths is 1225 + 1225 = 2450.
