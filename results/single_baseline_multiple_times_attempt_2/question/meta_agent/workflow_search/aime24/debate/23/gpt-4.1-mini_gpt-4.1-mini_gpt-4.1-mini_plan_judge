Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. The problem gives two conditions: the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Writing these as equations: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Grouping terms, we define X = a + d, Y = b + e, Z = c + f, leading to 100X + 10Y + Z = 999. The only triple (X,Y,Z) with digits sums ≤ 18 satisfying this is (9,9,9). From the second equation, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99, and since d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c) (because a + d = 9, etc.), we get 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99, so a + b + c = 8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is C(10,2) = 45. For each such triple, d,e,f are uniquely determined as 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c, which are valid digits. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the digits is 45.
