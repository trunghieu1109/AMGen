    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent VT5M:
Let&#39;s denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as:

| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |

The two numbers formed by reading left to right are:
  Number 1 (top row): 100a + 10b + c
  Number 2 (bottom row): 100d + 10e + f

Their sum is 999:
  (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

The three numbers formed by reading top to bottom are:
  Number 3 (first column): 10a + d
  Number 4 (second column): 10b + e
  Number 5 (third column): 10c + f

Their sum is 99:
  (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

We have two equations:
1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2) (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Rewrite the second equation:
  10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
  (10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99
  10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

From the first equation:
  100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Group terms:
  100a + 100d + 10b + 10e + c + f = 999
  100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

From the second equation:
  10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

We want digits a,b,c,d,e,f from 0 to 9.

Let&#39;s denote:
  A = a + d
  B = b + e
  C = c + f

From first equation:
  100A + 10B + C = 999
From second equation:
  10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
But (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = A + B + C
So:
  10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 10(a + b + c) + (A + B + C - (a + b + c)) = 10(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) - (a + b + c) = 9(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) = 99

Since A + B + C = 999/100 + ... but 100A + 10B + C = 999
So A, B, C are digits sums (0 to 18), but 100A + 10B + C = 999
Try to find A, B, C such that 100A + 10B + C = 999

Try A = 9:
  100*9 = 900
  999 - 900 = 99
  So 10B + C = 99
  So B = 9, C = 9

So A=9, B=9, C=9

From second equation:
  9(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) = 99
  9(a + b + c) + 9 + 9 + 9 = 99
  9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
  9(a + b + c) = 72
  a + b + c = 8

We have:
- a + d = 9
- b + e = 9
- c + f = 9
- a + b + c = 8
- all digits 0 to 9

Since a + d = 9, d = 9 - a
Similarly, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c

We need to count the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0 to 9, sum to 8, and for each, the corresponding (d,e,f) are digits (0 to 9), which they will be because 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c will be between 0 and 9.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of (a,b,c) with digits 0 to 9, sum 8.

Number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with a,b,c ≤ 9 is the number of solutions to a + b + c = 8 without any upper bound since 8 ≤ 9.

Number of solutions = C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10,2) = 45

Therefore, there are 45 ways to place the digits satisfying the conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9O8y:
Let&#39;s denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as:

| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |

From the problem, the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999:

The two numbers are abc and def, so:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Similarly, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99:

The three numbers are ad, be, cf, so:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

We have two equations:
1) (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2) (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Rewrite the second equation:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
=&gt; 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

From the first equation:
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
=&gt; 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Group terms:
(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999
=&gt; 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Now, define:
X = a + d
Y = b + e
Z = c + f

Then the first equation becomes:
100X + 10Y + Z = 999

The second equation becomes:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Since X = a + d, Y = b + e, Z = c + f,
(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = X + Y + Z

But the second equation is:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
= 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let S = a + b + c
and T = d + e + f
Then:
10S + T = 99

From above, X = a + d, Y = b + e, Z = c + f
Sum X + Y + Z = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S + T

So we have:
S + T = X + Y + Z

From the first equation:
100X + 10Y + Z = 999

From the second equation:
10S + T = 99

We want to count the number of ways to assign digits (0 to 9) to a,b,c,d,e,f that satisfy these equations.

Step 1: Find all possible triples (X,Y,Z) with X,Y,Z in [0..18] (since a,d,b,e,c,f are digits 0-9, sums can be up to 18) such that:
100X + 10Y + Z = 999

Check possible values for X:
Since 100X must be less than or equal to 999, X can be from 0 to 9.
Try X from 0 to 9:
- X=9 =&gt; 100*9=900, remainder 99
  So 10Y + Z = 99
  Y can be from 0 to 18, but 10Y ≤ 99
  Try Y=9 =&gt; 10*9=90, Z=9
  So (X,Y,Z) = (9,9,9)

Check if other values fit:
- X=9, Y=9, Z=9 is the only triple that satisfies 100X + 10Y + Z = 999

So (X,Y,Z) = (9,9,9)

Step 2: From second equation:
10S + T = 99
Where S = a + b + c, T = d + e + f

We also have:
X = a + d = 9
Y = b + e = 9
Z = c + f = 9

We want to find the number of digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) with digits 0-9 such that:
- a + d = 9
- b + e = 9
- c + f = 9
- 10S + T = 99, where S = a + b + c, T = d + e + f

Since a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9,
S = a + b + c
T = d + e + f = (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - S

Then 10S + T = 99
=&gt; 10S + (27 - S) = 99
=&gt; 9S + 27 = 99
=&gt; 9S = 72
=&gt; S = 8

So S = 8 and T = 27 - 8 = 19

Step 3: Count the number of (a,b,c,d,e,f) with digits 0-9 such that:
- a + d = 9
- b + e = 9
- c + f = 9
- a + b + c = 8
- d + e + f = 19

Since a + d = 9, d = 9 - a
Similarly e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c

We only need to count the number of (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that a + b + c = 8
Because d,e,f are determined by a,b,c

Step 4: Count the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) to a + b + c = 8 with each ≤ 9
Since 8 ≤ 9*3, no upper bound restriction applies here.
Number of solutions = C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45

Therefore, there are 45 ways to assign (a,b,c), and for each, d,e,f are uniquely determined.

Step 5: Verify that d,e,f are digits (0-9):
Since a,b,c ≤ 8 (because sum is 8), each a,b,c ≤ 8
Therefore, d = 9 - a ≥ 1 and ≤ 9
Similarly for e and f
So d,e,f are digits 1 to 9

Hence all are valid digits

Answer: 45 ways

    <pre>We denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. The problem gives two conditions: the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Writing these as equations: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Grouping terms, we define X = a + d, Y = b + e, Z = c + f, leading to 100X + 10Y + Z = 999. The only triple (X,Y,Z) with digits sums ≤ 18 satisfying this is (9,9,9). From the second equation, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99, and since d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c) (because a + d = 9, etc.), we get 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99, so a + b + c = 8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is C(10,2) = 45. For each such triple, d,e,f are uniquely determined as 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c, which are valid digits. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the digits is 45.
