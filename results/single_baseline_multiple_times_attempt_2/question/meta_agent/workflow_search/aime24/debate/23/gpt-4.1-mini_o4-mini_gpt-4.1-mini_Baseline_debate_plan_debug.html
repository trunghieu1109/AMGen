    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent TiFK:
Let the grid be
 a b c
 d e f
with digits 0–9. Reading rows gives two 3-digit numbers S1=100a+10b+c and S2=100d+10e+f, and we require S1+S2=999. Reading columns gives three 2-digit numbers 10a+d, 10b+e, 10c+f, whose sum is 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99.  
Let T=a+b+c and U=d+e+f. Then 10T+U=99, so U=99−10T. Also from S1+S2=999 one sees U=27−T (since the digit sum of 999−S1 is 27−(digit sum of S1)). Equating gives 27−T=99−10T =&gt;9T=72=&gt;T=8, then U=19.  
Thus a+b+c=8. The number of nonnegative digit triples (a,b,c) summing to 8 with each ≤9 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.  
For each such (a,b,c), S2=999−S1 yields valid digits (d,e,f) summing to 19 automatically, and both row and column sums conditions hold.  
Therefore there are 45 solutions.

### thinking by Debate Agent vgfT:
Label the grid entries as a11,a12,a13 in row 1 and a21,a22,a23 in row 2.  The row‐sum condition A+B=999 with A=100a11+10a12+a13 and B=100a21+10a22+a23 forces a11+a21=9, a12+a22=9, a13+a23=9.  The column‐sum condition 10(a11+a12+a13)+(a21+a22+a23)=99 then becomes 9(a11+a12+a13)=72, so a11+a12+a13=8.  Any nonnegative triple (a11,a12,a13) summing to 8 with each ≤9 works, and determines (a21,a22,a23) uniquely by a2j=9−a1j, which lies between 0 and 9.  The number of nonnegative solutions to a11+a12+a13=8 is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.

    <pre>Label the top row digits a,b,c and bottom row d,e,f. Row condition: 100a+10b+c + 100d+10e+f = 999 implies a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. Column condition: (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 ⇒ 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. Using d+e+f = 27−(a+b+c), we get 10T + (27−T) = 99 ⇒ 9T = 72 ⇒ T = a+b+c = 8. The number of nonnegative digit triples (a,b,c) summing to 8 with each ≤9 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45. Each determines a unique valid bottom row. So there are 45 solutions.
