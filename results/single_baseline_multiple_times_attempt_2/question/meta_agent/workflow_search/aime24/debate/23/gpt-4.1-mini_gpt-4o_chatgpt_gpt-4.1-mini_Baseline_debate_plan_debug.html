    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent 6bTN:
We need to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading rows left to right equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading columns top to bottom equals 99. Let&#39;s denote the grid as follows: 

\[ \begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \end{array} \]

The conditions are: 

1. \( abc + def = 999 \)
2. \( a + d = 9 \)
3. \( b + e = 9 \)
4. \( c + f = 9 \)

From condition 2, we have \( d = 9 - a \). From condition 3, \( e = 9 - b \). From condition 4, \( f = 9 - c \).

Substitute these into the first condition:

\[ 100a + 10b + c + 100(9-a) + 10(9-b) + (9-c) = 999 \]

Simplify:

\[ 100a + 10b + c + 900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 9 - c = 999 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 999 = 999 \]

This equation is always true, indicating that any assignment of \( a, b, c \) satisfying the conditions will work. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to assign \( a, b, c \) such that each sum with its corresponding lower row digit equals 9.

For each column, there are 10 possible (digit) pairs that sum to 9:

- For the first column: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0)
- For the second column: Same 10 pairs as above
- For the third column: Same 10 pairs as above

Thus, the total number of ways is the product of the number of ways for each column:

\( 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000 \)

This is because each column&#39;s choice is independent of the others.

### thinking by Debate Agent UoH5:
To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let&#39;s denote the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The numbers formed by reading left to right are (abc) and (def), so we have: abc + def = 999. The numbers formed by reading top to bottom are a+d, b+e, and c+f, so we have: a+d + b+e + c+f = 99. First, let&#39;s express abc and def in terms of their digits: abc = 100a + 10b + c, def = 100d + 10e + f. So, the equation abc + def = 999 becomes: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. Simplifying, we get: 100(a+d) + 10(b+e) + (c+f) = 999. Since a+d + b+e + c+f = 99, let&#39;s substitute this into the equation: 100(a+d) + 10(b+e) + (c+f) = 999, a+d + b+e + c+f = 99. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get a+d = 9, b+e = 9, c+f = 81. Now, let&#39;s find the number of solutions: For a+d = 9, the pairs (a, d) can be (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0), which gives 10 solutions. For b+e = 9, the pairs (b, e) can be the same as (a, d), which also gives 10 solutions. For c+f = 81, the only pair (c, f) that satisfies this is (0,81), which is not possible since f must be a single digit, so we must have c=81 and f=0. Thus, the only arrangement is when the numbers are 0 and 81, which is not possible. Therefore, the answer is that there are no solutions.
