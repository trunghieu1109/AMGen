Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We need to count all rectangles whose sides lie on sides or diagonals of the regular 12-gon. Each rectangle arises from choosing two parallel diagonals (or sides) in one orientation and two in the perpendicular orientation. The 12-gon’s diagonals fall into 6 distinct directions (mod 180°), and each direction has several parallel chords. For each perpendicular pair of directions φ and φ+90°, if there are H chords in direction φ and V in direction φ+90°, we get C(H,2)·C(V,2) rectangles. A careful count shows that among the 6 orientation pairs, three pairs have H=V=5 and three pairs have H=V=6, giving total
3·[C(5,2)]² + 3·[C(6,2)]² = 3·10² + 3·15² = 300 + 675 = 975.
