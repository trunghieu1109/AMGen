    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent OHSk:
We note that any rectangle whose sides lie on the sides or diagonals of the regular 12-gon must be a cyclic parallelogram with right angles, hence its two diagonals are diameters of the circumcircle.  There are exactly 6 diameters (pairs of opposite vertices), and any choice of two distinct diameters gives one rectangle.  Thus the number of rectangles is C(6,2)=15.

### thinking by Debate Agent BXVy:
We need to count all rectangles whose sides lie along sides or diagonals of the regular 12‐gon.  Each side or diagonal of the 12‐gon has one of 12 possible orientations (spaced 15° apart), and a rectangle must use two perpendicular orientations.  There are 6 such perpendicular orientation‐pairs.  For each orientation‐pair, count the number of chords (sides or diagonals) parallel to one orientation (H) and the number parallel to its perpendicular (V).  A direct count shows that in 3 of the orientation‐pairs H=V=5, and in the other 3 H=V=6.  From H parallel “horizontal” lines we choose any 2, and from V parallel “vertical” lines we choose any 2 to form a rectangle, giving C(H,2)*C(V,2) rectangles per orientation‐pair.  Thus the total number is
3·[C(5,2)]² + 3·[C(6,2)]² = 3·10² + 3·15² = 300 + 675 = 975.

    <pre>We need to count all rectangles whose sides lie on sides or diagonals of the regular 12-gon. Each rectangle arises from choosing two parallel diagonals (or sides) in one orientation and two in the perpendicular orientation. The 12-gon’s diagonals fall into 6 distinct directions (mod 180°), and each direction has several parallel chords. For each perpendicular pair of directions φ and φ+90°, if there are H chords in direction φ and V in direction φ+90°, we get C(H,2)·C(V,2) rectangles. A careful count shows that among the 6 orientation pairs, three pairs have H=V=5 and three pairs have H=V=6, giving total
3·[C(5,2)]² + 3·[C(6,2)]² = 3·10² + 3·15² = 300 + 675 = 975.
