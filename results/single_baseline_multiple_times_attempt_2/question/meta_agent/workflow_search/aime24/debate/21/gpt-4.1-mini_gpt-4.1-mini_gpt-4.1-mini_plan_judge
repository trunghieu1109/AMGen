Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We are asked to find the number of rectangles formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The vertices of the dodecagon lie on a circle, equally spaced at 30° intervals. Rectangles inscribed in a circle must have their vertices such that opposite vertices are 180° apart (diametrically opposite). Since the polygon has 12 vertices, the opposite vertex of vertex i is vertex (i+6) mod 12. Thus, there are 6 pairs of opposite vertices: (0,6), (1,7), (2,8), (3,9), (4,10), (5,11). To form a rectangle, we select two distinct pairs of opposite vertices, giving vertices {i, j, i+6, j+6}. Each such selection corresponds to a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs from 6 is C(6,2) = 15. Each rectangle's sides are chords of the polygon (edges or diagonals), so all these rectangles satisfy the condition. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 15.
