Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices and the possible pairs of parallel lines. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, there are several sets of parallel lines: the sides (adjacent vertices), diagonals skipping 1 vertex, diagonals skipping 2 vertices, and so on, up to diagonals skipping 5 vertices. For each set of parallel lines, we can choose two lines from the set to form opposite sides of a rectangle. The number of ways to choose two parallel lines from a set of lines is combinatorial. We need to consider all possible combinations of these parallel line pairs. The number of ways to choose two lines from a set of n parallel lines is C(n, 2). For a regular dodecagon, there are 6 sets of parallel lines (sides and diagonals), each with 6 lines. Therefore, the number of rectangles is 6 * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90. However, this counts each rectangle twice (once for each pair of opposite sides), so we divide by 2 to get 45. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 45.
