    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent ncMI:
To solve the problem, we need to determine a list of positive integers that satisfies all the conditions: the sum of the items is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. Let&#39;s denote the list as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_i\) are positive integers. Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s assume there are \(k\) occurrences of 9. Since 9 is the mode, \(k &gt; 1\). The median is not in the list, so the number of elements, \(n\), must be even. Suppose there are two 9s, then the sum of the remaining numbers is \(30 - 18 = 12\). We need to distribute this sum among the remaining numbers such that the mode remains 9 and the median is not in the list. Let&#39;s try with \(n = 6\) (an even number): \([9, 9, x, x, y, z]\). The median would be the average of the third and fourth elements, which is \((x + x)/2 = x\), so \(x\) cannot be in the list. Let&#39;s try \(x = 5\), then \(y + z = 2\). The only possibility that satisfies this is \(y = 1, z = 1\). Thus, a possible list is \([9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 5]\), which satisfies all conditions. Now, compute the sum of squares: \(9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 = 81 + 81 + 1 + 1 + 25 + 25\).

### thinking by Debate Agent sazF:
To solve this problem, we must construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions. Let&#39;s denote the list as L with n elements. The conditions are:
1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer not in the list.

First, since the unique mode is 9, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears at least twice for simplicity and to ensure it&#39;s the mode.

Next, for the median to be a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. This is because the median of an odd-length list is one of the elements, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, n must be even.

Let&#39;s try n = 6, a small even number that might work:

For n = 6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. To ensure the median is not in the list, these elements must average to a number not in the list.

Now, let&#39;s construct the list:

Assume the list is [a, b, 9, 9, c, d]. The sum is 30, so a + b + 9 + 9 + c + d = 30, which simplifies to a + b + c + d = 12.

Let the median be 8, which is not in the list. Then (9 + c)/2 = 8, giving c = 7.

Now, a + b + d = 5. To ensure 9 is the unique mode, we can try a = 1, b = 2, and d = 2.

Thus, the list is [1, 2, 9, 9, 7, 2]. This satisfies all conditions:
- Sum: 1 + 2 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 2 = 30.
- Unique mode: 9 appears twice, more than any other number.
- Median: (9 + 7)/2 = 8, which is not in the list.

Now, calculate the sum of the squares:
1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 7^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 + 81 + 81 + 49 + 4 = 220.
