Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires a list of positive integers summing to 30, with a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The median not being in the list implies the list length is even, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be consecutive integers surrounding the median integer. The mode 9 must appear more times than any other number. After extensive trials with various list lengths and compositions, the list [1,1,1,9,9,9] satisfies all conditions: sum is 30, mode is uniquely 9 (appearing 3 times), median is (1+9)/2=5, which is an integer not in the list. The sum of squares is 1^2+1^2+1^2+9^2+9^2+9^2 = 3 + 243 = 246.
