    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent q5oH:
Let the list be sorted and have n elements. The sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. The median is an integer not in the list, so the list length n must be even (since the median is the average of the two middle elements, and for the median to be an integer not in the list, the two middle elements must be distinct integers whose average is an integer not in the list). Let&#39;s try to find such a list.

Step 1: Let n be even, say n=6 (start with small even number).

Step 2: The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements (sorted). The median is an integer not in the list.

Step 3: 9 is the unique mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Step 4: Try to construct such a list.

Try n=6:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Median = (a_3 + a_4)/2 = integer not in list
Since median not in list, a_3 and a_4 must be two consecutive integers whose average is not in the list.

Try a_3=8, a_4=10, median=9 (which is not in the list because 9 is missing from positions 1-6 except for the mode 9s).
But 9 must be the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So we can have multiple 9s in the list.

Try to place 9s in positions 5 and 6 to ensure mode 9.

Try list: [7,8,8,10,9,9]
Sum: 7+8+8+10+9+9=51 &gt;30, too big.

Try smaller numbers.

Try [1,8,8,10,9,9]: sum=1+8+8+10+9+9=45 &gt;30

Check median: positions 3 and 4 are 3 and 6, median=(3+6)/2=4.5, not integer.

Median must be integer, so n=6 doesn&#39;t work.

Try n=4:
Median = (a_2 + a_3)/2 integer not in list
Try a_2=4, a_3=6, median=5 (integer not in list if 5 not in list)
Try list: [3,4,6,9,9] but n=5.

Try n=5:
Median = a_3 integer not in list
Median must be integer not in list, so a_3 is median, so median must be integer not in list, so a_3 not in list? Impossible.

Try n=7:
Median = a_4 integer not in list
Try a_4=5, median=5 not in list
Try list with 9 as unique mode.

### thinking by Debate Agent MOok:
Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. The list consists of positive integers.
2. The sum of the list is 30.
3. The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
4. The median is a positive integer that does NOT appear in the list.

Let&#39;s denote the list as sorted: a_1 &lt;= a_2 &lt;= ... &lt;= a_n.

Because the median is not in the list, the list length must be even (median is average of two middle numbers).

Let the list length be n (even).

We want the median = (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 + 1}) / 2 = m, where m is a positive integer not in the list.

Since m is not in the list, a_{n/2} and a_{n/2 + 1} must be two consecutive integers surrounding m.

So, a_{n/2} = m - 1 and a_{n/2 + 1} = m + 1.

Now, the mode is 9 and unique. So 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let&#39;s try to find such a list.

Try n=6 (small even number).

Median is average of a_3 and a_4.

Let median = m.

Then a_3 = m - 1, a_4 = m + 1.

Let&#39;s try m=5 (median=5, not in list).

So a_3=4, a_4=6.

Now, the list is: a_1, a_2, 4, 6, a_5, a_6.

Sum is 30.

We know the mode is 9 and unique.

So 9 must appear more than any other number.

Let&#39;s include two 9&#39;s to ensure mode is 9.

Try placing 9&#39;s at a_5 and a_6.

List: a_1, a_2, 4, 6, 9, 9.

Sum = a_1 + a_2 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = a_1 + a_2 + 28 = 30 =&gt; a_1 + a_2 = 2.

Since positive integers, a_1 and a_2 sum to 2, so both are 1.

List: 1, 1, 4, 6, 9, 9.

Check the mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears twice, so mode is not unique.

Try 3 n=7 (odd length).

Median is a_4.

Median is integer not in list, so median can&#39;t be a list element.

So median is a_4, which is in the list, so contradiction.

Try n=8.

Median is average of a_4 and a_5.

Let median = m.

Then a_4 = m - 1, a_5 = m + 1.

Try m=5.

Then a_4=4, a_5=6.

List: a_1, a_2, a_3, 4, 6, a_6, a_7, a_8.

Mode is 9 unique.

Include three 9&#39;s at the end: a_6=9, a_7=9, a_8=9.

Sum so far: 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 37.

Sum is 30, so too big.

Try two 9&#39;s: sum of 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 28.

Then a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2.

Not possible with positive integers.

Try m=4.

a_4=3, a_5=5.

Sum a_4 + a_5 = 8.

Include three 9&#39;s: 9+9+9=27.

Sum so far: 8+27=35.

Too big.

Try two 9&#39;s: sum=8+18=26.

a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4.

Possible: 1,1,2.

List: 1,1,2,3,5,9,9.

Wait, length is 7, but we assumed 8.

Try n=7.

Median is a_4.

Median is integer not in list, so a_4 not in list, contradiction.

Try m=3.

a_4=2, a_5=4.

Sum of these two=6.

Add two 9&#39;s=18.

Sum=24.

a_1+a_2+a_3=6.

Try 1,2,3.

List: 1,2,3,2,4,9,9.

Sorted: 1,2,2,3,4,9,9.

Median is a_4=3.

3 is in list, contradicting median not in list.

Try m=7.

a_4=6, a_5=8.

Sum=14.

Add two 9&#39;s=18.

Total=32 plus a_1,a_2,a_3=30, no.

Try m=6.

a_4=5, a_5=7.

Sum=12.

Add two 9&#39;s=18.

Total=30.

a_1+a_2+a_3=0.

No.

Try m=8.

a_4=7, a_5=9.

Median= (7+9)/2=8.

But 9 in list, so median 8 not in list.

But 9 in list, 7 in list.

Sum a_4 + a_5 = 7 + 9 =16.

Add two 9&#39;s: 9,9 at a_6,a_7 sum to 18.

Total sum=16+18=34 plus a_1+a_2+a_3.

Too big.

Try only one 9 to keep mode unique.

But mode 9 unique means 9 appears more than any other number.

Try n=5.

Median is a_3.

Median integer not in list, so a_3 not in list, contradiction.

Try n=4.

Median is average of a_2 and a_3.

Median integer not in list.

Try m=5.

a_2=4, a_3=6.

Sum 4+6=10.

Add two 9&#39;s=18.

Sum=28.

a_1=2.

List: 2,4,6,9,9.

Length 5, median a_3=6 in list, no.

Try n=6.

Median average a_3 and a_4.

m=7.

a_3=6, a_4=8.

Sum 14.

Add three 9&#39;s=27.

Sum 41.

Too big.

Try m=6.

a_3=5, a_4=7.

Sum 12.

    <pre>The problem requires a list of positive integers summing to 30, with a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The median not being in the list implies the list length is even, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be consecutive integers surrounding the median integer. The mode 9 must appear more times than any other number. After extensive trials with various list lengths and compositions, the list [1,1,1,9,9,9] satisfies all conditions: sum is 30, mode is uniquely 9 (appearing 3 times), median is (1+9)/2=5, which is an integer not in the list. The sum of squares is 1^2+1^2+1^2+9^2+9^2+9^2 = 3 + 243 = 246.
