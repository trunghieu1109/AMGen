Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need a positive-integer list summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and median an integer not in the list. An even number of terms gives an integer median. Testing n=4 with two 9s and two other positives summing to 12 yields [5,7,9,9]. Its median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list, and 9 is the unique mode. Sum of squares is 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=236.
