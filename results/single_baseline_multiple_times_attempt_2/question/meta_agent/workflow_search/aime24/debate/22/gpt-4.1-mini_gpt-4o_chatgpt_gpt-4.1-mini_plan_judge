Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions: the sum of the items is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be an average of two numbers. Let's try n = 6, which is a small even number. Assume the list is [a, b, 9, 9, c, d]. The sum is 30, so a + b + 9 + 9 + c + d = 30, which simplifies to a + b + c + d = 12. Let the median be 8, which is not in the list. Then (9 + c)/2 = 8, giving c = 7. Now, a + b + d = 5. To ensure 9 is the unique mode, we can try a = 1, b = 2, and d = 2. Thus, the list is [1, 2, 9, 9, 7, 2]. This satisfies all conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is 8, which is not in the list. Now, calculate the sum of the squares: 1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 7^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 + 81 + 81 + 49 + 4 = 220.
