Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires placing chips on a 5x5 grid with constraints that each row and column is monochromatic and that the placement is maximal. Each row and column can be assigned a color (white or black). A cell contains a chip if and only if the row and column colors match. Maximality means all such cells are occupied. The total number of ways to assign colors to rows and columns is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. However, some assignments produce no chips (empty grid), which is not maximal because we can add chips without violating conditions. The number of such empty configurations corresponds to pairs of subsets of rows and columns with no intersection in white color assignments. Calculating this yields 243 empty configurations. Subtracting these from 1024 gives 781 maximal configurations with at least one chip placed. Therefore, the correct count of maximal placements is 781.
