    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent UW3d:
We characterize maximal placements by assigning each of the 5 rows a color r(i)∈{W,B} and each of the 5 columns a color c(j)∈{W,B}, then placing chips in exactly those cells (i,j) with r(i)=c(j).  Maximality forces every row and every column to contain at least one chip, which means for any color X∈{W,B}, the set of rows colored X is empty exactly when the set of columns colored X is empty.  There are exactly 2 assignments where all rows and columns are W (resp. all B), and (2^5−2)^2 assignments where both colors appear among rows and among columns.  Hence the total number is 1+1+30×30=902.

### thinking by Debate Agent ACfS:
We need maximal placements so that in each row and column all chips have the same color and no empty cell can accept a chip without violating this.  One finds that every row and column must have at least one chip and that the filled cells are exactly those where the row color equals the column color.  Assigning k white rows and ℓ white columns yields a unique placement if and only if either k=ℓ=0, k=ℓ=5, or 1≤k,ℓ≤4.  The total number of choices is ∑_{k=1..4}∑_{ℓ=1..4}C(5,k)C(5,ℓ)+1+1 =30·30+2=902.

    <pre>We need maximal placements on a 5×5 grid with at most one chip per cell, uniform color in each row and column, and no further chip can be added. One shows that any maximal placement corresponds to choosing row colors r(i) and column colors c(j) in {W,B} so that both W and B appear among the chosen rows and among the chosen columns (to avoid empty rows or columns), except for the two trivial all-white or all-black full grids. There are (2^5−2)^2=900 ways when both colors appear in rows and columns, plus 2 full-grid cases, giving 902 total.
