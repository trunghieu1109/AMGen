Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need maximal placements on a 5×5 grid with at most one chip per cell, uniform color in each row and column, and no further chip can be added. One shows that any maximal placement corresponds to choosing row colors r(i) and column colors c(j) in {W,B} so that both W and B appear among the chosen rows and among the chosen columns (to avoid empty rows or columns), except for the two trivial all-white or all-black full grids. There are (2^5−2)^2=900 ways when both colors appear in rows and columns, plus 2 full-grid cases, giving 902 total.
