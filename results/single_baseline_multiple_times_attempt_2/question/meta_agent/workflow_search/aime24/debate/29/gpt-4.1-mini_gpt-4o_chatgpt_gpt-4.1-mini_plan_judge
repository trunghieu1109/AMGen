Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to place the chips such that each row and column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and a 5x5 grid. Each row and column must be entirely one color. We can choose k rows to be filled with white chips, and then k columns must also be filled with white chips to maintain the monochromatic condition. The remaining rows and columns will be filled with black chips. The number of ways to choose k rows and k columns to be white is C(5, k) * C(5, k). We sum this over all k from 0 to 5. This gives us the total number of ways to fill the grid while satisfying the conditions. The sum is: C(5,0)^2 + C(5,1)^2 + C(5,2)^2 + C(5,3)^2 + C(5,4)^2 + C(5,5)^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252.
