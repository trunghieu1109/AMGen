    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent LV9A:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how to place the chips such that each row and column contains chips of a single color, and the placement is maximal without violating this condition. A key observation is that each row and column in a 5x5 grid can either be entirely filled with white chips or entirely filled with black chips, but not both. The maximal placement occurs when we fill either all rows or all columns with chips of the same color. If we fill all rows with white chips, then each column can only have white chips, and any additional chip would violate the condition. Similarly, if we fill all columns with black chips, then each row can only have black chips. Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is determined by choosing either all rows or all columns to be filled with chips of one color. Since there are 2 colors, there are 2 ways to fill the grid (all white or all black).

### thinking by Debate Agent L8QQ:
To solve this problem, we first note that each row and each column must be monochromatic, meaning all chips in a row or column must be of the same color. Since there are 25 cells in the grid, and we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, the grid must be filled completely. 

Consider the placement of chips row by row. Each row must be entirely white or entirely black. Similarly, each column must also be entirely white or entirely black. 

If we start by placing white chips in the first row, then the entire first row must be white. Similarly, if we place black chips in the first row, the entire row must be black. 

For the grid to be filled entirely without violating any conditions, the number of rows with white chips must equal the number of columns with white chips, and similarly for black chips. 

This means we can choose any number k (0 ≤ k ≤ 5) for the number of rows filled with white chips (and hence the number of columns filled with white chips will also be k). 

Thus, the number of ways to choose k rows and k columns to be filled with white chips is given by choosing k rows from 5 and k columns from 5, which is C(5, k) * C(5, k). 

The total number of ways is the sum of these products over all possible k values from 0 to 5.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to place the chips such that each row and column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and a 5x5 grid. Each row and column must be entirely one color. We can choose k rows to be filled with white chips, and then k columns must also be filled with white chips to maintain the monochromatic condition. The remaining rows and columns will be filled with black chips. The number of ways to choose k rows and k columns to be white is C(5, k) * C(5, k). We sum this over all k from 0 to 5. This gives us the total number of ways to fill the grid while satisfying the conditions. The sum is: C(5,0)^2 + C(5,1)^2 + C(5,2)^2 + C(5,3)^2 + C(5,4)^2 + C(5,5)^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252.
