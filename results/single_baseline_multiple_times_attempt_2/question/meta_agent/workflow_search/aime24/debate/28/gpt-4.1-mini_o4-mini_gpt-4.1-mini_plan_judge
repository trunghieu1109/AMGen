Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We position the torus so its axis is vertical at height h, and parametrize torus points by angles θ,φ: x=(6+3 cosθ)cosφ, y=(6+3 cosθ)sinφ, z=h+3 sinθ.  The distance squared to the sphere center is f(θ)=(6+3 cosθ)^2+(h+3 sinθ)^2=h^2+45+36 cosθ+6h sinθ.  Its extrema are h^2+45±6√(h^2+36).  Setting the minimum equal to 121 gives h^2=160 ⇒ h=4√10, and the concave‐side contact circle has radius ρ=6+3 cosθ_min with cosθ_min=−6/√196=−3/7, so ρ=6−9/7=33/7.  Setting the maximum equal to 121 gives h^2=28 ⇒ h=√28, and the convex‐side contact circle has ρ=6+3 cosθ_max with cosθ_max=6/√64=3/4, so ρ=6+9/4=33/4.  The two contact‐circle radii are 33/7 and 33/4, so their difference is |33/4−33/7|=99/28, with m=99,n=28, m+n=127.
