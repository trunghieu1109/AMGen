Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 29m4', content='We position the torus so its axis is vertical at height h, and parametrize torus points by angles θ,φ: x=(6+3\u2009cosθ)cosφ, y=(6+3\u2009cosθ)sinφ, z=h+3\u2009sinθ.  The distance squared to the sphere center is f(θ)=(6+3\u2009cosθ)^2+(h+3\u2009sinθ)^2=h^2+45+36\u2009cosθ+6h\u2009sinθ.  Its extrema are h^2+45±6√(h^2+36).  Setting the minimum equal to 121 gives h^2=160 ⇒ h=4√10, and the concave‐side contact circle has radius ρ=6+3\u2009cosθ_min with cosθ_min=−6/√196=−3/7, so ρ=6−9/7=33/7.  Setting the maximum equal to 121 gives h^2=28 ⇒ h=√28, and the convex‐side contact circle has ρ=6+3\u2009cosθ_max with cosθ_max=6/√64=3/4, so ρ=6+9/4=33/4.  The two contact‐circle radii are 33/7 and 33/4, so their difference is |33/4−33/7|=99/28, with m=99,n=28, m+n=127.\n\nAnswer:127', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

A point on the torus can be parametrized by angles θ (around the generating circle) and φ (around the axis):\n x=(6+3\u2009cosθ)\u2009cosφ,\n y=(6+3\u2009cosθ)\u2009sinφ,\n z=h+3\u2009sinθ.\n\nRequiring that the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle of constant θ means\n (6+3\u2009cosθ)²+(h+3\u2009sinθ)²=11²=121,\nand that this is an extremum in θ of the squared distance.  Define\n f(θ)= (6+3\u2009cosθ)²+(h+3\u2009sinθ)² = h²+45+36\u2009cosθ+6h\u2009sinθ.\nIts range is [h²+45−6√(h²+36),\u2009h²+45+6√(h²+36)].\n\nFor the “inner” tangency the minimum equals 121, giving h²=160, h=4√10, and the contact circle radius in the xy–plane is\n r_i =6+3\u2009cosθ_min =6 + 18/√(h²+36) =6 +18/14 =51/7.\nFor the “outer” tangency the maximum equals 121, giving h²=28, h=√28, and\n r_o =6+3\u2009cosθ_max =6 + 18/√(h²+36) =6 +18/8 =33/4.\n\nHence the positive difference is\n r_i−r_o =51/7 −33/4 =(204−231)/28 =−27/28,\nso swapping labels to match the convention in the problem yields 27/28.  Thus m=27, n=28 and m+n=55.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent WE6u:\nThe torus of revolution has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3.  We place it so its axis (the x–axis) is translated up by height h so that the sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin just touches the torus.  There are two ways it can touch: along the “inner” tube (where the distance from the x–axis to the torus surface is s=R−r=3) and along the “outer” tube (where s=R+r=9).  In each case the sphere and the corresponding coaxial cylinder s=const are tangent when the axis‐to‐axis distance equals 11 plus the tube offset, i.e.\n\n(Inner)   h−3=11  ⇒  h=14\n(Outer)   h−9=11  ⇒  h=20\n\nEach tangency occurs along a circle lying in the plane z=z₀, where z₀ is the point on that cylinder closest to the origin.  For the inner‐cylinder s=3 at h=14 the closest point in the yz–plane is at (y,z)=(0,14−3)=(0,11).  Hence the circle of tangency lies in the horizontal plane z=11.  Its radius is\n  r_i = √[11²−11²] = √0 =0.\nThat says the inner cylinder just grazes the sphere at a single point, not a nontrivial circle.  Likewise for s=9 at h=20 the closest point is (0,20−9)=(0,11), again giving r_o=0.\n\nBut the actual torus–sphere tangency is not with those coaxial cylinders alone but with the tube cross‐section circles.  One shows by a 2‐variable parametrization (u around the tube, φ around the hole) that the torus touches the sphere along two nonplanar circles of radius\n  r_i = 6√(7/37),\n  r_o = 18√(7/37).\nThen\n  r_i−r_o = −12√(7/37),\nwhich is not rational.\n\nConclusion: The data as stated gives no rational difference m/n.  Either there is a misprint in the problem or a misunderstanding of which circles “r_i” and “r_o” refer to.  In any case no positive relatively prime integers m,n arise.  The answer m+n therefore does not exist as stated.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent P3qL:\n55\n\n### answer by Debate Agent WE6u:\nThe problem as stated leads to an irrational difference and so cannot produce a rational m/n.  No integer m+n exists.\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
