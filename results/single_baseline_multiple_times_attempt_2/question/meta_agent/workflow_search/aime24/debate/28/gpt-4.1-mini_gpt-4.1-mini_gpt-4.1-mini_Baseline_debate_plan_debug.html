    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent yjx6:
We have a torus T formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus is a standard torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

The torus T is placed externally tangent to a sphere S of radius 11.

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle. The problem states that there are two such tangencies: one with circle radius r_i and one with circle radius r_o. We are asked to find the difference r_i - r_o in simplest form.

Step 1: Understand the geometry.
The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6. The torus&#39; center circle (the &#39;major circle&#39;) has radius 6. The minor circle radius is 3.

The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is tangent externally to the sphere, their surfaces touch along a circle. Because both are surfaces of revolution with circular symmetry, the tangent circle lies in a horizontal plane.

Step 2: Parameterize the torus.
The torus can be described in 3D coordinates (x,y,z) as:
(x,y,z) = ((6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ, 3 sin θ)
where θ and φ range from 0 to 2π.

Step 3: Consider the sphere centered at the origin with radius 11.
The sphere equation is:
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

Step 4: The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The circle lies at some height z = h, and the torus cross-section at height h is a circle in the xy-plane.

For a fixed z = h, the cross-section of the torus is a circle with center at (0,0) and radius r_t(h) = 6 + 3 cos θ, where θ satisfies 3 sin θ = h.

Since h = 3 sin θ, sin θ = h/3.

Then cos θ = ± sqrt(1 - (h/3)^2) = ± sqrt(1 - h^2/9) = ± sqrt((9 - h^2)/9) = ± sqrt(9 - h^2)/3.

So the radius of the torus cross-section at height h is:
R_t(h) = 6 + 3 cos θ = 6 ± 3 * sqrt(9 - h^2)/3 = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2).

Therefore, the cross-section radius at height h is either 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2) or 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2).

Step 5: Sphere cross-section at height h.
The sphere cross-section at height h is a circle of radius r_s(h) = sqrt(121 - h^2).

Step 6: For the torus and sphere to be tangent along a circle at height h, their cross-sections must be tangent circles in the xy-plane.

So, two circles centered at origin with radii R_t(h) and r_s(h) must be tangent externally (since the torus is outside the sphere, the torus circle radius is greater than the sphere circle radius).

But since both circles are centered at the origin, the only way for them to be tangent is if their radii are equal.

Thus, the tangent circle is at height h where:
R_t(h) = r_s(h).

Substitute:
6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2).

Step 7: Solve for h.
We consider both cases:
Case 1: 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)
Case 2: 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Case 1:
6 + sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Let’s isolate sqrt(121 - h^2):
sqrt(121 - h^2) - sqrt(9 - h^2) = 6

Square both sides:
( sqrt(121 - h^2) - sqrt(9 - h^2) )^2 = 36

Expand:
(121 - h^2) - 2 sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} + (9 - h^2) = 36

Simplify:
130 - 2 h^2 - 2 sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} = 36

Bring terms to one side:
-2 sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} = 36 - 130 + 2 h^2 = -94 + 2 h^2

Divide both sides by -2:
sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} = (94 - 2 h^2)/2 = 47 - h^2

Now square both sides:
(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2) = (47 - h^2)^2

Left side:
(121)(9) - 121 h^2 - 9 h^2 + h^4 = 1089 - 130 h^2 + h^4

Right side:
(47)^2 - 2 * 47 * h^2 + h^4 = 2209 - 94 h^2 + h^4

Set equal:
1089 - 130 h^2 + h^4 = 2209 - 94 h^2 + h^4

Subtract h^4 from both sides:
1089 - 130 h^2 = 2209 - 94 h^2

Bring all terms to one side:
1089 - 130 h^2 - 2209 + 94 h^2 = 0

Simplify:
-1120 - 36 h^2 = 0

So:
-36 h^2 = 1120

h^2 = -1120 / 36 &lt; 0

No real solution.

Case 1 gives no real solution.

Case 2:
6 - sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Isolate sqrt terms:
6 - sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Bring sqrt(9 - h^2) to right:
6 = sqrt(121 - h^2) + sqrt(9 - h^2)

Square both sides:
36 = ( sqrt(121 - h^2) + sqrt(9 - h^2) )^2

Expand:
36 = (121 - h^2) + 2 sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} + (9 - h^2)

Simplify:
36 = 130 - 2 h^2 + 2 sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)}

Bring terms to one side:
2 sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} = 36 - 130 + 2 h^2 = -94 + 2 h^2

Divide both sides by 2:
sqrt{(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2)} = -47 + h^2

Since sqrt(...) ≥ 0, right side must be ≥ 0:
-47 + h^2 ≥ 0 =&gt; h^2 ≥ 47

Now square both sides:
(121 - h^2)(9 - h^2) = (-47 + h^2)^2

Left side:
1089 - 130 h^2 + h^4

Right side:
2209 - 94 h^2 + h^4

Set equal:
1089 - 130 h^2 + h^4 = 2209 - 94 h^2 + h^4

Subtract h^4 from both sides:
1089 - 130 h^2 = 2209 - 94 h^2

Bring terms to one side:
1089 - 130 h^2 - 2209 + 94 h^2 = 0

Simplify:
-1120 - 36 h^2 = 0

So:
-36 h^2 = 1120

h^2 = -1120 / 36 &lt; 0

No real solution.

This seems contradictory, possibly a mistake in algebra.

Step 8: Reconsider the approach.

The torus cross-section radius at height h is 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2).

But the torus cross-section radius must be positive.

Let’s define two radii:
R_outer(h) = 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2)
R_inner(h) = 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2)

At height h, the sphere radius is r_s(h) = sqrt(121 - h^2).

The torus lies outside the sphere, so the torus radius is greater than the sphere radius at the tangent circle.

At the tangent circle, the two radii are equal:
Either R_outer(h) = r_s(h) or R_inner(h) = r_s(h).

Try to solve these equations separately.

Equation 1:
6 + sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Let x = sqrt(9 - h^2), y = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Then:
6 + x = y

Square both sides:
(6 + x)^2 = y^2

36 + 12 x + x^2 = y^2

But y^2 = 121 - h^2, x^2 = 9 - h^2

Substitute:
36 + 12 x + 9 - h^2 = 121 - h^2

Simplify:
45 + 12 x = 121

12 x = 76

x = 76 / 12 = 19 / 3

Recall x = sqrt(9 - h^2) = 19 / 3

But 19/3 ≈ 6.333, and sqrt(9 - h^2) ≤ 3, so this is impossible.

No solution for Equation 1.

Equation 2:
6 - sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Let x = sqrt(9 - h^2), y = sqrt(121 - h^2)

Then:
6 - x = y

Square both sides:
(6 - x)^2 = y^2

36 - 12 x + x^2 = y^2

Substitute y^2 and x^2:
36 - 12 x + 9 - h^2 = 121 - h^2

Simplify:
45 - 12 x = 121

-12 x = 76

x = -76 / 12 = -19 / 3

But x = sqrt(9 - h^2) ≥ 0, so no solution.

Step 9: Since direct equalities do not yield solutions, consider the tangent condition for two circles centered at the origin.

Two circles centered at the origin are tangent if their radii are equal.

But the problem says the torus is tangent along a circle to the sphere, so the circle of tangency lies on the torus surface and the sphere surface.

Alternatively, the torus surface points satisfy:
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + R^2 - r^2)^2 = 4 R^2 (x^2 + y^2)

Given R=6, r=3.

The sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

Step 10: Find the circle of intersection between the torus and the sphere.

Substitute x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121 into the torus equation:
(121 + 36 - 9)^2 = 4 * 36 * (x^2 + y^2)

(148)^2 = 144 (x^2 + y^2)

x^2 + y^2 = (148)^2 / 144 = 21904 / 144 = 152.222...

But x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121, so z^2 = 121 - x^2 - y^2 = 121 - 152.222... = negative, impossible.

So no intersection at this radius.

Step 11: Instead, consider the torus offset from the origin by a distance d in the z-direction (since the torus rests on the sphere).

Let the sphere be centered at origin with radius 11.

Let the torus be centered at (0,0,d).

Then sphere equation: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121

Torus equation (shifted): ((sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2) = 9

The torus is the set of points at distance 3 from a circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane shifted up by d along z.

Step 12: The torus and sphere are tangent along a circle. The circle lies in a plane z = h.

At height z = h, the sphere cross-section radius is sqrt(121 - h^2).

At height z = h, the torus cross-section radius is:
Distance from (0,0,h) to the circle of radius 6 at height d.

The distance from point (x,y,h) to the circle of radius 6 in plane z=d is:
|sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6|^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9

For points on the torus cross-section at height h, the radius in xy-plane is r_t(h) satisfying:
(r_t(h) - 6)^2 + (h - d)^2 = 9

So,
(r_t(h) - 6)^2 = 9 - (h - d)^2

r_t(h) = 6 ± sqrt{9 - (h - d)^2}

Step 13: For the torus and sphere to be tangent along a circle at height h, the sphere radius and torus cross-section radius must be equal:

sqrt{121 - h^2} = 6 ± sqrt{9 - (h - d)^2}

Step 14: The problem states the torus rests on the sphere, so the torus is tangent externally to the sphere at two positions: one with circle radius r_i and one with circle radius r_o.

These correspond to the two choices of ± in the above equation.

We want r_i - r_o = difference of the radii of the circles of tangency.

Step 15: To find d and the values of h, note that when the torus rests on the sphere, the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, so the minimal distance between their centers is R + r, where R and r are radii of sphere and torus.

However, the torus is not a sphere but a surface generated by revolving a circle.

Step 16: The centers of the torus&#39; generating circle lie on a circle of radius 6 in the plane z=d.

The sphere is centered at origin.

The minimal distance between the sphere center and the torus&#39; center circle is d (vertical distance).

Step 17: The distance between the sphere center and the torus surface is:
Distance from origin to center circle minus minor radius 3.

The sphere radius is 11.

For external tangency, the distance from origin to the center circle minus 3 equals 11.

So:
d - 3 = 11 =&gt; d = 14.

Step 18: Now, at height h, the torus cross-section radius is:
r_t(h) = 6 ± sqrt{9 - (h - 14)^2}

Sphere cross-section radius is:
r_s(h) = sqrt{121 - h^2}

At tangency:
r_s(h) = r_t(h)

So:
sqrt{121 - h^2} = 6 ± sqrt{9 - (h - 14)^2}

Step 19: Solve for h for both ± cases.

Case +:
sqrt{121 - h^2} = 6 + sqrt{9 - (h - 14)^2}

Case -:
sqrt{121 - h^2} = 6 - sqrt{9 - (h - 14)^2}

Step 20: Consider domain of sqrt{9 - (h - 14)^2} ≥ 0

So |h - 14| ≤ 3 =&gt; h ∈ [11,17]

Also, sqrt{121 - h^2} ≥ 0 =&gt; h^2 ≤ 121 =&gt; h ∈ [-11,11]

Intersection of domains is h ∈ [11,11], i.e., h=11.

Step 21: At h=11, check values:
sqrt{121 - 11^2} = sqrt{121 - 121} = 0

sqrt{9 - (11 -14)^2} = sqrt{9 - 9} = 0

So:
Case +: 0 = 6 + 0 = 6 (false)
Case -: 0 = 6 - 0 = 6 (false)

No solution at h=11.

Step 22: Since domains do not overlap, the equality cannot hold.

Step 23: Reconsider the problem: the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o. These radii are the radii of the tangent circle on the torus.

From the torus geometry, the radii of the tangent circles are R ± r = 6 ± 3 = 9 and 3.

Step 24: The sphere radius is 11.

If the torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along the circle of radius 9, then the distance between centers is 11 + 3 = 14.

If the torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along the circle of radius 3, then the distance between centers is 11 - 3 = 8.

Step 25: The difference r_i - r_o is the difference between the radii of the tangent circles, which is 9 - 3 = 6.

Step 26: However, the problem states the difference can be expressed as m/n with m,n relatively prime positive integers and asks for m + n.

6 = 6/1, so m=6, n=1, m + n = 7.

Therefore, the answer is 7.

### thinking by Debate Agent bRs7:
The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This creates a torus with a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

The sphere S has radius 11.

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus at some cross-section. The torus can be thought of as a set of circles of radius 3 centered on a circle of radius 6.

The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i in one position and radius r_o in another position. The problem states that the torus rests on the outside of the sphere in two different ways, producing two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.

We want to find r_i - r_o.

Step 1: Understand the geometry.
- The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis, the center of the circle moves on a circle of radius 6.
- The torus is defined by points at distance 3 from the circle of radius 6.

Step 2: The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.

Step 3: When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the distance between the center of the sphere and the center of the torus circle (the circle that generates the torus) must be such that the torus just touches the sphere.

Step 4: The circle of tangency on the torus is a circle parallel to the axis of revolution, at some angle.

Step 5: The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus can be expressed in terms of the angle parameter.

Step 6: The torus is the set of points at distance 3 from the circle of radius 6.

Step 7: The sphere center is at the origin. The torus circle center moves on a circle of radius 6.

Step 8: The torus can be represented parametrically as:
(x, y, z) = ((6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ, 3 sin θ)

Step 9: The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.

Step 10: The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin to the torus surface is 11.

Step 11: The distance from the origin to a point on the torus is:
D(θ, φ) = sqrt(((6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ)^2 + ((6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2)
= sqrt((6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2)
= sqrt((6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin^2 θ)

Step 12: Simplify inside the square root:
(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin^2 θ = 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos^2 θ + 9 sin^2 θ
Since cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ = 1, this is:
36 + 36 cos θ + 9 * 1 = 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 = 45 + 36 cos θ

Step 13: So the distance from the origin to the torus surface at angle θ is:
D(θ) = sqrt(45 + 36 cos θ)

Step 14: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere of radius 11, the distance from the origin to the torus surface must be equal to 11.

So:
D(θ) = 11
=&gt; sqrt(45 + 36 cos θ) = 11
=&gt; 45 + 36 cos θ = 121
=&gt; 36 cos θ = 121 - 45 = 76
=&gt; cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9

Step 15: But cos θ cannot be greater than 1, so this is impossible.

Step 16: This suggests that the torus is not tangent to the sphere at the outer surface of the minor circle but at the inner surface.

Step 17: The torus surface is at distance D(θ) = sqrt(45 + 36 cos θ), so the maximum distance from the origin to the torus surface is when cos θ = 1:
D_max = sqrt(45 + 36 * 1) = sqrt(81) = 9

Step 18: The minimum distance is when cos θ = -1:
D_min = sqrt(45 - 36) = sqrt(9) = 3

Step 19: So the torus lies between distances 3 and 9 from the origin, but the sphere has radius 11, which is outside this range.

Step 20: This means the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere if the sphere is centered at the origin.

Step 21: The problem states the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, meaning the sphere is not centered at the origin but the torus is placed so that it is tangent externally.

Step 22: Let&#39;s consider the sphere fixed at the origin with radius 11, and the torus placed so that the axis of revolution is at a distance d from the origin.

Step 23: The torus is generated by revolving a circle radius 3 around an axis at distance 6 from the center of the circle.

Step 24: The torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Step 25: The torus is placed so that its axis is parallel to the z-axis, and the center of the torus circle is at a distance d from the origin along the x-axis.

Step 26: The distance from the origin to the center of the torus circle is d.

Step 27: The torus is tangent to the sphere if the sphere of radius 11 is tangent externally to the torus.

Step 28: The torus surface at a given angle θ has distance from the torus center circle:
Distance from torus center circle: r = 3

Step 29: The distance from the origin to a point on the torus surface is:
D = sqrt(d^2 + R^2 + r^2 + 2 R r cos θ) (by the law of cosines in the plane of the torus cross-section)

Step 30: Wait, this is complicated. Let&#39;s change approach.

Step 31: The torus can be thought of as the set of points at distance r = 3 from the circle of radius R = 6 centered at some point on the x-axis at distance d from the origin.

Step 32: The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.

Step 33: The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle. The circle of tangency lies on the torus at some angle θ.

Step 34: The distance from the origin to the center of the circle generating the torus is d.

Step 35: The distance from the origin to a point on the torus surface is:
Distance = sqrt((d + R cos φ + r cos θ cos φ)^2 + (R sin φ + r cos θ sin φ)^2 + (r sin θ)^2)

Step 36: But the torus is symmetric about the axis, so the distance to the origin depends only on θ and d.

Step 37: The minimum and maximum distances from the origin to the torus surface are d - (R + r) and d + (R + r) along the axis.

Step 38: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere externally, the sphere radius 11 must be equal to the minimum or maximum distance from the origin to the torus surface.

Step 39: So, the torus rests on the sphere with the torus axis at distance d from the origin, and the sphere radius is 11.

Step 40: The torus has an inner radius (distance from axis to inner edge) = R - r = 3
The torus has an outer radius (distance from axis to outer edge) = R + r = 9

Step 41: The torus is tangent to the sphere of radius 11, so the distance from the origin to the torus axis is either 11 - 9 = 2 (torus outer edge touches sphere) or 11 - 3 = 8 (torus inner edge touches sphere).

Step 42: So the two positions correspond to d = 2 and d = 8.

Step 43: The circle of tangency lies on the torus at some radius r_i or r_o.

Step 44: The circle of tangency radius is the radius of the circle on the torus where it touches the sphere.

Step 45: The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is given by the radius of the circle formed by the cross-section at the angle θ where the torus touches the sphere.

Step 46: The radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the circle of revolution on the torus at height corresponding to θ.

Step 47: The radius of the circle of revolution is R + r cos θ.

Step 48: At the two positions, the torus is tangent to the sphere at the inner and outer edges:
- For d = 2, the torus outer edge touches the sphere.
- For d = 8, the torus inner edge touches the sphere.

Step 49: Let&#39;s find the circle radius r_i and r_o for these two cases.

Step 50: The radius of the circle of tangency is R + r cos θ.

Step 51: At the outer edge, cos θ = 1 =&gt; radius = R + r = 9
At the inner edge, cos θ = -1 =&gt; radius = R - r = 3

Step 52: The torus is tangent to the sphere at these two positions, so the radii of the circles of tangency are 9 and 3.

Step 53: The problem states r_i and r_o correspond to these two radii.

Step 54: The difference r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6.

Step 55: The problem wants the answer in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

Step 56: 6 can be written as 6/1, so m = 6 and n = 1.

Step 57: Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.

    <pre>The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle at a distance 6 from the center, giving a major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus at some cross-section. The torus surface points are at distance between R - r = 3 and R + r = 9 from the torus axis. For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin, the distance from the sphere center to the torus axis must be either 11 - 9 = 2 or 11 - 3 = 8. These correspond to the torus touching the sphere at the outer edge (circle radius 9) or inner edge (circle radius 3) of the generating circle. Thus, the two tangent circles have radii r_i = 9 and r_o = 3. The difference r_i - r_o = 6, which can be expressed as 6/1, so m=6, n=1, and m+n=7.
