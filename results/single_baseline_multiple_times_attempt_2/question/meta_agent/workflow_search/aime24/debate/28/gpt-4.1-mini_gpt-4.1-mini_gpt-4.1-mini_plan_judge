Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle at a distance 6 from the center, giving a major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus at some cross-section. The torus surface points are at distance between R - r = 3 and R + r = 9 from the torus axis. For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin, the distance from the sphere center to the torus axis must be either 11 - 9 = 2 or 11 - 3 = 8. These correspond to the torus touching the sphere at the outer edge (circle radius 9) or inner edge (circle radius 3) of the generating circle. Thus, the two tangent circles have radii r_i = 9 and r_o = 3. The difference r_i - r_o = 6, which can be expressed as 6/1, so m=6, n=1, and m+n=7.
