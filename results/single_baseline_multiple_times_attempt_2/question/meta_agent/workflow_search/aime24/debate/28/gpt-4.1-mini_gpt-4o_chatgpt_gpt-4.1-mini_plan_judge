Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere both internally and externally, and then determine the difference between these radii. The torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus inside the sphere, the center of the torus is at a distance R - r = 6 - 3 = 3 from the center of the sphere. The sphere's radius is 11, so the distance from the sphere's center to the circle of tangency is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency is r_i = 3. For the torus outside the sphere, the center of the torus is at a distance R + r = 6 + 3 = 9 from the center of the sphere. The sphere's radius is 11, so the distance from the sphere's center to the circle of tangency is 11 + 9 = 20. The radius of the circle of tangency is r_o = 9. The difference r_i - r_o = 3 - 9 = -6. However, the problem asks for the difference when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_o and internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. The correct setup is r_i = 2 and r_o = 14, so the difference is 14 - 2 = 12. This difference can be expressed as 12/1, thus m = 12 and n = 1. Therefore, m+n = 13.
