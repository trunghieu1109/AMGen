    <pre>Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

### thinking by Debate Agent G8rn:
We want the number of nonempty finite sets B of positive integers whose maximum lies in A. For each a in A, the number of B with max(B)=a is the number of subsets of {1,…,a−1}, namely 2^{a−1}. Hence we need Σ_{a∈A}2^{a−1}=2024. Writing 2024 in binary gives 11111101000₂=2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Thus the exponents a−1 are {10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}, whose sum is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.

### thinking by Debate Agent yq17:
We need the set A of positive integers so that sum over m in A of 2^{m-1} =2024.  Since each exponent 2^{m-1} appears once (distinct m), representing 2024 in binary gives 2024=2^{10}+2^{9}+2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{5}+2^{3}.  Thus A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}, and the sum of its elements is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.
