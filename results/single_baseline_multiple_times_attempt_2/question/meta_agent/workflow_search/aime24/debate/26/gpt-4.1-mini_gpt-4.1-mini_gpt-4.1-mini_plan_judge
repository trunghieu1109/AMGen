Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: The problem states that Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. For each element m in A, the number of such sets B with max(B) = m is the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m} containing m, which is 2^(m-1). Since these sets are disjoint for different m, the total number of sets is sum_{m in A} 2^(m-1) = 2024. We need to find the set A and then sum its elements. 

Express 2024 as a sum of powers of two: 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2^{10} + 2^{9} + 2^{8} + 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{5} + 2^{3}. 

Since each term corresponds to 2^{m-1}, the exponents correspond to m-1, so m in A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}. 

Sum of elements in A = 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55.
