Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Let AC be the base of triangle ABC of length L.  Along AC we place N circles of radius r, each tangent to AC and to its neighbors, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last to BC.  A standard result shows that
   L = r[cot(A/2) + cot(C/2) + 2(N−1)].
Using (N,r)=(8,34) gives L=34(s+14), and (2024,1) gives L=s+4046, where s=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2).  Equating:  34(s+14)=s+4046 ⇒33s=3570 ⇒s=1190/11.  Then L=s+4046=(1190/11)+4046=45696/11.
In any triangle, cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=b/r_in where b=AC.  Hence r_in = b / s = (45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5.  Thus m+n=192+5=197.
