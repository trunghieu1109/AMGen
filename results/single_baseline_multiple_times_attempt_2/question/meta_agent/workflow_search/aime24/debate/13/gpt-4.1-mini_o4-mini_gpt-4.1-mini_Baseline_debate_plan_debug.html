    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent Dcwu:
We interpret the problem as placing N congruent circles along side AC of triangle ABC, each tangent to base AC, successive circles tangent to each other, the first tangent to AB and the last to BC.  For circles of radius r sitting on AC, the x‐coordinates of their centers satisfy x1=r cot(α/2), xN=L−r cot(γ/2), and adjacent centers are 2r apart, giving

L = r[cot(α/2)+cot(γ/2) + 2(N−1)].

Since the same triangle accommodates N1=8 circles of radius R=34 and N2=2024 circles of radius r=1, we have:

34[c1+c2 +2·7] = c1+c2 +2·2023  where c1=cot(α/2), c2=cot(γ/2).

So 34(c+14)=c+4046 ⇒33c=3570 ⇒c=c1+c2=1190/11.

Also AC=L =1[c+2·2023] = c+4046 = (1190/11)+4046 =45696/11.

In any triangle, cot(A/2)+cot(C/2) = (AC)/r_in, so r_in = AC/(c1+c2) = (45696/11)/(1190/11) =45696/1190 =192/5.

Hence m+n=192+5=197.

### thinking by Debate Agent B4RK:
We unfold the chain of circles between the two sides and derive a linear relation between the circle radius r and the number of circles N of the form r = a N + b.  Plugging in (N, r) = (8, 34) and (2024, 1) gives a = -11/672 and b = 2867/84.  The inradius of the triangle corresponds exactly to the constant term b, so r_in = 2867/84 in lowest terms.  Hence m + n = 2867 + 84 = 2951.

    <pre>Let AC be the base of triangle ABC of length L.  Along AC we place N circles of radius r, each tangent to AC and to its neighbors, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last to BC.  A standard result shows that
   L = r[cot(A/2) + cot(C/2) + 2(N−1)].
Using (N,r)=(8,34) gives L=34(s+14), and (2024,1) gives L=s+4046, where s=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2).  Equating:  34(s+14)=s+4046 ⇒33s=3570 ⇒s=1190/11.  Then L=s+4046=(1190/11)+4046=45696/11.
In any triangle, cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=b/r_in where b=AC.  Hence r_in = b / s = (45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5.  Thus m+n=192+5=197.
