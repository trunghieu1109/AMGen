Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SrOH', content='We have two equations: log_x(y^x)=10 gives x*(log y)/(log x)=10 ⇒ (log y)/(log x)=10/x. And log_y(x^{4y})=10 gives 4y*(log x)/(log y)=10 ⇒ (log x)/(log y)=5/(2y) ⇒ (log y)/(log x)=2y/5. Equate 10/x=2y/5 ⇒50=2xy ⇒xy=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
