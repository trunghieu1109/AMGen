Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two equations: log_x(y^x)=10 gives x*(log y)/(log x)=10 ⇒ (log y)/(log x)=10/x. And log_y(x^{4y})=10 gives 4y*(log x)/(log y)=10 ⇒ (log x)/(log y)=5/(2y) ⇒ (log y)/(log x)=2y/5. Equate 10/x=2y/5 ⇒50=2xy ⇒xy=25.
