proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We need to find the product \( xy \).

First, consider the equation \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This implies:
\[ y^x = x^{10}. \]

Next, consider the equation \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). This implies:
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10}. \]

We have the system of equations:
1. \( y^x = x^{10} \)
2. \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \)

From the first equation, \( y^x = x^{10} \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = x^{10/x}. \]

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into the second equation:
\[ x^{4y} = (x^{10/x})^{10}. \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ x^{4y} = x^{100/x}. \]

Equating the exponents from both sides:
\[ 4y = \frac{100}{x}. \]

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into \( 4y = \frac{100}{x} \):
\[ 4x^{10/x} = \frac{100}{x}. \]

Multiply both sides by \( x \):
\[ 4x^{1 + 10/x} = 100. \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x^{1 + 10/x} = 25. \]

Let \( z = 1 + \frac{10}{x} \). Then \( x^z = 25 \), so \( x = 25^{1/z} \).

Substitute back to find \( y \):
\[ y = x^{10/x} = (25^{1/z})^{10/x}. \]

Now, solve for \( z \):
\[ 1 + \frac{10}{x} = 2 \] (since \( 25 = 5^2 \) and \( x^z = 5^2 \)).

Thus, \( \frac{10}{x} = 1 \), so \( x = 10 \).

Substitute \( x = 10 \) back to find \( y \):
\[ y = 10^{10/10} = 10. \]

Finally, the product \( xy = 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
