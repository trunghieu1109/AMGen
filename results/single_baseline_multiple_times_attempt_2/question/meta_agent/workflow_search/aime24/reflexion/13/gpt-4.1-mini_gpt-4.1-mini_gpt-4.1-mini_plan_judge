Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Let the angle at vertex B be 2θ. The circles are tangent to sides AB and BC and tangent to each other, arranged along the angle bisector of angle B. The centers of the circles lie on the angle bisector, and the distance from the center of each circle to each side is equal to the radius r of the circle.

For a circle tangent to both sides of an angle 2θ, the distance from the center to each side is r, and the center lies on the angle bisector. The distance from the vertex B to the center of the first circle is d_1 = r / sin(θ).

Since the circles are tangent to each other, the centers are spaced by 2r along the angle bisector. So the distance from B to the center of the nth circle is:

  d_n = d_1 + 2r(n-1) = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1)

The last circle is tangent to side BC, so the distance from B to the center of the last circle plus the radius r equals the length along the bisector to the side BC. But since the circles are tangent to both sides, the chain of circles fits exactly between the sides.

Given that 8 circles of radius 34 fit, and 2024 circles of radius 1 fit, the total length along the bisector from B to the last circle's center plus radius is the same in both cases:

  L = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r

Simplify:

  L = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r

But the last term r is the radius, so total length along bisector to the far side is:

  L = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r

Actually, the last circle is tangent to side BC, so the distance from B to side BC along the bisector is equal to the distance from B to the center of the last circle plus r.

Therefore, the total length along the bisector from B to the side BC is:

  D = d_n + r = (r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1)) + r = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r

Simplify:

  D = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r

Group terms:

  D = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r = r / sin(θ) + 2r(n-1) + r

Note that 2r(n-1) + r = r(2n - 1), so:

  D = r / sin(θ) + r(2n - 1) = r(1 / sin(θ) + 2n - 1)

Since the triangle ABC is fixed, D is the same for both arrangements:

For the first arrangement (r=34, n=8):

  D = 34 (1 / sin(θ) + 2*8 - 1) = 34 (1 / sin(θ) + 15)

For the second arrangement (r=1, n=2024):

  D = 1 (1 / sin(θ) + 2*2024 - 1) = 1 (1 / sin(θ) + 4047)

Set equal:

  34 (1 / sin(θ) + 15) = 1 / sin(θ) + 4047

Multiply out:

  34 / sin(θ) + 510 = 1 / sin(θ) + 4047

Bring terms to one side:

  34 / sin(θ) - 1 / sin(θ) = 4047 - 510

  (33) / sin(θ) = 3537

So:

  1 / sin(θ) = 3537 / 33 = 107.181818...

Therefore:

  sin(θ) = 33 / 3537 = 11 / 1179

Now, the inradius r_in of triangle ABC is related to the angle at B and the distance D. The inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle tangent to all three sides.

The inradius can be expressed as:

  r_in = D * sin(θ)

Using D from the second arrangement:

  D = 1 / sin(θ) + 4047 = 107.181818... + 4047 = 4154.181818...

But better to keep exact:

  D = (1 / sin(θ)) + 4047 = (3537 / 33) + 4047 = (3537 + 4047*33) / 33

Calculate numerator:

  4047 * 33 = 133551

So numerator:

  3537 + 133551 = 137088

Therefore:

  D = 137088 / 33

Then:

  r_in = D * sin(θ) = (137088 / 33) * (11 / 1179) = (137088 * 11) / (33 * 1179)

Calculate denominator:

  33 * 1179 = 38907

Calculate numerator:

  137088 * 11 = 1507968

So:

  r_in = 1507968 / 38907

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 3:

  1507968 / 3 = 502656

  38907 / 3 = 12969

So:

  r_in = 502656 / 12969

Check if divisible further:

  502656 / 12969

Try dividing numerator and denominator by 3 again:

  502656 / 3 = 167552

  12969 / 3 = 4323

So:

  r_in = 167552 / 4323

Check gcd(167552, 4323):

  4323 factors: 3 * 3 * 13 * 37

  167552 is even, so no common factors with 3 or 13 or 37.

So fraction is in lowest terms.

Therefore, the inradius is r_in = 167552 / 4323.

Finally, m + n = 167552 + 4323 = 171875.
