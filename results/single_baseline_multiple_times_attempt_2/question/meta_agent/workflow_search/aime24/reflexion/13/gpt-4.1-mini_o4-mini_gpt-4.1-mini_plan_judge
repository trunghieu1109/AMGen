Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: After re‐interpreting the chain as sitting on AC and chaining between AB and BC, one finds
  L – r·cot A – r·cot C = 2r(N–1).
Equating for (r,N)=(34,8) and (1,2024) gives cot A+cot C = 1190/11 and AC =45696/11.  Placing A=(0,0), C=(AC,0), B where the two sides meet, one computes its y–coordinate (the altitude) y_B = AC/(cot A+cot C) = (45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=22848/595=1344/35.  Taking that as the inradius R yields R=1344/35, so m+n=1344+35=1379.
