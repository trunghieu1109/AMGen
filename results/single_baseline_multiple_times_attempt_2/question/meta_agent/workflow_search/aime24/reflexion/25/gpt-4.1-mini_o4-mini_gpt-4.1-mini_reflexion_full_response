Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent n16Y', content='We model the equilateral hexagon by consecutive side‐vectors v1,v2,v3,v4=−v1,v5=−v2,v6=−v3 of common length s.  One checks that the three lines AB (direction v1 through A), CD (direction v3 through C=v1+v2), EF (direction v2 through F=v3) form a triangle whose side‐lengths in terms of the parameters p,q defined by v3=pv1+qv2 are\n L1 = s·(p + p/q − 1),\n L2 = s·((pq + p − q)/(pq)),\n L3 = s·(q + 1 − q/p).\n Matching these to 200,300,240 (in the only order giving positive p,q), one finds q=4/5, p=2/3, and s=400.\n\nAnswer:400', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
