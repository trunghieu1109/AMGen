Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is not equilateral, but its sides are proportional to the side length of the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300, which are in a 5:6:7 ratio. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the side length of the hexagon is the common factor that scales the equilateral hexagon to the given triangle. The side length of the hexagon is the greatest common divisor of the side lengths of the triangle, which is 20.
