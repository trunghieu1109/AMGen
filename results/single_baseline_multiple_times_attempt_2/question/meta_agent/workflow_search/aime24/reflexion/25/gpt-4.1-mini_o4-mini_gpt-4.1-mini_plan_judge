Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We model the equilateral hexagon by consecutive side‐vectors v1,v2,v3,v4=−v1,v5=−v2,v6=−v3 of common length s.  One checks that the three lines AB (direction v1 through A), CD (direction v3 through C=v1+v2), EF (direction v2 through F=v3) form a triangle whose side‐lengths in terms of the parameters p,q defined by v3=pv1+qv2 are
 L1 = s·(p + p/q − 1),
 L2 = s·((pq + p − q)/(pq)),
 L3 = s·(q + 1 − q/p).
 Matching these to 200,300,240 (in the only order giving positive p,q), one finds q=4/5, p=2/3, and s=400.
