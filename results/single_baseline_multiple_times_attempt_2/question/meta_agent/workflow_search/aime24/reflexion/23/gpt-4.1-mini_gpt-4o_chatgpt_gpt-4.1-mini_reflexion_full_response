Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]\Pattern: reflexion

The problem requires finding all possible digit placements in a 2x3 grid that satisfy the given conditions. The solution should involve systematically checking possible values for the numbers formed by reading left to right and ensuring the vertical sums also match the required total. The answer '4' seems to be an underestimation of the possible combinations.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better."}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
