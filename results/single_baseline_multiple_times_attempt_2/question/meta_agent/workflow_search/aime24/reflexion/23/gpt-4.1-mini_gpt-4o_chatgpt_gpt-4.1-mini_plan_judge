Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The conditions are: \(abc + def = 999\) and \(ad + be + cf = 99\). We need to find all possible combinations of digits that satisfy these conditions. We can start by considering possible values for \(abc\) and \(def\) such that their sum is 999. Then, for each pair, we check if the vertical sums \(ad + be + cf = 99\).
