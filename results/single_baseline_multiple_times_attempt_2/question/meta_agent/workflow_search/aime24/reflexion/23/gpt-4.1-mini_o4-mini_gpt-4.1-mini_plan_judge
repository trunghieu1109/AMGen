Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Let the grid entries be a,b,c in the first row and d,e,f in the second. Reading rows gives numbers 100a+10b+c and 100d+10e+f, whose sum is 999, so 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999 ⇒ a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. Reading columns gives 2-digit numbers 10a+d,10b+e,10c+f; their sum is 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99 ⇒ 10S1+S2=99 where S1=a+b+c, S2=d+e+f. But S2=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)−S1=27−S1, so 10S1+(27−S1)=99 ⇒9S1=72 ⇒S1=8. Thus choose nonnegative a,b,c with a+b+c=8 (and automatically a≤9), and then set d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c. The number of solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
