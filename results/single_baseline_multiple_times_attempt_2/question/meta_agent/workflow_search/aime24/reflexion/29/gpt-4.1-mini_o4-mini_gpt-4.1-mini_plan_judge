Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need maximal placements: each row and column has uniform chip color, and no empty cell can accept any chip. Label rows (Ri) and columns (Cj) as W or B. Place chips exactly where Ri=Cj. Maximality forces that for each color X, either both the number of X‐rows and X‐columns are zero, or both are positive. Thus valid pairs (W_r,W_c) are (0,0),(5,5) or 1≤W_r,W_c≤4. Counting gives 1 + 1 + (2^5–2)^2 = 2 + 30^2 = 902.
