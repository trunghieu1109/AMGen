    <pre>We have a 5x5 grid with 25 cells. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable within their color. We want to place some chips on the grid such that:

1. Each cell contains at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row have the same color.
3. All chips in the same column have the same color.
4. The placement is maximal: adding any additional chip would violate one or more of the above conditions.

Step 1: Understand the color constraints per row and column.
- Since all chips in the same row have the same color, each row is either all white chips or all black chips (or empty).
- Since all chips in the same column have the same color, each column is either all white chips or all black chips (or empty).

Step 2: Consider the intersection of row and column colors.
- If a row is colored white, then all chips in that row are white.
- If a column is colored black, then all chips in that column are black.
- For a cell at the intersection of a white row and a black column, what color chip can be placed? It must be both white (from the row) and black (from the column), which is impossible.
- Therefore, a chip can be placed in a cell only if the row and column colors agree.

Step 3: Maximality condition.
- We want to place chips so that adding any chip would violate the conditions.
- This means that for any empty cell, placing a chip would break the color consistency.

Step 4: Assign colors to rows and columns.
- Each row is assigned a color: white or black.
- Each column is assigned a color: white or black.

Step 5: Determine which cells can have chips.
- A cell (i,j) can have a chip if and only if the color of row i equals the color of column j.

Step 6: Maximality implies that all such cells must be filled.
- Because if any such cell is empty, we could add a chip there without violating the conditions.
- So all cells where row color = column color must be occupied.

Step 7: Count the number of chips placed.
- Let r_w = number of white rows
- r_b = number of black rows = 5 - r_w
- c_w = number of white columns
- c_b = number of black columns = 5 - c_w

- Number of white chips placed = r_w * c_w
- Number of black chips placed = r_b * c_b

Step 8: Check chip availability.
- We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips.
- So r_w * c_w &lt;= 25 and r_b * c_b &lt;= 25, which is always true since max is 5*5=25.

Step 9: Count the number of valid configurations.
- We need to count the number of ways to assign colors to rows and columns.
- Each row can be white or black independently: 2^5 ways
- Each column can be white or black independently: 2^5 ways
- Total assignments: 2^5 * 2^5 = 2^{10} = 1024

Step 10: Exclude the trivial case where all rows and columns are black or all are white.
- If all rows and columns are white, then all cells are white, so all 25 white chips are placed.
- Similarly for all black.
- These are valid.

Step 11: Check maximality.
- For maximality, all cells where row color = column color must be filled.
- So the configuration is determined by the color assignments.

Step 12: Final answer.
- The number of ways is the number of ways to assign colors to rows and columns: 1024.

Therefore, the answer is 1024.
