    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Fvze (yourself):
We need maximal placements of indistinguishable white/black chips on a 5×5 grid so that each row’s chips are all one colour and each column’s all one colour, and no empty cell can accept a chip without violating uniformity.

Label each row colour R_i∈{W,B} and each column C_j∈{W,B}.  In order to be maximal, every intersection with R_i=C_j must be occupied, and every empty cell has R_i≠C_j so adding any chip breaks a row or column constraint.  Moreover, no row or column can be empty: if any row of colour X existed but there were no columns of colour X, that row would have no chips.  Similarly for columns.  Thus the counts of white rows w and white columns x must satisfy either both are 0 (all rows/columns black giving a full black grid), both are 5 (all white giving full white), or both in 1…4.  The number of choices is
  – (w,x)=(0,0): C(5,0)·C(5,0)=1
  – (w,x)=(5,5): 1·1=1
  – w=1..4 and x=1..4: ∑₁⁴C(5,w)·∑₁⁴C(5,x)=30·30=900.
Total =1+1+900=902.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Fvze (yourself):
902

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Htwh:
The solution incorrectly omits the cases where exactly one of the numbers of white rows or white columns is 0 or 5. In fact every choice of a subset of rows and a subset of columns (2^5·2^5=1024 possibilities) yields a maximal placement, but the empty placement is counted twice, giving 1023 distinct patterns.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We need maximal placements: each row and column has uniform chip color, and no empty cell can accept any chip. Label rows (Ri) and columns (Cj) as W or B. Place chips exactly where Ri=Cj. Maximality forces that for each color X, either both the number of X‐rows and X‐columns are zero, or both are positive. Thus valid pairs (W_r,W_c) are (0,0),(5,5) or 1≤W_r,W_c≤4. Counting gives 1 + 1 + (2^5–2)^2 = 2 + 30^2 = 902.
