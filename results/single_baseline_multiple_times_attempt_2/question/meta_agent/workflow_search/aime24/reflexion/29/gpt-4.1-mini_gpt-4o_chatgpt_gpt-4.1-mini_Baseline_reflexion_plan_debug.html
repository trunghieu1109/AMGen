    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that each row and each column can either be entirely filled with white chips or entirely filled with black chips, but not a mix of both. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose any number of rows to be filled with white chips, and the remaining rows will be filled with black chips. Similarly, we can choose any number of columns to be filled with white chips, and the remaining columns will be filled with black chips. However, the number of white rows must equal the number of white columns, and the number of black rows must equal the number of black columns, because otherwise, we would not be able to fill the grid completely with the given number of chips. Therefore, if we choose k rows to be white, we must also choose k columns to be white, and the remaining 5-k rows and 5-k columns will be black. The number of ways to choose k rows to be white is \( \binom{5}{k} \), and the number of ways to choose k columns to be white is also \( \binom{5}{k} \). Thus, the total number of ways to fill the grid is the sum of \( \binom{5}{k}^2 \) for k from 0 to 5.
