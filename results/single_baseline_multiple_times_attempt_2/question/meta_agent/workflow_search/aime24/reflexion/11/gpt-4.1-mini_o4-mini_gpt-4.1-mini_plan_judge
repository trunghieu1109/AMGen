Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 E and 8 N steps (total 16), that change direction exactly 4 times. A change count of 4 means the path has 5 runs (maximal consecutive steps in one direction). Runs must alternate E and N, so the pattern is either E–N–E–N–E (3 E‐runs, 2 N‐runs) or N–E–N–E–N (3 N‐runs, 2 E‐runs).

Case 1: pattern E,N,E,N,E. Let the E‐run lengths be positive integers e1+e2+e3=8 and the N‐run lengths be n1+n2=8, all ≥1. The number of positive solutions for e’s is (8−1 choose 3−1) = (7 choose 2) = 21; for n’s is (8−1 choose 2−1) = (7 choose 1) = 7. So 21·7 = 147 paths.

Case 2: pattern N,E,N,E,N. Similarly, positive n1+n2+n3=8 gives (7 choose 2)=21; e1+e2=8 gives (7 choose 1)=7; again 21·7 = 147.

Total = 147 + 147 = 294.
