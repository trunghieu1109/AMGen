Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: To find the number of paths with exactly four changes in direction, we divide the path into five segments: R, U, R, U, R (or U, R, U, R, U). Each segment consists of only R's or only U's. We need to partition the 8 R's into three parts and the 8 U's into two parts. The number of ways to partition 8 R's into three parts is given by C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7, 2). The number of ways to partition 8 U's into two parts is given by C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7, 1). We multiply these results by 2 to account for the two possible starting directions (R or U).
