    <pre>We are considering paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps right (R) and 8 steps up (U). We want to count the number of such paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change in direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. Since the path has 16 steps, and exactly 4 changes in direction, the path can be divided into 5 segments (because the number of segments is one more than the number of changes). Each segment consists of steps all in the same direction, alternating between R and U. The path must start with either R or U, and then alternate directions 4 times, resulting in 5 segments total. Let the lengths of these 5 segments be a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. The directions alternate, so if the first segment is R, then the second is U, the third is R, the fourth is U, and the fifth is R. Similarly, if the first segment is U, then the second is R, the third is U, the fourth is R, and the fifth is U. Since the total number of R steps is 8 and total U steps is 8, we have two cases: Case 1: Start with R. Then the R segments are a1, a3, a5 and the U segments are a2, a4. So a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 and a2 + a4 = 8. Case 2: Start with U. Then the U segments are a1, a3, a5 and the R segments are a2, a4. So a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 and a2 + a4 = 8. Each segment length is at least 1 because a segment of length 0 would mean no steps in that direction, which is not a change in direction. So we want the number of positive integer solutions to these equations. For Case 1: Number of positive integer solutions to a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Number of positive integer solutions to a2 + a4 = 8 is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So total for Case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147. For Case 2: Similarly, number of positive integer solutions to a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 is 21, and for a2 + a4 = 8 is 7. So total for Case 2 is also 147. Total number of paths with exactly 4 changes in direction is 147 + 147 = 294.
