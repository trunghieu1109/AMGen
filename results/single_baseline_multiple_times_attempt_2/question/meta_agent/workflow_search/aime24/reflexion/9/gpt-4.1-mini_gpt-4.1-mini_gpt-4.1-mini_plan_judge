Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from the same set.

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers.

We want P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(all 4 match) / P(at least 2 match).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways for Jen to pick her 4 numbers: also 210, but fixed since Jen has chosen her 4 numbers.

Step 3: Probability that the lottery's 4 numbers exactly match Jen's 4 numbers (grand prize):
Only 1 way (the exact 4 Jen chose) out of 210.

So P(grand prize) = 1/210.

Step 4: Calculate P(at least 2 match).

Let k = number of matches between Jen's 4 numbers and the lottery's 4 numbers.

k can be 0,1,2,3,4.

We want P(k >= 2).

Number of ways for the lottery to pick 4 numbers with exactly k matches with Jen's 4 numbers:
- Choose k numbers from Jen's 4 numbers: C(4,k)
- Choose (4-k) numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since total 10 - 4 Jen's numbers = 6): C(6,4-k)

Number of such sets = C(4,k)*C(6,4-k)

Total number of 4-number sets = C(10,4) = 210.

Calculate for k=2,3,4:

k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90
k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24
k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1=1

Sum = 90+24+1=115

So P(at least 2 match) = 115/210.

Step 5: P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(grand prize) / P(at least 2 match) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So the fraction is 1/115, m=1, n=115, m+n=116.
