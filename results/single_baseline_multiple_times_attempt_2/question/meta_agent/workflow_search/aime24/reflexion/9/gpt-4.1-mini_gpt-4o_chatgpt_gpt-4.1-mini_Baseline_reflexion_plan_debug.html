    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Next, we calculate the number of ways to win a prize, which means at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. We use complementary counting: the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen. If 0 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen, there are \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \) ways. If 1 of Jen&#39;s numbers is chosen, there are \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \) ways. Thus, the number of ways to win a prize is \( 210 - 15 - 80 = 115 \). Now, we calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize, which is when all 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen. There is exactly 1 way to do this. The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Therefore, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so \( m+n = 116 \).
