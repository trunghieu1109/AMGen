    <pre>First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from the same set.

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers.

We want P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(all 4 match) / P(at least 2 match).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways for Jen to pick her 4 numbers: also 210, but fixed since Jen has chosen her 4 numbers.

Step 3: Probability that the lottery&#39;s 4 numbers exactly match Jen&#39;s 4 numbers (grand prize):
Only 1 way (the exact 4 Jen chose) out of 210.

So P(grand prize) = 1/210.

Step 4: Calculate P(at least 2 match).

Let k = number of matches between Jen&#39;s 4 numbers and the lottery&#39;s 4 numbers.

k can be 0,1,2,3,4.

We want P(k &gt;= 2).

Number of ways for the lottery to pick 4 numbers with exactly k matches with Jen&#39;s 4 numbers:
- Choose k numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers: C(4,k)
- Choose (4-k) numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since total 10 - 4 Jen&#39;s numbers = 6): C(6,4-k)

Number of such sets = C(4,k)*C(6,4-k)

Total number of 4-number sets = C(10,4) = 210.

Calculate for k=2,3,4:

k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90
k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24
k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1=1

Sum = 90+24+1=115

So P(at least 2 match) = 115/210.

Step 5: P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(grand prize) / P(at least 2 match) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So the fraction is 1/115, m=1, n=115, m+n=116.
