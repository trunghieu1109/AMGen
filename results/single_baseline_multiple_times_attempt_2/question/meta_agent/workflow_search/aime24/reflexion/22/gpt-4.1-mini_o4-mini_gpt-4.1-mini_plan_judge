Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let the list have 2k entries (even, since the median is not itself in the list).  The unique mode is 9 so 9 must appear more times than any other value; the smallest possibility is that 9 appears twice and every other element appears exactly once.  Then the sum of the two 9’s is 18, so the remaining entries must sum to 12 and be distinct positives ≠9.  With 2k=4 (so k=2), there are two other entries summing to 12; the only choice that gives an integer median not in the list is {5,7}, yielding the sorted list [5,7,9,9], whose median is (7+9)/2=8 (not in the list) and whose sum is 30.  Sum of squares is 5²+7²+9²+9²=25+49+81+81=236.
