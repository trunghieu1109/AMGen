    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. The list consists of positive integers.
2. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
3. The unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
4. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Step 1: Determine the length of the list.
- The median is a positive integer not in the list.
- For the median to be an integer not in the list, the list length must be odd (so the median is the middle element).
- If the median is the middle element, but it is not in the list, this is a contradiction.
- Therefore, the list length must be even, so the median is the average of two middle numbers.
- The median is an integer not in the list, so the two middle numbers must average to an integer not in the list.

Step 2: Let the list length be n (even).
- The median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, where k = n/2.
- The median is an integer not in the list.

Step 3: Since 9 is the unique mode, 9 appears more times than any other number.

Step 4: Try to find a list that satisfies all conditions.

Try n=6 (even length):
- Median is average of 3rd and 4th elements.
- Median is integer not in the list.

Try to construct such a list.

Since 9 is the mode, 9 must appear at least twice.

Try list: [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6], sorted.
- Median = (x3 + x4)/2 = m, m integer, m not in list.

Try to pick x3 and x4 such that their average is integer not in list.

Try x3=8, x4=10, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 is median, not in list.
- 9 is mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- But 9 is not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=7, x4=11, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 is median, not in list.
- 9 must be mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=6, x4=12, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 is median, not in list.
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=5, x4=13, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=4, x4=14, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=3, x4=15, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=2, x4=16, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x3=1, x4=17, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try n=7 (odd length):
- Median is x4.
- Median is integer not in list.
- Median is the middle element, so median must be in list, contradiction.

Try n=5 (odd length):
- Median is x3.
- Median is integer not in list.
- Median must be in list, contradiction.

Try n=8 (even length):
- Median = (x4 + x5)/2 = m, m integer, m not in list.

Try x4=8, x5=10, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 is median, not in list.
- 9 must be mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x4=7, x5=11, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x4=6, x5=12, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x4=5, x5=13, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x4=3, x5=15, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x4=2, x5=16, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try x4=1, x5=17, median=9 (not in list).
- 9 not in list, contradiction.

Try median other than 9.

Try median=5 (not in list).

Try x4=4, x5=6, median=5 (not in list).

Try to build list with 9 as mode.

Try list: [3,4,6,7,9,9,9,?]
Sum so far: 3+4+6+7+9+9+9=47, too big.

Sum must be 30.

Try smaller list.

Try n=5:
Median = x3 = m, m not in list, contradiction.

Try n=4:
Median = (x2 + x3)/2 = m, m integer, m not in list.

Try x2=4, x3=6, median=5 (not in list).

Try list: [3,4,6,9]
Sum=3+4+6+9=22 &lt;30.
Add another 9 to make 9 mode.
List: [3,4,6,9,9]
Sum=31 &gt;30.

Try [2,4,6,9,9]
Sum=30.
Sorted: [2,4,6,9,9]
Median = x3=6, which is in list, contradicts median not in list.
