    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OTkR (yourself):
The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3.

The sphere S has radius 11.

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent externally, the torus touches the sphere along a circle. There are two such positions: one where the torus is tangent along the inner circle of the torus (radius r_i), and one where it is tangent along the outer circle of the torus (radius r_o).

The torus can be thought of as a circle of radius 3 revolving around a circle of radius 6. The cross-section circle has radius 3, and the center of this circle moves along a circle of radius 6.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle. The sphere has radius 11.

We want to find the radii r_i and r_o of the circles of tangency on the torus, and then find r_i - r_o.

Step 1: Understand the geometry of the torus and sphere.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) in the xy-plane around the z-axis.

The torus surface points satisfy:
  (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9

The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11:
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121

Step 2: The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle. The circle of tangency lies on the torus surface and on the sphere surface.

Step 3: The torus has two special circles: the inner circle (closest to the axis) and the outer circle (farthest from the axis).

The inner circle radius is R - r = 6 - 3 = 3.
The outer circle radius is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9.

Step 4: When the torus rests on the sphere, it is tangent along a circle of radius r_i or r_o on the torus. These correspond to the inner and outer circles of the torus.

Step 5: The sphere radius is 11, which is larger than the outer radius of the torus (9), so the torus can rest on the sphere in two ways:
- The torus is tangent along the inner circle (radius 3) to the sphere.
- The torus is tangent along the outer circle (radius 9) to the sphere.

Step 6: The problem states that when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_o. This seems to be a typo or misstatement, but presumably, one is the inner circle and one is the outer circle.

Step 7: The difference r_i - r_o is to be found.

Step 8: To find r_i and r_o, consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the cross-sectional circle of the torus at the point of tangency.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The radius of this circle on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency in the xy-plane.

Step 9: The torus cross-section circle center moves along a circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane. The cross-section circle has radius 3.

Step 10: The sphere has radius 11. The torus is tangent to the sphere externally, so the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-section circle plus or minus 3 equals 11.

Let d be the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-section circle at the point of tangency.

Then, the sphere radius 11 equals d Â± 3.

So, two cases:
- d + 3 = 11 =&gt; d = 8
- d - 3 = 11 =&gt; d = 14

Step 11: The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency, which is the radius of the center circle of the torus (6) plus or minus the radius of the cross-section circle (3), depending on the position.

But here, the center of the cross-section circle is at distance d from the origin, so the radius of the circle of tangency is r_t = sqrt(d^2 - z^2), but since the circle lies in the xy-plane, z=0, so r_t = d.

Step 12: So the radii of the circles of tangency are r_i = 8 and r_o = 14.

Step 13: The difference r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6.

But the problem states r_i - r_o = m/n with positive integers m and n, so take absolute value: 6.

Step 14: The problem likely expects the difference as a positive fraction in lowest terms.

6 = 6/1, so m=6, n=1, m+n=7.

Answer: 7.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OTkR (yourself):
7

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent pTdI:
The reasoning has a critical flaw in interpreting the distances and the radii of the circles of tangency. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6, so the torus has a major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The sphere has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle. The key is to find the radii r_i and r_o of these circles of tangency on the torus. The circles of tangency lie on the torus surface, which satisfies (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and on the sphere x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. The torus can be tangent to the sphere in two ways: one where the cross-sectional circle center is at distance d from the origin such that d + 3 = 11 (d=8), and one where d - 3 = 11 (d=14). However, the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency, which is the radius of the circle traced by the center of the cross-sectional circle, which is 6, plus or minus the vertical offset. The problem is that the previous solution equated the radius of the circle of tangency directly to d, which is the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle, but the torus is generated by revolving the circle around the z-axis, so the radius of the circle of tangency is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency, which is the radius of the circle traced by the center of the cross-sectional circle (6) plus or minus the radius of the cross-sectional circle (3). The correct approach is to find the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle (d), then the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency, which is the radius of the circle traced by the center of the cross-sectional circle (6) plus or minus the vertical offset (which is sqrt(r^2 - (d - 6)^2)). After careful calculation, the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to 36/11, so m=36, n=11, and m+n=47. Therefore, the answer 7 is incorrect.

    <pre>The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6 from the center of the circle. So the torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle. We want to find the radii r_i and r_o of these circles of tangency on the torus and then find r_i - r_o.

The torus surface satisfies (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.
The sphere satisfies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The circle of tangency lies on both surfaces.

Let d be the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle of the torus at the point of tangency. The cross-sectional circle has radius 3 and its center moves on a circle of radius 6 around the z-axis.

The sphere radius is 11. The torus is tangent externally, so the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle plus or minus 3 equals 11:
- d + 3 = 11 =&gt; d = 8
- d - 3 = 11 =&gt; d = 14

Now, the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency, which is the radius of the circle traced by the center of the cross-sectional circle (6) plus or minus the vertical offset z, where z = sqrt(9 - (d - 6)^2).

Calculate z for d=8:
(d - 6)^2 = (8 - 6)^2 = 4
z = sqrt(9 - 4) = sqrt(5)
Radius of circle of tangency r_i = 6 + z = 6 + sqrt(5)

Calculate z for d=14:
(d - 6)^2 = (14 - 6)^2 = 64
z = sqrt(9 - 64) = sqrt(-55) which is not real, so this case is invalid.

Try the other sign for radius of circle of tangency:
r_o = 6 - sqrt(5)

So the two radii of the circles of tangency are r_i = 6 + sqrt(5) and r_o = 6 - sqrt(5).

Then r_i - r_o = (6 + sqrt(5)) - (6 - sqrt(5)) = 2 sqrt(5).

Express 2 sqrt(5) as a fraction m/n in lowest terms:
2 sqrt(5) is irrational, so the problem likely expects the difference in terms of rational numbers.

Re-examining the problem, the difference r_i - r_o can be written as m/n, so the difference must be rational.

Reconsider the approach:
The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle is d.
The sphere radius is 11.
The torus cross-sectional circle radius is 3.

The distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle is d.
The distance from the origin to the point of tangency is the radius of the circle of tangency r_t.

From the torus equation:
(r_t - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
From the sphere equation:
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121

Subtracting the first from the second:
r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t - 6)^2 + z^2) = 121 - 9
r_t^2 - (r_t^2 - 12 r_t + 36) = 112
12 r_t - 36 = 112
12 r_t = 148
r_t = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3

So the radius of the circle of tangency is r_t = 37/3.

But the problem states there are two such circles, with radii r_i and r_o.

Try the other sign in the subtraction:
From the sphere and torus equations:
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121
(r_t - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
Subtracting the second from the first:
121 - 9 = r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t - 6)^2 + z^2) = r_t^2 - (r_t^2 - 12 r_t + 36) = 12 r_t - 36
112 = 12 r_t - 36
12 r_t = 148
r_t = 37/3

This is the same as above.

Alternatively, consider the other possibility:
(r_t - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121
Subtract first from second:
121 - 9 = r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t - 6)^2 + z^2) = r_t^2 - (r_t^2 - 12 r_t + 36) = 12 r_t - 36
112 = 12 r_t - 36
12 r_t = 148
r_t = 37/3

So the radius of the circle of tangency is 37/3.

But the problem says there are two such circles, so consider the other possibility:
(r_t + 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121
Subtract first from second:
121 - 9 = r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t + 6)^2 + z^2) = r_t^2 - (r_t^2 + 12 r_t + 36) = -12 r_t - 36
112 = -12 r_t - 36
12 r_t = -148
r_t = -37/3 (not possible since radius is positive)

Therefore, the two radii of the circles of tangency are r_i = 37/3 and r_o = 11 - 3 = 8 (from the initial consideration d + 3 = 11 =&gt; d=8).

So r_i = 37/3, r_o = 8

Difference r_i - r_o = 37/3 - 8 = (37 - 24)/3 = 13/3

Thus m=13, n=3, m+n=16.
