Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6 from the center of the circle. So the torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle. We want to find the radii r_i and r_o of these circles of tangency on the torus and then find r_i - r_o.

The torus surface satisfies (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.
The sphere satisfies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The circle of tangency lies on both surfaces.

Let d be the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle of the torus at the point of tangency. The cross-sectional circle has radius 3 and its center moves on a circle of radius 6 around the z-axis.

The sphere radius is 11. The torus is tangent externally, so the distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle plus or minus 3 equals 11:
- d + 3 = 11 => d = 8
- d - 3 = 11 => d = 14

Now, the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency, which is the radius of the circle traced by the center of the cross-sectional circle (6) plus or minus the vertical offset z, where z = sqrt(9 - (d - 6)^2).

Calculate z for d=8:
(d - 6)^2 = (8 - 6)^2 = 4
z = sqrt(9 - 4) = sqrt(5)
Radius of circle of tangency r_i = 6 + z = 6 + sqrt(5)

Calculate z for d=14:
(d - 6)^2 = (14 - 6)^2 = 64
z = sqrt(9 - 64) = sqrt(-55) which is not real, so this case is invalid.

Try the other sign for radius of circle of tangency:
r_o = 6 - sqrt(5)

So the two radii of the circles of tangency are r_i = 6 + sqrt(5) and r_o = 6 - sqrt(5).

Then r_i - r_o = (6 + sqrt(5)) - (6 - sqrt(5)) = 2 sqrt(5).

Express 2 sqrt(5) as a fraction m/n in lowest terms:
2 sqrt(5) is irrational, so the problem likely expects the difference in terms of rational numbers.

Re-examining the problem, the difference r_i - r_o can be written as m/n, so the difference must be rational.

Reconsider the approach:
The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle is d.
The sphere radius is 11.
The torus cross-sectional circle radius is 3.

The distance from the origin to the center of the cross-sectional circle is d.
The distance from the origin to the point of tangency is the radius of the circle of tangency r_t.

From the torus equation:
(r_t - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
From the sphere equation:
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121

Subtracting the first from the second:
r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t - 6)^2 + z^2) = 121 - 9
r_t^2 - (r_t^2 - 12 r_t + 36) = 112
12 r_t - 36 = 112
12 r_t = 148
r_t = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3

So the radius of the circle of tangency is r_t = 37/3.

But the problem states there are two such circles, with radii r_i and r_o.

Try the other sign in the subtraction:
From the sphere and torus equations:
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121
(r_t - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
Subtracting the second from the first:
121 - 9 = r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t - 6)^2 + z^2) = r_t^2 - (r_t^2 - 12 r_t + 36) = 12 r_t - 36
112 = 12 r_t - 36
12 r_t = 148
r_t = 37/3

This is the same as above.

Alternatively, consider the other possibility:
(r_t - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121
Subtract first from second:
121 - 9 = r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t - 6)^2 + z^2) = r_t^2 - (r_t^2 - 12 r_t + 36) = 12 r_t - 36
112 = 12 r_t - 36
12 r_t = 148
r_t = 37/3

So the radius of the circle of tangency is 37/3.

But the problem says there are two such circles, so consider the other possibility:
(r_t + 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
r_t^2 + z^2 = 121
Subtract first from second:
121 - 9 = r_t^2 + z^2 - ((r_t + 6)^2 + z^2) = r_t^2 - (r_t^2 + 12 r_t + 36) = -12 r_t - 36
112 = -12 r_t - 36
12 r_t = -148
r_t = -37/3 (not possible since radius is positive)

Therefore, the two radii of the circles of tangency are r_i = 37/3 and r_o = 11 - 3 = 8 (from the initial consideration d + 3 = 11 => d=8).

So r_i = 37/3, r_o = 8

Difference r_i - r_o = 37/3 - 8 = (37 - 24)/3 = 13/3

Thus m=13, n=3, m+n=16.
