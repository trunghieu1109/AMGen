Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ObKx', content='We place the torus axis vertical and let the sphere of radius 11 be centered at the origin.  Write the torus surface as (√(x²+y²)−6)²+(z−h)²=9 with the tube center at height h.  A point (r, z) on the torus satisfies r²+z²=121 when it touches the sphere.  For tangency along a horizontal circle the normals must align, giving (r−6,z−h)∥(r,z).  From that we get h=6z/r and 12r+2hz=h²+148 together with z²=121−r².  Eliminating h and z² yields 28r²−363r+1089=0, whose roots are r=33/4 and r=33/7.  The two contact circles have radii 33/4 and 33/7, so their difference is 33/4−33/7=99/28, and 99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
