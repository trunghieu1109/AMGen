Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ecrm', content='The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radii of the tangent circles are the distances from the center of the torus to the points of tangency. For external tangency, this is 6 - 3 = 3, and for internal tangency, this is 6 + 3 = 9. The difference is 9 - 3 = 6. However, the correct difference in terms of the radii of the tangent circles is 9 - 3 = 6, which can be written as 6/1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 7.\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radii of the tangent circles are the distances from the center of the torus to the points of tangency. For external tangency, this is 6 - 3 = 3, and for internal tangency, this is 6 + 3 = 9. The difference is 9 - 3 = 6. However, we need to find the difference in terms of the radii of the tangent circles, which are 3 and 9. The difference is 9 - 3 = 6, which can be written as 6/1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 7.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ecrm (yourself):\n7\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent e0rM:\nThe reasoning and calculations are incorrect. The correct approach involves understanding the geometry of the torus and sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radii of the tangent circles are the distances from the center of the torus to the points of tangency. For external tangency, this is 6 - 3 = 3, and for internal tangency, this is 6 + 3 = 9. The difference is 9 - 3 = 6. However, the correct difference in terms of the radii of the tangent circles is 9 - 3 = 6, which can be written as 6/1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 7.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
