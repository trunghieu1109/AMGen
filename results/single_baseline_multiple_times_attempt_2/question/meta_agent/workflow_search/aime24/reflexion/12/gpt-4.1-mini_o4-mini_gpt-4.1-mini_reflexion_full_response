Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8sTG', content='Let z=4e^{iθ}. Then f(z)=(75+117i)z+(96+144i)/z =4A e^{iθ}+B e^{-iθ} with A=75+117i, B=24+36i. The maximum of Re[f] equals |4A+conj(B)|.

The real part is 4|75+117i|cos(θ−α)+|24+36i|cos(θ−β), maximized as sqrt((4|a|)^2+(|b|)^2+2·4|a|·|b|·cos(α−β)). Compute |a|=√19314, |b|=12√13, cos(α−β)=6012/(|a||b|). Then maximum =√(309024+1872+48096)=√358992=36√277.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8sTG (yourself):\n36√277\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent yFEi:\nThe error is in combining the two cosine terms. Writing 4|A|cos(θ+α)+|B|cos(θ−β) as Xcos(θ−δ1)+Ycos(θ−δ2) gives δ1=−α and δ2=β, so the phase difference is δ1−δ2=−(α+β), not α−β. Using cos(α+β) yields max² = 16|A|²+|B|²+8|A||B|cos(α+β) = 291600, so the maximum real part is 540.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.'}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
