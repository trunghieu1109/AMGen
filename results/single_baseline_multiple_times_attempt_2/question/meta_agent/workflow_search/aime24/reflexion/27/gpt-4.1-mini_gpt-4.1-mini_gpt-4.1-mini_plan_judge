Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let the four-digit number be N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits and a ≠ 0. We want the greatest such N with the property that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Changing the thousands digit to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
Changing the hundreds digit to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
Changing the tens digit to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be divisible by 7.
Changing the units digit to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

We want the greatest N, so start with a=9 (largest thousands digit).

Define:
M1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d
M2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d
M3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d
M4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

All M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7.

Since a=9, M2, M3, M4 depend on b,c,d.

We can write the divisibility conditions modulo 7:

1000 mod 7 = 6 (since 7*142=994, remainder 6)
100 mod 7 = 2 (7*14=98, remainder 2)
10 mod 7 = 3

So,
M1 mod 7 = (6*1 + 2b + 3c + d) mod 7 = (6 + 2b + 3c + d) mod 7 = 0
M2 mod 7 = (6a + 2*1 + 3c + d) mod 7 = (6*9 + 2 + 3c + d) mod 7 = (54 + 2 + 3c + d) mod 7 = (56 + 3c + d) mod 7 = (0 + 3c + d) mod 7 = (3c + d) mod 7 = 0
M3 mod 7 = (6a + 2b + 3*1 + d) mod 7 = (54 + 2b + 3 + d) mod 7 = (57 + 2b + d) mod 7 = (1 + 2b + d) mod 7 = 0
M4 mod 7 = (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) mod 7 = (54 + 2b + 3c + 1) mod 7 = (55 + 2b + 3c) mod 7 = (6 + 2b + 3c) mod 7 = 0

So the system is:
1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
2) 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
3) 1 + 2b + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
4) 6 + 2b + 3c ≡ 0 (mod 7)

From (2): d ≡ -3c (mod 7)
From (4): 2b ≡ -6 - 3c ≡ 1 - 3c (mod 7) (since -6 ≡ 1 mod 7)
From (3): 1 + 2b + d ≡ 0 => 2b + d ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7)
Substitute d from (2): 2b - 3c ≡ 6 (mod 7)

From (4), 2b ≡ 1 - 3c
Substitute into above: (1 - 3c) - 3c ≡ 6 => 1 - 6c ≡ 6 => -6c ≡ 5 => 6c ≡ 2 (mod 7)
Since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, 6c ≡ 2 => -c ≡ 2 => c ≡ -2 ≡ 5 (mod 7)

So c ≡ 5 mod 7, c ∈ {0,...,9}, so c=5 or c=12 (not digit), so c=5.

Then d ≡ -3c ≡ -15 ≡ -15 + 21 = 6 (mod 7), so d ≡ 6 mod 7.
Possible d: 6 or 13 (not digit), so d=6.

From (4): 2b ≡ 1 - 3c = 1 - 15 = -14 ≡ 0 (mod 7), so 2b ≡ 0 => b ≡ 0 (mod 7)
Possible b: 0 or 7.

Check (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0
6 + 2b + 15 + 6 = 27 + 2b ≡ 27 + 2b mod 7
27 mod 7 = 6, so 6 + 2b ≡ 0 => 2b ≡ 1 (mod 7)
But from above 2b ≡ 0, contradiction.

So no solution with a=9.

Try a=8:
M2 mod 7 = 6*8 + 2 + 3c + d = 48 + 2 + 3c + d = 50 + 3c + d ≡ 1 + 3c + d (mod 7)
Set to 0: 1 + 3c + d ≡ 0 => 3c + d ≡ 6 (mod 7)

M3 mod 7 = 6*8 + 2b + 3 + d = 48 + 2b + 3 + d = 51 + 2b + d ≡ 2 + 2b + d (mod 7)
Set to 0: 2 + 2b + d ≡ 0 => 2b + d ≡ 5 (mod 7)

M4 mod 7 = 6*8 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 48 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 49 + 2b + 3c ≡ 0 + 2b + 3c (mod 7)
Set to 0: 2b + 3c ≡ 0 (mod 7)

M1 mod 7 = 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0

From M2: 3c + d ≡ 6
From M3: 2b + d ≡ 5
From M4: 2b + 3c ≡ 0

From M4: 2b ≡ -3c (mod 7)
From M3: 2b + d ≡ 5 => d ≡ 5 - 2b
From M2: 3c + d ≡ 6 => d ≡ 6 - 3c

Equate d: 5 - 2b ≡ 6 - 3c => -2b ≡ 1 - 3c => 2b ≡ 3c - 1
From M4: 2b ≡ -3c
So 3c - 1 ≡ -3c => 3c - 1 + 3c ≡ 0 => 6c ≡ 1 (mod 7)
6c ≡ 1 => -c ≡ 1 => c ≡ 6 (mod 7)

c=6 or 13(not digit), so c=6

Then 2b ≡ -3c = -18 ≡ -18 + 21 = 3 (mod 7)
So 2b ≡ 3 => b ≡ 5 (mod 7)
Possible b=5 or 12(not digit), so b=5

d ≡ 6 - 3c = 6 - 18 = -12 ≡ -12 + 14 = 2 (mod 7)
Possible d=2 or 9

Check M1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 10 + 18 + d = 34 + d
For d=2: 36 mod 7 = 1 (not 0)
For d=9: 43 mod 7 = 1 (not 0)
No solution for a=8.

Try a=7:
M2: 6*7 + 2 + 3c + d = 42 + 2 + 3c + d = 44 + 3c + d ≡ 2 + 3c + d
Set to 0: 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 => 3c + d ≡ 5
M3: 6*7 + 2b + 3 + d = 42 + 2b + 3 + d = 45 + 2b + d ≡ 3 + 2b + d
Set to 0: 3 + 2b + d ≡ 0 => 2b + d ≡ 4
M4: 6*7 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 42 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 43 + 2b + 3c ≡ 1 + 2b + 3c
Set to 0: 1 + 2b + 3c ≡ 0 => 2b + 3c ≡ 6

From M4: 2b ≡ 6 - 3c
From M3: 2b + d ≡ 4 => d ≡ 4 - 2b
From M2: 3c + d ≡ 5 => d ≡ 5 - 3c

Equate d: 4 - 2b ≡ 5 - 3c => -2b ≡ 1 - 3c => 2b ≡ 3c - 1
From M4: 2b ≡ 6 - 3c
Equate: 3c - 1 ≡ 6 - 3c => 6c ≡ 7 => 6c ≡ 0 (mod 7)

So 6c ≡ 0 => -c ≡ 0 => c ≡ 0

c=0

Then 2b ≡ 6 - 0 = 6 => 2b ≡ 6 => b ≡ 3

d ≡ 5 - 3c = 5 - 0 = 5

Check M1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 17 ≡ 3 (mod 7), not 0
No solution for a=7.

Try a=6:
M2: 6*6 + 2 + 3c + d = 36 + 2 + 3c + d = 38 + 3c + d ≡ 3 + 3c + d
Set to 0: 3 + 3c + d ≡ 0 => 3c + d ≡ 4
M3: 6*6 + 2b + 3 + d = 36 + 2b + 3 + d = 39 + 2b + d ≡ 4 + 2b + d
Set to 0: 4 + 2b + d ≡ 0 => 2b + d ≡ 3
M4: 6*6 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 36 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 37 + 2b + 3c ≡ 2 + 2b + 3c
Set to 0: 2 + 2b + 3c ≡ 0 => 2b + 3c ≡ 5

From M4: 2b ≡ 5 - 3c
From M3: 2b + d ≡ 3 => d ≡ 3 - 2b
From M2: 3c + d ≡ 4 => d ≡ 4 - 3c

Equate d: 3 - 2b ≡ 4 - 3c => -2b ≡ 1 - 3c => 2b ≡ 3c - 1
From M4: 2b ≡ 5 - 3c
Equate: 3c - 1 ≡ 5 - 3c => 6c ≡ 6 => 6c ≡ 6

6c ≡ 6 => -c ≡ 6 => c ≡ 1

c=1

Then 2b ≡ 5 - 3c = 5 - 3 = 2 => 2b ≡ 2 => b ≡ 1

d ≡ 4 - 3c = 4 - 3 = 1

Check M1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 12 ≡ 5 (mod 7), not 0
No solution for a=6.

Try a=5:
M2: 6*5 + 2 + 3c + d = 30 + 2 + 3c + d = 32 + 3c + d ≡ 4 + 3c + d
Set to 0: 4 + 3c + d ≡ 0 => 3c + d ≡ 3
M3: 6*5 + 2b + 3 + d = 30 + 2b + 3 + d = 33 + 2b + d ≡ 5 + 2b + d
Set to 0: 5 + 2b + d ≡ 0 => 2b + d ≡ 2
M4: 6*5 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 30 + 2b + 3c + 1 = 31 + 2b + 3c ≡ 3 + 2b + 3c
Set to 0: 3 + 2b + 3c ≡ 0 => 2b + 3c ≡ 4

From M4: 2b ≡ 4 - 3c
From M3: 2b + d ≡ 2 => d ≡ 2 - 2b
From M2: 3c + d ≡ 3 => d ≡ 3 - 3c

Equate d: 2 - 2b ≡ 3 - 3c => -2b ≡ 1 - 3c => 2b ≡ 3c - 1
From M4: 2b ≡ 4 - 3c
Equate: 3c - 1 ≡ 4 - 3c => 6c ≡ 5

6c ≡ 5 => -c ≡ 5 => c ≡ 2

c=2

Then 2b ≡ 4 - 3c = 4 - 6 = -2 ≡ 5 => 2b ≡ 5 => b ≡ 6

d ≡ 3 - 3c = 3 - 6 = -3 ≡ 4

Check M1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 12 + 6 + 4 = 28 ≡ 0 (mod 7), good.

So digits are a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4

N = 5624

Check all changed digits to 1:
Change a: 1624 / 7 = 232 (integer)
Change b: 5124 / 7 = 732 (integer)
Change c: 5614 / 7 = 802 (integer)
Change d: 5621 / 7 = 803 (integer)

All divisible by 7.

Try a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4 is valid.

Try to increase d to 5:
Check M1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 12 + 6 + 5 = 29 ≡ 1 (mod 7), no.

Try b=6, c=2, d=4 is max.

Try b=6, c=2, d=4 is the greatest number with a=5.

Try a=4 or less will be smaller number.

So N=5624.

Q = N // 1000 = 5
R = N % 1000 = 624
Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629
