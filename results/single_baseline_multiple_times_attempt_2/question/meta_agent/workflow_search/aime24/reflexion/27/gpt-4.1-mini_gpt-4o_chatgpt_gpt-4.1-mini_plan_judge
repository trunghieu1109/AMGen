Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start by considering the number 9999, the largest four-digit number, and check if changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We will systematically check each digit position.

1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1999. Check divisibility by 7: 1999 mod 7 = 2 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9199. Check divisibility by 7: 9199 mod 7 = 1 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 mod 7 = 0 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9991. Check divisibility by 7: 9991 mod 7 = 6 (not divisible).

Since changing the tens digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we have a candidate for N. We need to ensure that this is the greatest such number. We check numbers less than 9999 to see if they satisfy the condition for all digit changes.

We try 9989:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1989. Check divisibility by 7: 1989 mod 7 = 0 (divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9189. Check divisibility by 7: 9189 mod 7 = 0 (divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 mod 7 = 0 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9981. Check divisibility by 7: 9981 mod 7 = 0 (divisible).

9989 satisfies the condition for all digit changes, and it is greater than 9919. Therefore, N = 9989.

Now, we find Q and R when N = 9989 is divided by 1000:
Q = 9989 // 1000 = 9
R = 9989 % 1000 = 989

Finally, we calculate Q + R = 9 + 989 = 998.

Answer:998
Extracted answer: 998
Correct answer: 699
