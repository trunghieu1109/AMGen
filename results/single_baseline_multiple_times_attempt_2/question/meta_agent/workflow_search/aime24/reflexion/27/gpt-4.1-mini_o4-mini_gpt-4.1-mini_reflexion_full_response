Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TUmu', content='We need a 4‐digit number N=abcd (a≠0) such that replacing each digit in turn by 1 yields a multiple of 7.  Write congruences mod\u20097 for each replacement, solve the resulting system:\nLet a,b,c,d be digits.  Replacing digit k by 1 gives linear congruences in a,b,c,d.  Solving them shows a≡5 mod\u20097, b≡a+1, c≡2a+6, d≡2a+1 (all mod\u20097).  The only digit‐valid solution is a=5.  Then b=6, c=2 or 9, d=4, giving N=5624 or 5694; the larger is N=5694.  Finally, Q=floor(5694/1000)=5, R=694, so Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
