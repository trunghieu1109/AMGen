Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We need a 4‐digit number N=abcd (a≠0) such that replacing each digit in turn by 1 yields a multiple of 7.  Write congruences mod 7 for each replacement, solve the resulting system:
Let a,b,c,d be digits.  Replacing digit k by 1 gives linear congruences in a,b,c,d.  Solving them shows a≡5 mod 7, b≡a+1, c≡2a+6, d≡2a+1 (all mod 7).  The only digit‐valid solution is a=5.  Then b=6, c=2 or 9, d=4, giving N=5624 or 5694; the larger is N=5694.  Finally, Q=floor(5694/1000)=5, R=694, so Q+R=699.
