Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let the number of residents with exactly one, two, three, and four items be a, 437, 234, and x respectively. Since everyone owns candy hearts, total residents: a+437+234+x=900, so a=229−x. The total ownership count is |D|+|G|+|S|+|C|=195+367+562+900=2024. This also equals 1·(229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=1805+3x. Equate: 1805+3x=2024 gives 3x=219, x=73.
