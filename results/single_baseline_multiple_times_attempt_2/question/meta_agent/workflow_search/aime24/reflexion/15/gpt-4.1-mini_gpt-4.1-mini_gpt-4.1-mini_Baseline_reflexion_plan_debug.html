    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

    <pre>Let&#39;s define the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since every resident owns candy hearts). Total residents = 900. Number of residents owning exactly two of these things = 437. Number of residents owning exactly three of these things = 234. We want to find the number of residents owning all four things (D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning candy hearts is universal, so the problem reduces to finding the number of residents owning all three of the other items (D, G, S) plus candy hearts. But since candy hearts is owned by all, the number owning all four is the same as the number owning all three of D, G, and S. Let&#39;s denote x = number of residents owning all three of D, G, and S. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about exactly two and exactly three owners to find x. Let’s denote: - a = number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S (and candy hearts) - b = number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S (and candy hearts) = 437 - c = number of residents owning exactly three of D, G, S (and candy hearts) = 234 - d = number of residents owning none of D, G, S (but candy hearts) Since everyone owns candy hearts, the total 900 residents are partitioned into these groups: a + b + c + d = 900. We know b = 437, c = 234. We want to find c, but c is given as 234, so the number owning all three D, G, S is 234. Since candy hearts is owned by all, the number owning all four is 234. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four things is 234.
