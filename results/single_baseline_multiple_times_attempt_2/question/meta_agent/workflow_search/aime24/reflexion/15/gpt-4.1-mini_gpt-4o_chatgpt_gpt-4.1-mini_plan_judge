Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so we focus on the other three items. Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. We have the following information: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, 437 own exactly two of these three items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), we have: Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 3 * 234. The total number of residents who own at least one of the three items is 900 - x. Therefore, 900 - x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (437 + 3 * 234) + 234. Solving for x gives us the number of residents who own all four items.
