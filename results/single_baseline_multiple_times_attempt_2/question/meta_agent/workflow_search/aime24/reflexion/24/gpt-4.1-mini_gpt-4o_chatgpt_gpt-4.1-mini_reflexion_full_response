Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9K6t', content='We start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form. The first equation is \\( \\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which implies \\( \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2} \\). Similarly, the second equation \\( \\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\) implies \\( \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\), and the third equation \\( \\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\) implies \\( \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\). We can express these in terms of powers of 2: \\( x = yz \\cdot 2^{1/2} \\), \\( y = xz \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\), and \\( z = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4} \\). We need to find \\( \\left|\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\\right| \\). First, express \\( x^4y^3z^2 \\) in terms of powers of 2. Substitute the expressions for \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) into \\( x^4y^3z^2 \\) and simplify. After simplification, we find that \\( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{1/2} \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} \\). Calculate \\( 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12 \\). Therefore, \\( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{13/12} \\). The logarithm is \\( \\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 13/12 \\). The absolute value is \\( \\left|\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\\right| = 13/12 \\). The fraction \\( 13/12 \\) is already in simplest form, so \\( m = 13 \\) and \\( n = 12 \\). Thus, \\( m+n = 25 \\).\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
