Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qPlV', content='To find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider integers n that have exactly two digits in base b, meaning n = d1*b + d0 where 1 <= d1 < b and 0 <= d0 < b. Additionally, d1 + d0 must equal sqrt(n), which implies n is a perfect square. We will iterate over possible values of b starting from 2, and for each b, we will count the number of such n. We will stop when we find a base b with more than ten b-beautiful integers.\n\nAnswer:14', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, say d1 and d0, such that n = d1*b + d0 and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). The digits d1 and d0 must satisfy 1 <= d1 < b and 0 <= d0 < b. Also, since n is a perfect square, sqrt(n) must be an integer. We need to count how many such n exist for a given b and find the smallest b for which this count exceeds 10. Let's start with b = 2 and increase b until we find the desired count. For each b, we iterate over possible values of d1 and d0, compute n, and check if d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent qPlV (yourself):\n14\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent w4Kp:\nThe solution approach is correct, but the final answer needs verification. We need to check the calculations for each base to ensure the count of b-beautiful integers is accurate.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
