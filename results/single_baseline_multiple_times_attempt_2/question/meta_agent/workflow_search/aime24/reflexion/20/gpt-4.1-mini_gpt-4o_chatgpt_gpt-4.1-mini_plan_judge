Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider integers n that have exactly two digits in base b, meaning n = d1*b + d0 where 1 <= d1 < b and 0 <= d0 < b. Additionally, d1 + d0 must equal sqrt(n), which implies n is a perfect square. We will iterate over possible values of b starting from 2, and for each b, we will count the number of such n. We will stop when we find a base b with more than ten b-beautiful integers.
