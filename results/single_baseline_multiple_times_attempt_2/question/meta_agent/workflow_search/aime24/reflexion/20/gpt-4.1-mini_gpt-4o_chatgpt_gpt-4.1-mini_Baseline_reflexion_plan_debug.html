    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent qPlV (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, say d1 and d0, such that n = d1*b + d0 and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). The digits d1 and d0 must satisfy 1 &lt;= d1 &lt; b and 0 &lt;= d0 &lt; b. Also, since n is a perfect square, sqrt(n) must be an integer. We need to count how many such n exist for a given b and find the smallest b for which this count exceeds 10. Let&#39;s start with b = 2 and increase b until we find the desired count. For each b, we iterate over possible values of d1 and d0, compute n, and check if d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).

14

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent w4Kp:
The solution approach is correct, but the final answer needs verification. We need to check the calculations for each base to ensure the count of b-beautiful integers is accurate.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>To find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider integers n that have exactly two digits in base b, meaning n = d1*b + d0 where 1 &lt;= d1 &lt; b and 0 &lt;= d0 &lt; b. Additionally, d1 + d0 must equal sqrt(n), which implies n is a perfect square. We will iterate over possible values of b starting from 2, and for each b, we will count the number of such n. We will stop when we find a base b with more than ten b-beautiful integers.
