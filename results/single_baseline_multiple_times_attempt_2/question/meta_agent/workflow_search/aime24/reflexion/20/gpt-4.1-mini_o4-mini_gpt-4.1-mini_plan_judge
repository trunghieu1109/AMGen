Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We want the number of positive integers n that are “b-eautiful,” i.e. n has two digits x,y in base b (1≤x≤b−1,0≤y≤b−1) and x+y = √n.  Writing n = xb + y and squaring gives xb+y = (x+y)^2, which simplifies to the condition that D = 4x(b−1)+1 is a perfect square for some x.  An equivalent reformulation is that for D = b−1, the number of solutions t in {1,…,D} to t(t+1)≡0 mod D counts exactly the number of b-eautiful n.  But t(t+1)≡0 mod D holds mod each prime power dividing D only if t≡0 or −1 mod that prime power; by the Chinese remainder theorem there are 2^ω(D) solutions mod D, and excluding t≡0 gives 2^ω(D)−1 valid t’s.  We need 2^ω(D)−1 > 10, so 2^ω(D) ≥ 11 ⇒ ω(D) ≥ 4.  The smallest D with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7 = 210, so b = D+1 = 211.
