Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OOId', content='We need P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity.  Equivalently P = ∏_{ζ^13=1}(ζ^2 - 2ζ + 2).  This is the resultant of f(x)=x^2-2x+2 and g(x)=x^13-1, namely ∏_{ζ^13=1}f(ζ).  Since f has roots α=1±i, the product equals ∏_{α}(α^13 - 1).  Compute α=1+i in polar form: |α|=√2, arg=π/4, so α^13=(√2)^13 cis(13π/4)=2^{6.5}cis(5π/4) = -64(1+i).  Thus α^13 - 1 = -65 -64i, and its conjugate is -65 +64i.  Their product is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.  Finally 8321 mod 1000 = 321.\n\nAnswer:321', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
