proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We can rewrite the expression inside the product as \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \( x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). The product of the roots of the polynomial \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \) is 1. Therefore, the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) = 1 \). Now, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1) \). Since \( \omega^k \) are the roots of unity, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of unity is zero. Therefore, the product simplifies to \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) = 1 \). The expression \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \) can be rewritten as \( 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} + 1 = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \). The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial at the roots of unity. The polynomial is \( (x-1)^{13} \). Therefore, the product is \( 2^{13} \). We need to find the remainder of \( 2^{13} \) when divided by 1000. Calculating \( 2^{13} = 8192 \), and the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000 is 192.
