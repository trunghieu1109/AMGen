    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with given surface area and volume. Let the dimensions of the box be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The surface area is $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$, and the volume is $xyz = 23$. The smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half the length of the box&#39;s diagonal, which is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. We need to minimize this diagonal length. Using the surface area equation, we can express $xy + yz + zx = 27$. We also have $xyz = 23$. We can use the identity $(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)$ to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $x+y+z$ and $xy + yz + zx$. Let $s = x+y+z$. Then $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 54$. We want to minimize $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which is equivalent to minimizing $s^2 - 54$. We also have $x$, $y$, and $z$ as the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - st^2 + 27t - 23 = 0$. By Vieta&#39;s formulas, $s = x+y+z$. To find the minimum value of $s$, we can use the AM-GM inequality: $\frac{x+y+z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} = \sqrt[3]{23}$, so $s \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}$. We approximate $\sqrt[3]{23} \approx 2.843$, so $s \geq 3 \times 2.843 \approx 8.529$. We test $s = 9$ to see if it is possible. If $s = 9$, then $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9^2 - 54 = 27$. The diagonal length is $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$. The radius of the sphere is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $r^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{4}$. Therefore, $p = 27$ and $q = 4$, and $p+q = 31$.
