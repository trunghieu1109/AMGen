Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We want the largest space‐diagonal of any box with surface area 54 and volume 23.  Let the edges be x,y,z>0.  Then ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23.  We maximize d^2=x^2+y^2+z^2.  By symmetry, extrema occur when two sides are equal: x=y=a, z=b.  Then 2ab+a^2=27 and a^2b=23.  Sub b=23/a^2 into the first: 2a(23/a^2)+a^2=27 →46/a+a^2=27 →a^3−27a+46=0.  Roots: a=2 or a=−1+2√6 (positive).  For a=2, b=23/4=5.75 gives d^2=2·4+(5.75)^2=41.0625=657/16.  For a=−1+2√6, d^2≈32.70<657/16.  So the maximum diagonal squared is 657/16, and the required sphere radius is half the diagonal, so r^2=(657/16)/4=657/64.  Thus p+q=657+64=721.
