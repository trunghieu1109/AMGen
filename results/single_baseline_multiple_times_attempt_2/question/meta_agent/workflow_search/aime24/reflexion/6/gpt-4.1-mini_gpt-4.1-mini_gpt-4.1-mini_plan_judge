Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, z. We have two conditions:
1) Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27
2) Volume: xyz = 23

We want to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The smallest sphere that contains a rectangular box is the sphere centered at the center of the box with radius equal to half the space diagonal of the box.

The space diagonal d of the box is given by d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).

We want to minimize the radius r = d/2, or equivalently minimize d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, subject to the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Using the identity:
(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)
=> x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54

So minimizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2.

Let s = x + y + z.

We want to minimize s^2 subject to xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Using Lagrange multipliers or symmetry, the minimum occurs when two variables are equal, say x = y.

Set x = y = t, then:
- xy + yz + zx = t^2 + 2tz = 27
- xyz = t * t * z = t^2 z = 23

From the second equation: z = 23 / t^2

Substitute into the first:
 t^2 + 2t * (23 / t^2) = 27
 t^2 + 46 / t = 27
 Multiply both sides by t:
 t^3 + 46 = 27 t
 Rearrange:
 t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0

We solve for t:
Try integer roots: t=1 => 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 (no)
 t=2 => 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 (yes)

So t = 2.

Then z = 23 / (2^2) = 23 / 4 = 5.75

Now s = x + y + z = 2 + 2 + 5.75 = 9.75

Then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (9.75)^2 - 54 = 95.0625 - 54 = 41.0625

The radius squared is r^2 = (1/4)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 41.0625 / 4 = 10.265625

Convert 41.0625 to fraction:
41.0625 = 41 + 1/16 = (656/16) + (1/16) = 657/16

So r^2 = (657/16) / 4 = 657 / 64

p = 657, q = 64

p + q = 657 + 64 = 721
