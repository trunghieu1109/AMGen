proposed answer: To find the number of intersections of the graphs of the given equations, we need to analyze the functions involved. First, consider the function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. This function takes the absolute value of x, subtracts 1/2, and then takes the absolute value again. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is similar, but with 1/4 instead of 1/2. The function f(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0.5 and is symmetric about x = 0.5. The function g(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0.25 and is symmetric about x = 0.25. Now, consider the composition g(f(x)). The function f(x) will map x to a value between 0 and 0.5, and then g will map this to a value between 0 and 0.25. The function 4g(f(x)) will scale this by 4, resulting in a range from 0 to 1. Now, consider the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The function sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1, and cos(3πy) also ranges from -1 to 1. The function f(sin(2πx)) will map this to a range from 0 to 0.5, and g will map this to a range from 0 to 0.25. The function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will map this to a range from 0 to 1. Similarly, 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will map to a range from 0 to 1. The intersections of the graphs occur when y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are equal. This means we need to find the number of solutions to the equation 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both sides range from 0 to 1, we need to find the number of pairs (x, y) such that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The function g(f(x)) is periodic with period 1, so we can consider x and y in the interval [0, 1]. The function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will have a certain number of distinct values in this interval, and similarly for 4g(f(cos(3πy))). We need to count the number of times these values match. By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we find that there are 8 such intersections.
