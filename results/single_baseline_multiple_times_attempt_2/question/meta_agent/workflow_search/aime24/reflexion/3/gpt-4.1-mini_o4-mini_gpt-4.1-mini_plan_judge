Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We seek the number of real solutions (x,y) in one full period rectangle of the two periodic curves y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  A(x) has period 1/2 and on [0,1] contains two full ‘W’-patterns, each of which decomposes into 2 V-shaped ‘triangles,’ giving 2×2=4 triangles per half‐period and hence 8 triangles total on [0,1].  B(y) has period 2/3 and on one period [0,2/3] yields one W-pattern, i.e.	wo V-shaped triangles per period, hence 2 triangles in [0,2/3].  When restricted to the fundamental rectangle x∈[0,1], y∈[0,2/3], the curve y=A(x) has 8 monotonic triangular pieces and the curve x=B(y) has 2 pieces.  Each pair of one monotonic segment of A and one of B intersects exactly twice (once on each crossing), so the total intersections in the fundamental rectangle is 8×2×2=32.  But over x∈[0,1], y∈[0,1] we actually include one and a half periods of B, giving 8 triangles of A×3 triangles of B×2 intersections=48.
