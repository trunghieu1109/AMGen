Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, let's analyze the functions f and g:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Both f and g take a real number, take its absolute value, subtract a constant (1/2 or 1/4), then take the absolute value again.

Next, the given equations are:

1) y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
2) x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

We want to find the number of intersection points of these two graphs, i.e., the number of (x,y) pairs satisfying both equations simultaneously.

Step 1: Understand the range of f and g.

Since f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, and |x| ≥ 0, the inner expression |x| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to infinity.
Taking absolute value again, f(x) ≥ 0.

Similarly for g.

Step 2: Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are bounded between -1 and 1, their absolute values are between 0 and 1.

Step 3: Let's analyze f(sin(2πx)):

Let s = |sin(2πx)| ∈ [0,1]. Then f(sin(2πx)) = |s - 1/2|.

Similarly, f(cos(3πy)) = |c - 1/2| where c = |cos(3πy)| ∈ [0,1].

Step 4: Then g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(|s - 1/2|) = || |s - 1/2| - 1/4|.

Let t = |s - 1/2| ∈ [0,1/2]. Since s ∈ [0,1], the maximum of |s - 1/2| is 1/2.

So t ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then g(t) = |t - 1/4|.

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) = | |s - 1/2| - 1/4|.

Similarly for g(f(cos(3πy))).

Step 5: Define a function h(z) = | |z| - 1/2| - 1/4| for z ∈ [-1,1].

Then the equations become:

1) y = 4 * h(sin(2πx))
2) x = 4 * h(cos(3πy))

Step 6: The function h(z) is symmetric about zero because it depends on |z|.

Let's analyze h(z) for z in [0,1]:

h(z) = | |z| - 1/2| - 1/4| = |z - 1/2| - 1/4|.

For z in [0,1]:
- When z in [0,1/2], |z - 1/2| = 1/2 - z
- When z in [1/2,1], |z - 1/2| = z - 1/2

Then h(z) = |(1/2 - z) - 1/4| = |1/4 - z| for z in [0,1/2]
and h(z) = |(z - 1/2) - 1/4| = |z - 3/4| for z in [1/2,1]

So h(z) =
- |1/4 - z| for z in [0,1/2]
- |z - 3/4| for z in [1/2,1]

Step 7: The range of h(z) is from 0 to 3/4.

Step 8: Now, y = 4 * h(sin(2πx)) and x = 4 * h(cos(3πy))

Since h(z) ≤ 3/4, 4 * h(z) ≤ 3.

Therefore, x and y are in [-3,3].

Step 9: We want to find the number of solutions (x,y) to the system:

y = 4 * h(sin(2πx))
x = 4 * h(cos(3πy))

Step 10: Because of the symmetry and periodicity, let's consider the possible values of h(sin(2πx)) and h(cos(3πy)) and the corresponding x,y.

Step 11: The function h(z) has 'V' shapes with minima at z=1/4 and z=3/4.

Step 12: The function y = 4 * h(sin(2πx)) is periodic with period 1 in x because sin(2πx) has period 1.

Similarly, x = 4 * h(cos(3πy)) is periodic in y with period 2/3 because cos(3πy) has period 2/3.

Step 13: The intersection points correspond to fixed points of the map:

(x,y) -> (4 * h(cos(3πy)), 4 * h(sin(2πx)))

Step 14: To find the number of intersections, we can consider the possible values of h(sin(2πx)) and h(cos(3πy)) and count the number of solutions.

Step 15: The function h(z) takes values in [0,3/4], and the function 4*h(z) takes values in [0,3].

Step 16: The function 4*h(sin(2πx)) has 8 linear pieces in one period (since h is piecewise linear with 2 pieces, and sin(2πx) is sinusoidal).

Step 17: Similarly for 4*h(cos(3πy)).

Step 18: The system is symmetric and the graphs intersect at points where x and y satisfy the equations.

Step 19: By analyzing the piecewise linearity and periodicity, the number of intersection points in the domain [-3,3] x [-3,3] is 25.

This is because the functions create a grid of possible intersection points at multiples of 1/4 and 3/4 scaled by 4, leading to 5 possible values for x and y each, and thus 5*5=25 intersection points.

Therefore, the number of intersections is 25.
