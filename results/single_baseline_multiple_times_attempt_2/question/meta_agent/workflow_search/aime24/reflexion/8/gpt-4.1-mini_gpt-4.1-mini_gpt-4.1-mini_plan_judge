Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who removes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. This means that for these values of n, the starting position is a losing position for Alice (the first player).

Let's analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions:
- A position is losing if the player to move has no winning moves.
- A position is winning if the player to move can move to a losing position.

Define P(n) as the position with n tokens remaining, and the player to move is about to play.

Base cases:
- P(0): no tokens left, so the player to move cannot move, so P(0) is losing.

For n > 0:
- P(n) is winning if there exists a move removing 1 or 4 tokens that leads to a losing position.
- P(n) is losing if all moves lead to winning positions.

Let's compute P(n) for small n:

P(0): losing
P(1): can remove 1 -> P(0) losing, so P(1) winning
P(2): can remove 1 -> P(1) winning, can remove 4 (not possible), so all moves lead to winning positions, so P(2) losing
P(3): can remove 1 -> P(2) losing, so P(3) winning
P(4): can remove 1 -> P(3) winning, can remove 4 -> P(0) losing, so P(4) winning
P(5): can remove 1 -> P(4) winning, can remove 4 -> P(1) winning, all moves lead to winning positions, so P(5) losing

So far:
P(0): L
P(1): W
P(2): L
P(3): W
P(4): W
P(5): L

Let's continue a bit more:
P(6): remove 1 -> P(5) L, so W
P(7): remove 1 -> P(6) W, remove 4 -> P(3) W, all moves lead to W, so L
P(8): remove 1 -> P(7) L, so W
P(9): remove 1 -> P(8) W, remove 4 -> P(5) L, so W
P(10): remove 1 -> P(9) W, remove 4 -> P(6) W, all moves lead to W, so L

Positions:
0:L
1:W
2:L
3:W
4:W
5:L
6:W
7:L
8:W
9:W
10:L

We see a pattern of losing positions at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10.

Check differences between losing positions:
0 -> 2 (+2)
2 -> 5 (+3)
5 -> 7 (+2)
7 -> 10 (+3)

Pattern of losing positions seems to be: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, ... alternating +2 and +3.

Let's verify next few losing positions:
From 10, +2 = 12
Check P(12): remove 1 -> P(11), remove 4 -> P(8)
We need P(11) and P(8):
P(8) = W (from above)
P(11): remove 1 -> P(10) L, so P(11) W
So moves from P(12): remove 1 -> P(11) W, remove 4 -> P(8) W, all moves lead to W, so P(12) L
Matches pattern.

From 12, +3 = 15
Check P(15): remove 1 -> P(14), remove 4 -> P(11)
P(11) = W
P(14): remove 1 -> P(13), remove 4 -> P(10)
P(10) = L
P(13): remove 1 -> P(12) L, so P(13) W
So P(14): moves to P(13) W and P(10) L, so P(14) W
So from P(15): moves to P(14) W and P(11) W, all moves lead to W, so P(15) L
Matches pattern.

So losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...

This sequence can be described as:
- Start at 0
- Add 2, then add 3, then add 2, then add 3, and so on alternately.

Let's write a formula for the k-th losing position (starting from k=0):
L(0) = 0
L(1) = 2
L(2) = 5
L(3) = 7
L(4) = 10
L(5) = 12
L(6) = 15
L(7) = 17

We can separate into even and odd indices:
For even k = 2m:
L(0) = 0
L(2) = 5
L(4) = 10
L(6) = 15
L(8) = 20
This is an arithmetic sequence: L(2m) = 5m

For odd k = 2m+1:
L(1) = 2
L(3) = 7
L(5) = 12
L(7) = 17
L(9) = 22
This is also arithmetic: L(2m+1) = 5m + 2

So the losing positions are:
L(k) = 5 * floor(k/2) + 2 * (k mod 2)

We want to find all n ≤ 2024 such that n is a losing position (excluding 0 since n is positive).

So n in {2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...} ≤ 2024

Count how many such n are ≤ 2024.

We can count separately for even and odd k:
- For even k=2m: L(2m) = 5m ≤ 2024 => m ≤ 404.8 => m ≤ 404
- For odd k=2m+1: L(2m+1) = 5m + 2 ≤ 2024 => 5m ≤ 2022 => m ≤ 404.4 => m ≤ 404

Number of even k losing positions with n ≤ 2024 is m=0 to 404 => 405 positions
Number of odd k losing positions with n ≤ 2024 is m=0 to 404 => 405 positions

Total losing positions (positive n) ≤ 2024 is 405 + 405 = 810

Therefore, there are 810 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy (i.e., the starting position is losing for Alice).
