Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the losing positions for the subtraction game where on each move you remove 1 or 4 tokens. A position is losing iff all moves lead to winning positions. Compute small values: 0(L),1(W),2(L),3(W),4(W),5(L),… and find losing positions at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,… The differences alternate 2 and 3, so n is losing exactly when n mod 5 is 0 or 2. For positive n ≤ 2024, count n mod 5=0 gives floor(2024/5)=404; n mod 5=2 gives floor((2024−2)/5)+1=405. Total 404+405=809.
