Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Let s be the walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total time for the walk plus coffee break is given in hours and minutes. First, convert all times to hours for consistency. The first scenario: total time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time. Walking time = 9/s hours, coffee time = t/60 hours. So, 9/s + t/60 = 4. The second scenario: total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Walking time = 9/(s+2), coffee time = t/60. So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. We have two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract the second from the first: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6. Find s: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Multiply both sides by s(s+2): 9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6 s (s+2). Simplify left: 9s + 18 - 9s = 18. So, 18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s. Rearranged: 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0. Divide by 1.6: s^2 + 2 s - 11.25 = 0. Solve quadratic: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2. Two solutions: (5/2) = 2.5 or (-9/2) = -4.5 (discard negative speed). So s = 2.5 km/h. Find t: from 9/s + t/60 = 4, 9/2.5 + t/60 = 4, 3.6 + t/60 = 4, t/60 = 0.4, t = 24 minutes. Now, find total time when speed is s + 0.5 = 3 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes. So the total time including coffee break is 204 minutes.
