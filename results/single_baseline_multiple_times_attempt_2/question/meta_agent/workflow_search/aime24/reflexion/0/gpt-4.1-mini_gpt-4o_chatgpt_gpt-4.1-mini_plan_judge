Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find Aya's walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. We have two scenarios: when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, and when she walks at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. First, convert 2 hours and 24 minutes to hours: 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. The time spent walking at speed s is 9/s hours, and the time spent walking at speed s+2 is 9/(s+2) hours. The time spent in the coffee shop, t, is the same in both cases. Therefore, we have the equations: 9/s + t = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t = 2.4. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find s = 3 km/h and t = 1 hour. Now, if Aya walks at speed s+1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Converting this to minutes, we find the walking time is 154.2857 minutes. Including the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 214.2857 minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.
