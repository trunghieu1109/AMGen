    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BxDG (yourself):
We seek all rectangles whose sides lie on sides or diagonals of a regular 12-gon.  Any rectangle must have its two “horizontal” sides on a family of parallel diagonals of one chord-difference k and its two “vertical” sides on the perpendicular family (difference k′ with k′≡k+4 mod 12).  The only k in 1…5 that gives k′ in 1…6 and two distinct parallel chords is k=1 paired with k′=4, and k=2 paired with k′=5.  For each of these two direction-pairs, there are 6 choices of one opposite–chord pair in the first family and 6 in the second, giving 6·6=36 rectangles per direction-pair.  Hence total rectangles =36+36=72.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BxDG (yourself):
72

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent mHg2:
The chain of thought only counted rectangles from pairs of distinct chord‐length families (k=1&amp;5 and k=2&amp;4) but overlooked the case k=m=3.  The “every third vertex” diagonals (difference 3) form three 3×3 squares, giving 72+3=75 rectangles in all.

    <pre>We classify rectangles by selecting two sets of parallel diagonals (including sides) whose directions differ by 90°. In a regular 12-gon, diagonals connecting vertices i to i+k yield 12 lines in 6 parallel‐line classes. A chord‐difference k is perpendicular to difference k+6 (mod 12). Distinct pairs are (k,k′)=(1,5) and (2,4), each giving 6 choices of one parallel‐class from family k and 6 from family k′, for 6×6=36 rectangles per pair, totaling 72. The remaining case k=k′=3 yields diagonals of difference 3: there are 6 directions, and among these 3 perpendicular orientation–pairs, each determines exactly one rectangle (using the two lines in each of the two perpendicular classes), giving 3 more. Hence total =72+3=75.
