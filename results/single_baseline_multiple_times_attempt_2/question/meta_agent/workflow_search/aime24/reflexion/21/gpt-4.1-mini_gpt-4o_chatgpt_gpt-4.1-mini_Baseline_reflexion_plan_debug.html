    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent w6lb (yourself):
To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be used to form these parallel sides. We can choose two opposite vertices to form one pair of parallel sides, and then choose another two opposite vertices to form the other pair of parallel sides. The number of ways to choose two opposite vertices from 12 vertices is 6, because there are 6 pairs of opposite vertices. Once we choose one pair of opposite vertices, we have 5 remaining pairs to choose from for the second pair of opposite vertices. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 6 * 5 = 30.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent w6lb (yourself):
30

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent zFmx:
The reasoning is incorrect. The solution overcounts the rectangles by considering each pair of opposite vertices independently. In a regular dodecagon, rectangles can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, but the sides must be equidistant from each other. The correct approach is to consider the symmetry and spacing of the vertices. For a regular dodecagon, rectangles can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices that are evenly spaced. The correct number of rectangles is 9, as each rectangle corresponds to a pair of opposite sides and a pair of opposite diagonals that are evenly spaced.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
