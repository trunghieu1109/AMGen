Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: We classify rectangles by selecting two sets of parallel diagonals (including sides) whose directions differ by 90°. In a regular 12-gon, diagonals connecting vertices i to i+k yield 12 lines in 6 parallel‐line classes. A chord‐difference k is perpendicular to difference k+6 (mod 12). Distinct pairs are (k,k′)=(1,5) and (2,4), each giving 6 choices of one parallel‐class from family k and 6 from family k′, for 6×6=36 rectangles per pair, totaling 72. The remaining case k=k′=3 yields diagonals of difference 3: there are 6 directions, and among these 3 perpendicular orientation–pairs, each determines exactly one rectangle (using the two lines in each of the two perpendicular classes), giving 3 more. Hence total =72+3=75.
