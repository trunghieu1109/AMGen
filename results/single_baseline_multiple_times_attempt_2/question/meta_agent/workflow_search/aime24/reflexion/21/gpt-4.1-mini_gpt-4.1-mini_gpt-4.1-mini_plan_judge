proposed answer: We are given a regular dodecagon (12-gon) and need to find the number of rectangles formed such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The vertices of the dodecagon are equally spaced on a circle, and the sides and diagonals are chords connecting these vertices.

Key observations:
1. The dodecagon is regular, so its vertices lie on a circle, and the polygon is symmetric.
2. Rectangles inscribed in a circle are special: all rectangles inscribed in a circle are cyclic quadrilaterals with right angles.
3. For a rectangle to have its sides on sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, its vertices must be vertices of the dodecagon.
4. Since the dodecagon is regular, the vertices are equally spaced at 30 degrees apart (360/12 = 30).

Step 1: Characterize rectangles inscribed in a regular polygon.
- A rectangle inscribed in a circle has vertices that are pairs of points that are opposite each other on the circle.
- For a rectangle, the vertices come in pairs of opposite points on the circle.

Step 2: Find all rectangles formed by vertices of the dodecagon.
- The vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.
- Opposite vertices are separated by 180°.
- The pairs of opposite vertices are (0°,180°), (30°,210°), (60°,240°), (90°,270°), (120°,300°), (150°,330°).

Step 3: To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of opposite vertices that form the rectangle's corners.
- Each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices.
- The rectangle's vertices are these four points.

Step 4: Count the number of rectangles.
- There are 6 pairs of opposite vertices.
- To form a rectangle, choose any 2 pairs out of these 6 pairs.
- Number of rectangles = C(6,2) = 15.

Step 5: Verify that each rectangle's sides lie on sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.
- Since the rectangle's vertices are vertices of the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle are chords connecting these vertices.
- These chords are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.
- Therefore, all these rectangles satisfy the condition.

Hence, the number of rectangles is 15.
