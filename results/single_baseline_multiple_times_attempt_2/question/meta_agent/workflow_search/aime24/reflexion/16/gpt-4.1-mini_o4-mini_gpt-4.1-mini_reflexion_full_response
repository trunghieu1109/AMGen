Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kWqD', content='We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O (circumradius R=13) and incenter I (inradius r=6), and IA ⟂ OI.  We use the following facts:\n\n1.  Euler’s formula for the distance OI:  OI^2 = R(R−2r) = 13(13−12) = 13, so OI = √13.\n2.  Because IA ⟂ OI, triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so AO^2 = AI^2 + OI^2.  But AO = R = 13, and AI = r/ sin(A/2).  Thus\n   13^2 = (r/ sin(A/2))^2 + OI^2  ⇒ 169 = (6/ sin(A/2))^2 + 13  ⇒ 156 = 36/ sin^2(A/2)\n   ⇒ sin^2(A/2) = 36/156 = 3/13  ⇒ sin(A/2)=√(3/13),  cos(A/2)=√(10/13).\n3.  Then tan(A/2)=√(3/10).  A standard half‐angle formula gives tan(A/2) = r/(s−a), where a=BC and s = semiperimeter.  So\n   s−a = r/ tan(A/2) = 6/ (√(3/10)) = 6√(10/3) = 2√30.\n   Hence s = a + 2√30.\n4.  Also sinA = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2·√(3/13)·√(10/13) = 2√30/13.  By the extended law of sines, a = 2R sinA = 26·(2√30/13) = 4√30.\n5.  The product bc = AB·AC can be found via the area K.  We have K = rs = 6(a+2√30) and also K = ½·bc·sinA = ½·bc·(2√30/13) = bc·√30/13.  Equate:\n   bc·√30/13 = 6(a+2√30)  ⇒  bc = 13·6(a+2√30)/√30 = 78(a+2√30)/√30.\n   Substitute a = 4√30:  bc = 78(4√30+2√30)/√30 = 78·6√30/√30 = 78·6 = 468.\n\nTherefore AB·AC = 468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
