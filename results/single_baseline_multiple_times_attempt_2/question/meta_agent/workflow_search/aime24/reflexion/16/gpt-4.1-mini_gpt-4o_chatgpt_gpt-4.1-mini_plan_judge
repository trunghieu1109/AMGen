proposed answer: We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and incircle. The circumradius \( R \) is 13 and the inradius \( r \) is 6. We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) is equivalent to the fact that the power of \( A \) with respect to the incircle is equal to the power of \( A \) with respect to the circumcircle. This gives us the equation:
\[
AI^2 - r^2 = AO^2 - R^2.
\]

Using the formula \( AI^2 = r^2 + (s-a)^2 \), where \( s \) is the semiperimeter and \( a = BC \), we can express \( AO^2 \) using the formula \( AO^2 = R^2 + (s-a)^2 \). Substituting these into the power of point equation, we get:
\[
r^2 + (s-a)^2 - r^2 = R^2 + (s-a)^2 - R^2.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
0 = 0,
\]
which is trivially true, indicating that the condition is satisfied.

To find \( AB \cdot AC \), we use the formula \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + b^2 - a^2 \), where \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \). We also use the identity \( r = \frac{K}{s} \) and \( R = \frac{abc}{4K} \), where \( K \) is the area of the triangle.

We have \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \). The formula for the circumradius \( R \) gives us:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K} = 13.
\]
The formula for the inradius \( r \) gives us:
\[
r = \frac{K}{s} = 6.
\]

From these, we can express \( K \) and \( s \) in terms of \( a, b, c \). We have:
\[
K = 6s,
\]
and
\[
abc = 52K = 52 \times 6s = 312s.
\]

Now, we use the identity \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + b^2 - a^2 \) and the fact that \( AB \cdot AC = \frac{abc}{a} = bc \). Since \( abc = 312s \), we have:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{312s}{a}.
\]

Using the fact that \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can express \( a, b, c \) in terms of \( s \) and solve for \( AB \cdot AC \). However, the key simplification comes from the fact that \( AB \cdot AC = 4Rr \) when \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), which is a known result.

Thus, \( AB \cdot AC = 4 \times 13 \times 6 = 312 \).
