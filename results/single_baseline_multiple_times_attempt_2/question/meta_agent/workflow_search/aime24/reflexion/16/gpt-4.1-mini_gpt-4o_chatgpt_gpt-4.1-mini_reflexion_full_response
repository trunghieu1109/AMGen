Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zCet', content='We are given a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that \\( A \\) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and incircle. The circumradius \\( R \\) is 13 and the inradius \\( r \\) is 6. We need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\nThe condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) is equivalent to the fact that the power of \\( A \\) with respect to the incircle is equal to the power of \\( A \\) with respect to the circumcircle. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\nAI^2 - r^2 = AO^2 - R^2.\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula \\( AI^2 = r^2 + (s-a)^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter and \\( a = BC \\), we can express \\( AO^2 \\) using the formula \\( AO^2 = R^2 + (s-a)^2 \\). Substituting these into the power of point equation, we get:\n\\[\nr^2 + (s-a)^2 - r^2 = R^2 + (s-a)^2 - R^2.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n0 = 0,\n\\]\nwhich is trivially true, indicating that the condition is satisfied.\n\nTo find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\), we use the formula \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + b^2 - a^2 \\), where \\( a = BC \\), \\( b = CA \\), and \\( c = AB \\). We also use the identity \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) and \\( R = \\frac{abc}{4K} \\), where \\( K \\) is the area of the triangle.\n\nWe have \\( R = 13 \\) and \\( r = 6 \\). The formula for the circumradius \\( R \\) gives us:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4K} = 13.\n\\]\nThe formula for the inradius \\( r \\) gives us:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{K}{s} = 6.\n\\]\n\nFrom these, we can express \\( K \\) and \\( s \\) in terms of \\( a, b, c \\). We have:\n\\[\nK = 6s,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nabc = 52K = 52 \\times 6s = 312s.\n\\]\n\nNow, we use the identity \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + b^2 - a^2 \\) and the fact that \\( AB \\cdot AC = \\frac{abc}{a} = bc \\). Since \\( abc = 312s \\), we have:\n\\[\nAB \\cdot AC = \\frac{312s}{a}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the fact that \\( s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2} \\), we can express \\( a, b, c \\) in terms of \\( s \\) and solve for \\( AB \\cdot AC \\). However, the key simplification comes from the fact that \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4Rr \\) when \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), which is a known result.\n\nThus, \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4 \\times 13 \\times 6 = 312 \\).\n\nAnswer:312', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
