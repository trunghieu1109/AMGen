    <pre>Given triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, we know the circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. We are also given that IA is perpendicular to OI. We want to find the product AB * AC.

Step 1: Understand the given condition IA ⟂ OI.

Since I is the incenter, it lies inside the triangle. O is the circumcenter. The segment IA is from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is from circumcenter to incenter.

Step 2: Use coordinate geometry or vector approach.

Place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Since the circumradius is 13, the points A, B, C lie on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 169.

Step 3: Let’s place A at coordinates (13, 0) on the circle for convenience.

Step 4: The incenter I lies inside the triangle. The incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors. The incenter I is at a distance r = 6 from each side.

Step 5: The vector OI is from (0,0) to I = (x,y). The vector IA is from I = (x,y) to A = (13,0), so IA = (13 - x, 0 - y).

The condition IA ⟂ OI means their dot product is zero:

(x, y) · (13 - x, -y) = 0

Compute the dot product:

x(13 - x) + y(-y) = 0

13x - x^2 - y^2 = 0

Rearranged:

x^2 + y^2 = 13x

Step 6: Note that x^2 + y^2 = |OI|^2, the squared distance from O to I.

So |OI|^2 = 13x.

Step 7: Use Euler&#39;s formula relating OI, R, and r:

OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

Given R = 13, r = 6:

OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13 * 1 = 13

So |OI|^2 = 13.

Step 8: From step 6, |OI|^2 = 13x, so 13 = 13x =&gt; x = 1.

Step 9: Since |OI|^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 13, and x = 1, then y^2 = 13 - 1 = 12.

So I = (1, sqrt(12)) or (1, -sqrt(12)).

Step 10: Now, we want to find AB * AC.

Step 11: Use the formula for the product of two sides adjacent to A in terms of R, r, and angle A.

Recall the Law of Sines:

AB = 2R sin C
AC = 2R sin B

So AB * AC = (2R)^2 sin B sin C = 4R^2 sin B sin C

Step 12: Use the incenter coordinates to find angle A.

Since A is at (13,0), and I is at (1, sqrt(12)), vector IA = (1 - 13, sqrt(12) - 0) = (-12, sqrt(12))

Step 13: The incenter lies on the angle bisector of angle A, so vector IA bisects angle A.

Step 14: The vectors AB and AC lie on the circle centered at O(0,0) with radius 13.

Let’s denote vectors:

OA = (13,0)

OB = (13 cos θ, 13 sin θ)

OC = (13 cos φ, 13 sin φ)

Angle A is the angle at vertex A between points B and C.

Step 15: The angle bisector at A is the vector IA.

The angle bisector direction is the average of unit vectors AB and AC.

Vectors AB = OB - OA = (13 cos θ - 13, 13 sin θ - 0) = 13 (cos θ - 1, sin θ)

Vectors AC = OC - OA = 13 (cos φ - 1, sin φ)

Unit vectors along AB and AC are:

u_AB = (cos θ - 1, sin θ) / |(cos θ - 1, sin θ)|

u_AC = (cos φ - 1, sin φ) / |(cos φ - 1, sin φ)|

The angle bisector direction is proportional to u = u_AB + u_AC.

Step 16: The vector IA is (-12, sqrt(12)) = (-12, 2*sqrt(3))

We can normalize IA to get the direction of the angle bisector.

Step 17: To simplify, assume the triangle is isosceles with AB = AC.

Then θ = -φ (symmetric about x-axis), so sin φ = -sin θ, cos φ = cos θ.

Then u_AB + u_AC = 2 * (cos θ - 1, 0) because sin θ + sin(-θ) = 0.

But IA has a positive y component, so the triangle is not isosceles with AB=AC.

Step 18: Instead, use the formula for AB * AC in terms of R, r, and angle A.

Recall the formula:

r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

But this is complicated.

Step 19: Use the formula for AB * AC in terms of R and angle A:

AB * AC = (2R)^2 sin B sin C = 4R^2 sin B sin C

Also, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°

Step 20: Use the formula for the distance OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13

Step 21: Use the formula for OI^2 in terms of R and angle A:

OI^2 = R^2 (1 - 2r/R) = 13

Step 22: Use the formula for the distance from incenter to vertex A:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Given IA is perpendicular to OI, and we have coordinates for I and A, we can find IA length:

IA = sqrt((-12)^2 + (2*sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(144 + 12) = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Step 23: So IA = 2*sqrt(39)

Step 24: Using IA = r / sin(A/2), we get:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3 sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39) / 13

Step 25: Then sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13

Step 26: Use the formula for AB * AC:

AB * AC = 4R^2 sin B sin C

But sin B sin C = sin((180° - A)/2 + x) sin((180° - A)/2 - x) = sin^2((180° - A)/2) - sin^2 x

This is complicated.

Step 27: Use the formula for AB * AC in terms of R and angle A:

AB * AC = R^2 (1 - cos A)

This is a known formula from the Law of Cosines applied to triangle ABC with circumradius R:

AB * AC = R^2 (1 - cos A)

Step 28: Find cos A using sin(A/2):

sin^2(A/2) + cos^2(A/2) = 1

cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt((169 - 39)/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13

Step 29: cos A = 2 cos^2(A/2) - 1 = 2 * (130/169) - 1 = (260/169) - 1 = (260 - 169)/169 = 91/169

Step 30: Then AB * AC = R^2 (1 - cos A) = 13^2 (1 - 91/169) = 169 * (78/169) = 78
