proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We start by considering the condition n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For this to happen, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. First, we check small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 is either 0 or 1 mod 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 2 works since 2^4 + 1 = 17, and 17 ≡ 0 (mod 9). Therefore, p = 3 is the smallest prime. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 9. We test small values of m: m = 2 gives 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, the smallest m is 2.
