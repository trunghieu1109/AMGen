Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dUv9', content='We seek the smallest prime p such that n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution.  A necessary condition is that –1 is a fourth power mod p, so p≡1 mod 8.  The smallest such odd prime is p=17.  Check mod 17: 2^4+1≡0 mod 17 and the derivative 4⋅2^3≠0 mod 17, so by Hensel’s lemma that root lifts uniquely to mod 17^2=289.  Writing n=2+17k, we expand n^4+1≡(2^4+1)+68⋅2^3k mod 289 ≡17+544k≡17+255k mod 289, and solve 255k≡−17 mod 289.  Dividing by gcd(255,289)=17 reduces to 15k≡16 mod 17 ⇒ k≡9 ⇒ n≡155 mod 289.  Similarly lifting the other three roots mod 17 (2,\u200915,\u20098,\u20099) gives four roots mod 289: 110,\u2009134,\u2009155,\u2009179, among which the smallest positive is 110.  Therefore the least m is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
