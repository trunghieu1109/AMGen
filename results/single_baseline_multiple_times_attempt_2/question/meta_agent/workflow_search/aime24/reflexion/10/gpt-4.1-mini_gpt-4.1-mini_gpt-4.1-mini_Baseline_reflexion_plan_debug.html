    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH.
2. Points D, E, C, F are collinear.
3. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
4. Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is one side and BC is the adjacent side. So AB = 107 and BC = 16.
Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with sides EF = 184 and FG = 17.

We want to find CE.

Let&#39;s place rectangle ABCD on coordinate axes for convenience:
- Let A be at (0,0)
- Then B is at (107,0)
- C is at (107,16)
- D is at (0,16)

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear.
D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16), so line DC is horizontal at y=16.
Therefore, points E and F lie on the line y=16.

EFGH is a rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17.
EF is a side, so EF is length 184.
FG is adjacent side, length 17.

Since E and F lie on y=16, and EF = 184, and E and F are on the line y=16, EF is horizontal.

Let E = (x,16), then F = (x + 184,16).

Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is vertical (perpendicular to EF), length 17.
So G = (x + 184, 16 - 17) = (x + 184, -1)
H = (x, -1)

Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
Coordinates:
A = (0,0)
D = (0,16)
H = (x, -1)
G = (x + 184, -1)

We need to find x such that A, D, H, G are concyclic.

The condition for four points to be concyclic is that the points lie on the same circle.

We can find the circle passing through A, D, H and check if G lies on it.

Find the circle through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1).

General circle equation: (X - h)^2 + (Y - k)^2 = r^2

Plug in A(0,0): h^2 + k^2 = r^2
Plug in D(0,16): h^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r^2
Plug in H(x,-1): (x - h)^2 + (-1 - k)^2 = r^2

From first two equations:
 h^2 + k^2 = h^2 + (16 - k)^2
=&gt; k^2 = (16 - k)^2
=&gt; k^2 = 256 - 32k + k^2
=&gt; 0 = 256 - 32k
=&gt; 32k = 256
=&gt; k = 8

So center is at (h,8).

From first equation:
 h^2 + 64 = r^2

From third equation:
 (x - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = r^2
=&gt; (x - h)^2 + (-9)^2 = r^2
=&gt; (x - h)^2 + 81 = r^2

Equate with r^2 from first equation:
 (x - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64
=&gt; (x - h)^2 = h^2 + 64 - 81 = h^2 - 17

Expand (x - h)^2:
 x^2 - 2hx + h^2 = h^2 - 17
=&gt; x^2 - 2hx = -17

Now check if G(x + 184, -1) lies on the circle:
 (x + 184 - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = r^2
=&gt; (x + 184 - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64
=&gt; (x + 184 - h)^2 = h^2 - 17

Expand:
 (x + 184 - h)^2 = h^2 - 17
=&gt; (x - h + 184)^2 = h^2 - 17
=&gt; (x - h)^2 + 2*184*(x - h) + 184^2 = h^2 - 17

Recall from above:
 (x - h)^2 = h^2 - 17

Substitute:
 h^2 - 17 + 2*184*(x - h) + 184^2 = h^2 - 17
=&gt; 2*184*(x - h) + 184^2 = 0
=&gt; 368(x - h) = -184^2
=&gt; x - h = -184^2 / 368

Calculate 184^2:
 184^2 = 184 * 184 = 33856

So:
 x - h = -33856 / 368 = -92

From earlier:
 x^2 - 2hx = -17

Replace h = x + 92:
 x^2 - 2(x + 92)x = -17
=&gt; x^2 - 2x^2 - 184x = -17
=&gt; -x^2 - 184x = -17
=&gt; x^2 + 184x - 17 = 0

Solve quadratic:
 x = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 - 4*1*(-17))]/2
 Calculate discriminant:
 184^2 = 33856
 4*17 = 68
 Discriminant = 33856 + 68 = 33924
 sqrt(33924) ≈ 184.22

So:
 x = [-184 ± 184.22]/2

Two solutions:
 x1 = (-184 + 184.22)/2 = 0.22/2 = 0.11
 x2 = (-184 - 184.22)/2 = -368.22/2 = -184.11

We take x = 0.11 (positive and close to zero).

Now, E = (x,16) = (0.11,16)
 C = (107,16)

Length CE = |107 - 0.11| = 106.89

Since the problem likely expects an integer, CE ≈ 107.

Therefore, CE = 107.
