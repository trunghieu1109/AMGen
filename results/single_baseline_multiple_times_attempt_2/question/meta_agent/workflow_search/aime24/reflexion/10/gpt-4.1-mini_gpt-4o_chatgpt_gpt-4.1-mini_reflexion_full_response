Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SbFa', content='We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G are on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between C and E along the line. We know BC = 16 and FG = 17. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the total length from C to E is the sum of BC and FG.\n\nAnswer:33', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

We need to find CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between C and E along the line. We know BC = 16 and FG = 17, and since D, E, C, F are collinear, the total length from C to E is the sum of BC and FG.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SbFa (yourself):\n33\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent JD8V:\nThe reasoning assumes that CE is simply the sum of BC and FG, but this is incorrect. The collinearity of D, E, C, F does not imply that CE is the sum of BC and FG. The problem requires a different approach to find CE.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.'}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
