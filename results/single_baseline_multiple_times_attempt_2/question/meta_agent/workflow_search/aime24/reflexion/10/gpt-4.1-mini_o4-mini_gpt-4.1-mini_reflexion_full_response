Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sdDq', content='We set ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0),C=(107,16),D=(0,16). The line DC is y=16, so E and F lie on y=16. Let E=(x_E,16), F=(x_E+184,16). The rectangle EFGH extends vertically by 17, so H=(x_E,16+17), G=(x_E+184,16+17). Requiring A,D,H,G concyclic gives a quadratic in x_E whose discriminant forces the vertical shift to be +17 and yields x_E=3 or -187. The configuration with D–E–C–F in order gives x_E=3, so CE=|107−3|=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
