Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G are on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between C and E along the line. We know BC = 16 and FG = 17. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the total length from C to E is the sum of BC and FG.
