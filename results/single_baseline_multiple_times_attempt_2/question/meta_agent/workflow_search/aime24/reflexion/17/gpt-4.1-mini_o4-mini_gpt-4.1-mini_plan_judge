Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We rewrite the given symmetric sum S=a^2b+a^2c+b^2a+b^2c+c^2a+c^2b as ab(a+b)+bc(b+c)+ca(c+a). Noting a+b+c=300, one shows S=300(ab+bc+ca)−3abc, so the equation S=6,000,000 becomes 100(ab+bc+ca)−abc=2,000,000, i.e.
    abc = 100(ab+bc+ca)−2,000,000.
One finds that all integer solutions lie on the one‐parameter family of multisets {k,100,200−k} for 0≤k≤200.  Distinct unordered triples occur for 0≤k≤100, giving 101 multisets, of which 100 have three distinct entries (each yields 6 ordered permutations) and one is (100,100,100) (1 ordering).  Hence the total number of ordered nonnegative solutions is 100·6+1=601.
