Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FFzK', content='We are given nonnegative integers (a,b,c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, rewrite the second equation. Notice that a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substitute these: expression = a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This expands to 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. We also know a + b + c = 300. We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying these. Let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, S3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3. The equation is 300 S2 - S3 = 6,000,000. We want to find all (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers summing to 300 and satisfying this. Try to find a pattern or simplify. Note that S3 can be expressed in terms of symmetric sums, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, try to find possible values of (a,b,c) by guessing or using the symmetry. Since the problem is symmetric in a,b,c, try to find solutions where two variables are equal or one is zero. Try a = b = c = 100: then a + b + c = 300. Compute the expression: a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) = 100^2*(100+100) + 100^2*(100+100) + 100^2*(100+100) = 10000*200*3 = 6,000,000. So (100,100,100) is a solution. Now try to find other solutions. Try a = b = x, c = 300 - 2x. Then expression = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) = x^2(x + 300 - 2x) + x^2(x + 300 - 2x) + (300 - 2x)^2(x + x) = 2 x^2 (300 - x) + (300 - 2x)^2 (2x). Set this equal to 6,000,000 and solve for integer x in [0,150]. Check integer values of x to find solutions. By testing, solutions are x=100 (which gives c=100), and also x=0 (c=300), x=150 (c=0). Check these: For x=0, c=300, expression = 0 + 0 + 300^2*(0+0) = 0, no. For x=150, c=0, expression = 2*150^2*(300-150) + 0 = 2*22500*150 = 6,750,000 > 6,000,000. So no. So only x=100 works. So the only triple with two equal variables is (100,100,100). Now try a=0, b=x, c=300 - x. Then expression = 0 + 0 + c^2(a+b) + b^2(a+c) = b^2 c + c^2 b = b c (b + c) = b c (300). So expression = 300 b c = 6,000,000 => b c = 20,000. Since b + c = 300, find integer pairs (b,c) with b + c = 300 and b c = 20,000. The quadratic equation for b is b(300 - b) = 20,000 => 300 b - b^2 = 20,000 => b^2 - 300 b + 20,000 = 0. The discriminant is 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. sqrt(10,000) = 100. So b = (300 Â± 100)/2 = 200 or 100. So pairs are (100,200) and (200,100). So (0,100,200) and (0,200,100) are solutions. By symmetry, also (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (200,100,0) are solutions. So 6 solutions here. Now try a=0, b=0, c=300: expression = 0. No. So no other solutions with zeros. Now try a=b=c=100 is one solution. Try a=b=c is the only triple with all equal. Now try a=b, c=300-2a, and check for other integer solutions. We found only a=100 works. Now try a=0, b=c=150: expression = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) = 0 + 150^2*(0+150) + 150^2*(0+150) = 22500*150 + 22500*150 = 6,750,000 > 6,000,000. No. So no. Now try a=1, b=1, c=298: expression = 1^2*(1+298) + 1^2*(1+298) + 298^2*(1+1) = 1*299 + 1*299 + 88804*2 = 299 + 299 + 177,608 = 178,206 << 6,000,000. So no. So the only solutions are (100,100,100) and permutations of (0,100,200). Count the number of solutions: (100,100,100) is 1. For (0,100,200), permutations are 3! = 6. Total solutions = 7.\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
