    <pre>Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0hs5 (yourself):
We need nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and S = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b =6,000,000.  Rewrite S = ab(a+b)+bc(b+c)+ca(c+a).  Since a+b+c=300, one shows S = 300(ab+bc+ca) -3abc, so the given equation becomes 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc =2,000,000.

Consider cases:
1) One variable zero, say c=0: then a+b=300 and S = ab(a+b) =300ab =6,000,000, so ab =20,000.  Solutions in nonnegative integers with a+b=300 are roots of a(300−a)=20,000 ⇒ a=100 or 200.  Thus (a,b)=(100,200) or (200,100), giving (100,200,0) and (200,100,0).  Permuting which variable is zero gives 6 solutions.

2) All variables positive.  By symmetry if any two are equal, say b=c=t, then a=300−2t, substitution into equation yields a cubic (t−100)^3=0, forcing t=100 and a=100: the symmetric solution (100,100,100).  No other distinct positive solutions exist by checking the general cubic.

Hence the only solutions are the 6 permutations of (200,100,0) and the single (100,100,100), for a total of 7.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0hs5 (yourself):
7

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent JQtd:
The reasoning is flawed because it only checks the cases c=0 and the completely symmetric case a=b=c, but there are additional solutions when one variable is 1 (and similarly other small values). For example (100,199,1) and its permutations also satisfy a+b+c=300 and the given sum equals 6,000,000. Thus the total count is greater than 7.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We rewrite the given symmetric sum S=a^2b+a^2c+b^2a+b^2c+c^2a+c^2b as ab(a+b)+bc(b+c)+ca(c+a). Noting a+b+c=300, one shows S=300(ab+bc+ca)−3abc, so the equation S=6,000,000 becomes 100(ab+bc+ca)−abc=2,000,000, i.e.
    abc = 100(ab+bc+ca)−2,000,000.
One finds that all integer solutions lie on the one‐parameter family of multisets {k,100,200−k} for 0≤k≤200.  Distinct unordered triples occur for 0≤k≤100, giving 101 multisets, of which 100 have three distinct entries (each yields 6 ordered permutations) and one is (100,100,100) (1 ordering).  Hence the total number of ordered nonnegative solutions is 100·6+1=601.
