Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sy8m', content='We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0).  Then A satisfies AB=5, AC=10, giving A=(1/3,4√14/3).  The circumcircle center O is found via perpendicular bisectors, but we instead compute D, the intersection of tangents at B and C.  Tangent at B has slope –6√14/11, at C has slope 6√14/11; solving yields D=(9/2, −27√14/11).  Compute distances: DB^2=(225/22)^2, DA=(325/22).  By power of a point from D: DB^2=DA·DP ⇒ DP=2025/286.  Since D, A, P are collinear with A between D and P, AP=DP−DA = 2025/286−(325/22)=100/13.  Thus m+n=100+13=113.\n\nAnswer:113', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
