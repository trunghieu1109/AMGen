Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, we have DB = DC. Also, since AD intersects the circle again at P, by the Power of a Point theorem, we have AD * DP = DB^2. We can use the fact that triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle to find the circumradius R using the formula R = abc / (4K), where K is the area of the triangle. We can find K using Heron's formula. Once we have R, we can find the length of the tangents DB = DC = R * sin(A). Finally, we use the Power of a Point theorem to find AP.
