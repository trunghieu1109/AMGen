Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lDZD', content="To solve this problem, we use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, we have DB = DC. Also, since AD intersects the circle again at P, by the Power of a Point theorem, we have AD * DP = DB^2. We can use the fact that triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle to find the circumradius R using the formula R = abc / (4K), where K is the area of the triangle. We can find K using Heron's formula. Once we have R, we can find the length of the tangents DB = DC = R * sin(A). Finally, we use the Power of a Point theorem to find AP.\n\nAnswer:17", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The Power of a Point theorem should be applied correctly, and the relationship between the tangents and the circle should be used properly. The correct approach involves using the fact that AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC, and using properties of symmedians and the circumcircle.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
