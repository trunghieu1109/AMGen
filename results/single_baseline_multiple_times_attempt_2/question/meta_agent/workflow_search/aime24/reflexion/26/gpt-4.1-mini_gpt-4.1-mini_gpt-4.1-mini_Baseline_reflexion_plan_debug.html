    <pre>Let A be the set of positive integers chosen by Alice. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We want the total number of such sets B to be 2024.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- For each element a in A, consider all finite nonempty sets B whose maximum element is exactly a.
- The sets B are subsets of positive integers, finite and nonempty.
- The maximum element of B is in A.

Step 2: Count the number of sets B for a fixed maximum element a.
- If max(B) = a, then B is a subset of {1, 2, ..., a} that contains a.
- The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} is 2^a.
- The number of subsets that contain a is 2^{a-1} (since for the other a-1 elements, each can be either in or out).

Step 3: Since the maximum element of B must be in A, the total number of such sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

Step 4: Given that the total number of sets B is 2024, we have:
  sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024

Step 5: Express 2024 in terms of powers of 2.
- 2^{10} = 1024
- 2^{11} = 2048
- 2024 is less than 2048, so let&#39;s try to write 2024 as a sum of powers of 2.

Step 6: Find the binary representation of 2024.
- 2024 in binary:
  2024 - 1024 = 1000
  1000 - 512 = 488
  488 - 256 = 232
  232 - 128 = 104
  104 - 64 = 40
  40 - 32 = 8
  8 - 8 = 0

So 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8

These correspond to 2^{10} + 2^{9} + 2^{8} + 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{5} + 2^{3}

Step 7: Recall that sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
- So the exponents a-1 correspond to the powers above.
- Therefore, the set of exponents is {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3}
- Hence, A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}

Step 8: Find the sum of elements of A.
- sum = 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4
- sum = (11 + 10) + (9 + 8) + (7 + 6) + 4
- sum = 21 + 17 + 13 + 4
- sum = 21 + 17 = 38; 38 + 13 = 51; 51 + 4 = 55
