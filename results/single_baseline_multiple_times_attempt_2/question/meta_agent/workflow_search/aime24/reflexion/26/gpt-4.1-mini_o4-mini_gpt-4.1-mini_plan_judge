Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let A be the chosen set. The number of nonempty finite sets B with max(B)=a is 2^{a-1}. Bob’s total is ∑_{a∈A}2^{a-1}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024 = 2^{10}+2^{9}+2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{5}+2^{3}. Hence A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4} and the sum of elements is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.
