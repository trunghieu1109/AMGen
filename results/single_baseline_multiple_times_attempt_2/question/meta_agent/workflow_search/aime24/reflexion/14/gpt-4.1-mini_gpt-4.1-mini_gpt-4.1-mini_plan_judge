Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: Let the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) such that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, if A = (x_1, y_1), then C = (-x_1, -y_1), and if B = (x_2, y_2), then D = (-x_2, -y_2). All points satisfy the hyperbola equation: \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The side length squared of the rhombus is \( AB^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 \), and similarly \( BC^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 + (y_2 + y_1)^2 \). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so \( AB^2 = BC^2 \). This implies \( (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 + (y_1 + y_2)^2 \), which simplifies to \( x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0 \). Thus, the vectors \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are orthogonal in the Euclidean sense. Parameterize the hyperbola as \( x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t, y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t \). Then \( A = (\sqrt{20} \cosh t, \sqrt{24} \sinh t) \) and \( B = (\sqrt{20} \cosh s, \sqrt{24} \sinh s) \). The orthogonality condition becomes \( \sqrt{20}^2 \cosh t \cosh s + \sqrt{24}^2 \sinh t \sinh s = 20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0 \). Using hyperbolic identities, \( 20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0 \) implies \( 20 \cosh t \cosh s = -24 \sinh t \sinh s \). Dividing both sides by \( \cosh t \cosh s \), \( 20 = -24 \tanh t \tanh s \), so \( \tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{5}{6} \). The diagonal BD squared is \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4(20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s) = 4(20 + 4 \sinh^2 s) = 80 + 16 \sinh^2 s \). Using \( \sinh^2 s = \frac{\tanh^2 s}{1 - \tanh^2 s} \), set \( u = \tanh s \), then \( \tanh t = -\frac{5}{6u} \). Since \( |\tanh t| < 1 \), \( | -\frac{5}{6u} | < 1 \) implies \( |u| > \frac{5}{6} \). Also, \( |u| < 1 \) because \( \tanh s \in (-1,1) \). So \( u \in (-1, -\frac{5}{6}) \cup (\frac{5}{6}, 1) \). The function to maximize is \( BD^2 = 80 + 16 \frac{u^2}{1 - u^2} \). As \( u \to \pm 1 \), \( BD^2 \to +\infty \). But the points must lie on the hyperbola, so the parameters are real. The orthogonality condition restricts \( u \) to \( |u| > \frac{5}{6} \). The minimal value of \( BD^2 \) over this domain is at \( u = \pm \frac{5}{6} \), giving \( BD^2 = 80 + 16 \frac{(5/6)^2}{1 - (5/6)^2} = 80 + 16 \frac{25/36}{1 - 25/36} = 80 + 16 \frac{25/36}{11/36} = 80 + 16 \times \frac{25}{11} = 80 + \frac{400}{11} = \frac{880 + 400}{11} = \frac{1280}{11} \approx 116.36 \). Since \( BD^2 \) can be arbitrarily large, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is the minimal possible value of \( BD^2 \), which is \( \frac{1280}{11} \). The problem asks for the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi, i.e., the infimum of \( BD^2 \). Therefore, the answer is \( \left\lfloor \frac{1280}{11} \right\rfloor = 116 \).
