Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We parametrize the rhombus by the slope k of diagonal AC (through the origin). Intersection of line y=kx with the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1 yields x^2 = 120/(6 - 5k^2), so k^2 < 6/5. The perpendicular diagonal y = -x/k meets the hyperbola giving BD^2 = 480(k^2+1)/(6k^2 - 5), requiring k^2 > 5/6. Thus k^2 ∈ (5/6, 6/5). On this interval BD^2 is strictly decreasing in k^2, so its greatest lower bound occurs as k^2 → 6/5, yielding BD^2 → 480. Hence the greatest real number less than all BD^2 is 480.
