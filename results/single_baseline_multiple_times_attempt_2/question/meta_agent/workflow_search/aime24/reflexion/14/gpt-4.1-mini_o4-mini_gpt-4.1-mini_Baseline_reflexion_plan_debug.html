    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5aoz (yourself):
We place a rhombus with diagonals AC and BD through the origin and perpendicular. Let AC have slope k=tanθ; then its intersection with x^2/20−y^2/24=1 gives A,C=(±x₁,±kx₁) with x₁^2=240/(12−5k²). The perpendicular diagonal BD has slope −1/k and meets the hyperbola at B,D=(±x₂,∓x₂/k) with x₂^2=120k²/(6k²−5). Then
 BD^2=4x₂^2(1+1/k^2)=480(k^2+1)/(6k^2−5),
 valid for k^2∈(5/6,12/5). Differentiating w.r.t. t=k^2 shows BD^2 decreases as t increases. Hence its infimum as t→12/5⁻ is
 480((12/5)+1)/(6·(12/5)−5)=480·(17/5)/(47/5)=8160/47.
 Thus for every rhombus BD^2&gt;8160/47, and 8160/47 is the greatest real number less than all such BD^2.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5aoz (yourself):
8160/47

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent jEF4:
The mistake is in the domain for k^2. You computed x1^2 = 240/(12−5k^2) leading to k^2&lt;12/5, but the correct intersection with y=kx gives x1^2 = 120/(6−5k^2), so k^2 must satisfy k^2&lt;6/5. Combined with k^2&gt;5/6 from the other diagonal, the domain is k^2∈(5/6,6/5). On that interval BD^2 = 480(k^2+1)/(6k^2−5) is strictly decreasing, so its infimum as k^2→6/5 is 480, not 8160/47.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We parametrize the rhombus by the slope k of diagonal AC (through the origin). Intersection of line y=kx with the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1 yields x^2 = 120/(6 - 5k^2), so k^2 &lt; 6/5. The perpendicular diagonal y = -x/k meets the hyperbola giving BD^2 = 480(k^2+1)/(6k^2 - 5), requiring k^2 &gt; 5/6. Thus k^2 ∈ (5/6, 6/5). On this interval BD^2 is strictly decreasing in k^2, so its greatest lower bound occurs as k^2 → 6/5, yielding BD^2 → 480. Hence the greatest real number less than all BD^2 is 480.
