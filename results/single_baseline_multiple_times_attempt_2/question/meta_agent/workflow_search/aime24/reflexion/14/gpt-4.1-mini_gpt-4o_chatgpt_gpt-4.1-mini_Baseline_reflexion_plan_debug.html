    <pre>The given hyperbola is centered at the origin with the equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let the diagonals be along the axes, with one diagonal along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. The vertices of the rhombus will be at points \((a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, b), (0, -b)\). These points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. For the points \((a, 0)\) and \((-a, 0)\), we have \(\frac{a^2}{20} = 1\), giving \(a^2 = 20\). For the points \((0, b)\) and \((0, -b)\), we have \(-\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\), which is not possible since \(b^2\) must be positive. Therefore, the diagonals cannot be aligned with the axes. Instead, consider the diagonals as \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) such that \(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2\) and \(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0\). The points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) must satisfy the hyperbola equation. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\). We want to maximize \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\) under the constraint \(\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1\). Let \(x_2^2 = 20\cosh^2(t)\) and \(y_2^2 = 24\sinh^2(t)\). Then \(x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 20\cosh^2(t) + 24\sinh^2(t)\). Using the identity \(\cosh^2(t) - \sinh^2(t) = 1\), we have \(x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 20 + 4\sinh^2(t)\). To maximize this, we need to maximize \(\sinh^2(t)\). As \(t\) increases, \(\sinh^2(t)\) increases without bound, but we are constrained by the hyperbola equation. The maximum occurs when \(\sinh^2(t)\) is as large as possible while still satisfying the hyperbola equation. Solving for \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\) gives \(x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 44\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is \(4 \times 44 = 176\). The greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) is 175.
