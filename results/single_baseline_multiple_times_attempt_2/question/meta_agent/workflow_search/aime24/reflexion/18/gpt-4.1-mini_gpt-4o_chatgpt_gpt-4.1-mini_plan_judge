Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The segment \(\overline{PQ}\) has endpoints P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and it has a unit length. We parameterize the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) and find the coordinates of C. Then, we calculate \(OC^2\) and express it as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where p and q are coprime integers. Finally, we find the sum \(p+q\).
