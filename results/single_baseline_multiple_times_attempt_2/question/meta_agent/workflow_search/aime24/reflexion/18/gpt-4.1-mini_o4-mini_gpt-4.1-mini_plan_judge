Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We have points O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), B=(0,√3/2). The family F consists of all unit‐length segments PQ with P=(p,0), Q=(0,q), p^2+q^2=1.  A point X=(x,y) on the segment AB can be parametrized by t∈(0,1) as X=((1−t)/2, (√3/2)t).  Such an X lies on a segment PQ in F if and only if there exists u∈(0,1) with X=(1−u)P+uQ, i.e.
   x=(1−u)p,  y=u q  with  p^2+q^2=1.
This leads to the equation
   (x/(1−u))^2 + (y/u)^2 = 1,
or after clearing denominators a quartic F(u)=0.  By construction F(t)=0 (the segment AB itself).  We seek the unique t for which this root t is double and no other root lies in (0,1), i.e.
   F(t)=0,  F′(t)=0.
Computing F(u)=4u^2(1−u)^2 − (1−t)^2u^2 − 3t^2(1−u)^2 and differentiating gives F′(t)=0 ⇒ t=3/4.  Hence C corresponds to t=3/4, with coordinates
   C=(x,y)=((1−3/4)/2, (√3/2)(3/4))=(1/8, 3√3/8).
Then OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 =1/64 +27/64 =28/64 =7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
