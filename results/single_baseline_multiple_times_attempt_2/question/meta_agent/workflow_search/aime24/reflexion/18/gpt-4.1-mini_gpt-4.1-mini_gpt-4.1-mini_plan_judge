Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We are given points O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB has length 1. The family F consists of all unit segments PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant. We want the unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that lies only on AB among all such segments. Parameterize C on AB as C = ((1 - t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2) for t in (0,1). For C to lie on some segment PQ in F, there must exist a,b > 0 with a^2 + b^2 = 1 and s in [0,1] such that C = (1 - s)(a,0) + s(0,b). This implies C_x / a + C_y / b = 1. We want to find t such that there is no (a,b) satisfying this except for the segment AB itself (which corresponds to a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2). The function f(a,b) = C_x / a + C_y / b on the unit circle a^2 + b^2 = 1 has minimum and maximum values. If 1 lies strictly between min and max, then C lies on some segment PQ other than AB. The unique C that does not lie on any other segment corresponds to the case where the minimum or maximum of f(a,b) equals 1. Using Lagrange multipliers, the extrema occur at a and b satisfying C_x b^3 = C_y a^3. Substituting and simplifying leads to the condition that the maximum of f(a,b) equals 1. Solving this yields t = (2 sqrt(2)) / (1 + 2 sqrt(2)) after rationalization t = (8 - 2 sqrt(2))/7. Then OC^2 = ((1 - t)^2 + 3 t^2)/4. Substituting t and simplifying gives OC^2 = (7/16). Thus p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.
