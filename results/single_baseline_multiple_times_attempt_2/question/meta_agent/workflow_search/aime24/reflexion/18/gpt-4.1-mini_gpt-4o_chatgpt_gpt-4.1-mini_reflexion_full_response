Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qWud', content='To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). The segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) has endpoints P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and it has a unit length. We parameterize the line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and find the coordinates of C. Then, we calculate \\(OC^2\\) and express it as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) where p and q are coprime integers. Finally, we find the sum \\(p+q\\).\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
