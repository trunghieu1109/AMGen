    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We want the probability that a random red/blue coloring (equivalently a subset B⊆Z8 of blue vertices) admits a non‐trivial rotation k for which B∩(B+k)=∅. Equivalently, a “good” B has at least one shift k∈{1,…,7} with no pairs in B at cyclic distance k. We count “bad” B whose cyclic autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts are ≥1, i.e. whose pair‐distance multiset covers all distances 1,2,3,4. For |B|&lt;4 there are ≤3 distances possible so they miss some distance ⇒ good. For |B|=4 we count 4‐subsets whose distance set covers {1,2,3,4}. By inclusion–exclusion we find exactly 48 such 4‐subsets are bad. For |B|=5,6,7,8 one checks any missing 3,2,1,0 points still leaves all four distances present, so all C(8,s) subsets of those sizes are bad. Hence bad count =48+56+28+8+1=141 and good count =256−141=115. Probability =115/256, m+n=115+256=371.
