Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the regular octagon and how the coloring can be invariant under these symmetries. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees). For the octagon to be rotatable such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, or the configuration must be symmetric in a way that allows such a rotation. 

First, consider the case where the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices. This means there are 4 blue and 4 red vertices. The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 8 for the blue vertices is \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \). 

Next, we need to determine how many of these configurations are invariant under some rotation. We use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct configurations is the average number of configurations fixed by each symmetry. 

- For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all 70 configurations are fixed.
- For a 45-degree rotation, no configuration is fixed because it would require all vertices to be the same color.
- For a 90-degree rotation, a configuration is fixed if it is the same after rotating by 90 degrees, which means it must be of the form (AABBCCDD). There are 2 such configurations (one with A, C, E, G blue and one with B, D, F, H blue).
- For a 135-degree rotation, no configuration is fixed because it would require all vertices to be the same color.
- For a 180-degree rotation, a configuration is fixed if it is the same after rotating by 180 degrees, which means it must be of the form (AABBCCDD). There are 6 such configurations (choose 2 positions for A, 2 for B, etc.).
- For a 225-degree rotation, no configuration is fixed because it would require all vertices to be the same color.
- For a 270-degree rotation, a configuration is fixed if it is the same after rotating by 270 degrees, which means it must be of the form (AABBCCDD). There are 2 such configurations.
- For a 315-degree rotation, no configuration is fixed because it would require all vertices to be the same color.

Using Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct configurations is \( \frac{1}{8} (70 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 2 + 0) = \frac{80}{8} = 10 \).

The total number of ways to color the octagon is \( 2^8 = 256 \). Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{10}{256} = \frac{5}{128} \).

Thus, \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 128 \), so \( m+n = 133 \).
