Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a tetrahedron with equal face distances from a point inside it, which suggests it is an orthocentric tetrahedron. The given edge lengths are symmetric, indicating that the tetrahedron is isosceles. We can use the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron with equal face distances, which is given by \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( S \) is the total surface area. First, we calculate the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. Then, we find the total surface area by calculating the area of each face using Heron's formula. Finally, we compute the inradius and express it in the required form to find \( m+n+p \).
