Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: reflexion

The approach of using the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume and Heron's formula for the surface area is correct. However, the final calculation of the inradius and the expression in the required form should be verified to ensure the correct values of m, n, and p are obtained.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
