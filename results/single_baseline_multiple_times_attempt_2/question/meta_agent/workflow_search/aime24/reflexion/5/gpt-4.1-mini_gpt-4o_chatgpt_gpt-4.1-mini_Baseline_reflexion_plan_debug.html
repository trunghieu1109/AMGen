    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SfAD (yourself):
The problem involves a tetrahedron with equal face distances from a point inside it, which suggests it is an orthocentric tetrahedron. The given edge lengths are symmetric, indicating that the tetrahedron is isosceles. We can use the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron with equal face distances, which is given by \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( S \) is the total surface area. First, we calculate the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. Then, we find the total surface area by calculating the area of each face using Heron&#39;s formula. Finally, we compute the inradius and express it in the required form to find \( m+n+p \).

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent wOFI:
The solution involves calculating the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The approach of using the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume and Heron&#39;s formula for the surface area is correct. However, the final calculation of the inradius and the expression in the required form should be verified to ensure the correct values of m, n, and p are obtained.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
