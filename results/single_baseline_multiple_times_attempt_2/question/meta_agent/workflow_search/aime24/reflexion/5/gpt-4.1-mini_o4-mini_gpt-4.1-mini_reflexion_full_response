Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IqWT', content='We recognize that the point I with equal distances to the faces is the insphere center, so the required distance is the inradius r = 3·Volume / Surface Area.  By labeling u=AB, v=AC, w=AD and opposite edges U=CD, V=BD, W=BC, all squared values match in pairs (41, 80, 89).  We compute the volume via the general edge‐length formula (or Cayley–Menger) to get Volume = 160/3.  Each face is a triangle with side‐squares 41,80,89, whose area by the formula Area = 1/4√[2(ab+bc+ca)−(a²+b²+c²)] yields 6√21.  Since there are four congruent faces, the surface area is 24√21.  Hence r = (3·160/3)/(24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63.  Thus m=20, n=21, p=63, giving m+n+p=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
