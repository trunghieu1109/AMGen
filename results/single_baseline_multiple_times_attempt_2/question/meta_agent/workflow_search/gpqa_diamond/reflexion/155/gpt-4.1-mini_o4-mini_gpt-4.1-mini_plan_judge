Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Epoxidation of E-alkene gives the trans-epoxide (racemic) which on acid opening (anti addition) yields the meso diol only. Epoxidation of Z-alkene gives the cis epoxide (meso) which opens anti to give a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols (R,R and S,S). So the combined mixture has three stereoisomers: one meso and two enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) column enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso + racemate). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three peaks.
