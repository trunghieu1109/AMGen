    <pre>The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will give one pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture) because the epoxidation is stereospecific and forms a trans-epoxide. The (Z)-alkene will give another pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture) because it forms a cis-epoxide. Thus, the product mixture contains two different racemic epoxides. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers co-elute, so each racemic mixture appears as one peak. Since there are two different racemic epoxides, there will be 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so each racemic mixture gives 2 peaks. Since there are two racemic mixtures, there will be 4 peaks in total. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
