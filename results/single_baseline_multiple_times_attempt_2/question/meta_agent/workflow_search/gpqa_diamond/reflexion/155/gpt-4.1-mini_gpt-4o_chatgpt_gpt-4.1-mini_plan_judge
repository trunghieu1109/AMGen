Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reactions involve the epoxidation of alkenes followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both reactions use mCPBA to form epoxides, which are then opened with aqueous acid. The stereochemistry of the starting alkenes will affect the stereochemistry of the products. The (E)-alkene will form a trans-epoxide, and the (Z)-alkene will form a cis-epoxide. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, the trans-epoxide will give a trans-diol, and the cis-epoxide will give a cis-diol. The trans-diol is a meso compound (achiral), while the cis-diol is a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the product mixture will contain one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. On a standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound and the pair of enantiomers will give 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, the meso compound will give 1 peak, and the pair of enantiomers will give 2 separate peaks, resulting in 3 peaks total.
