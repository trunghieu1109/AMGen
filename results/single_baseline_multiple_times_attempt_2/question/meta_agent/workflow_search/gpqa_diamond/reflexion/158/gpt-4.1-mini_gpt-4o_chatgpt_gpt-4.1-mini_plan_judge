Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The peak at 790 nm suggests a redshifted emission line, likely from hydrogen (H-alpha) which is originally at 656.3 nm. The redshift z can be calculated as z = (790 - 656.3) / 656.3. Using the Lambda-CDM model parameters, we can estimate the comoving distance. The redshift z is approximately 0.204. For a flat universe with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, and Omega_lambda = 0.7, the comoving distance D_C can be estimated using cosmological calculators or integrals. For z = 0.204, the comoving distance is approximately 0.8 Gpc, not 8 Gpc.
