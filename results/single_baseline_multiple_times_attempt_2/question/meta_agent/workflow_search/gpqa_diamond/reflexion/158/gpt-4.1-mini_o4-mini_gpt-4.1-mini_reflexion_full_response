Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Vr9h', content="The observed sharp drop at 790 nm is due to Lyα absorption (rest 121.6 nm), so 1+z=790/121.6⇒z≈5.5. In ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance is D_C=(c/H0)∫0^z dz'/√(Ωm(1+z')^3+ΩΛ). Numerically ∫0^5.5 dz/E(z)≈1.87, so D_C≈(300000/70)×1.87 Mpc≈4286×1.87≈8020 Mpc≈8 Gpc.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
