Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The observed sharp drop at 790 nm is due to Lyα absorption (rest 121.6 nm), so 1+z=790/121.6⇒z≈5.5. In ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance is D_C=(c/H0)∫0^z dz'/√(Ωm(1+z')^3+ΩΛ). Numerically ∫0^5.5 dz/E(z)≈1.87, so D_C≈(300000/70)×1.87 Mpc≈4286×1.87≈8020 Mpc≈8 Gpc.
