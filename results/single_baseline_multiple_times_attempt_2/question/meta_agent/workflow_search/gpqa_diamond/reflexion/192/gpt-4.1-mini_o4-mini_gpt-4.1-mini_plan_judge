Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let p=plx=1/r. Given dN/dp ∝1/p^5. To get dN/dr, use dN/dr=(dN/dp)(dp/dr). Since dp/dr = -1/r^2, we have |dN/dr| ∝(1/p^5)(1/r^2). But 1/p^5 = r^5, so dN/dr ∝ r^5/r^2 = r^3.
