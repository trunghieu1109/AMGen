Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OqPs', content='Let p=plx=1/r. Given dN/dp ∝1/p^5. To get dN/dr, use dN/dr=(dN/dp)(dp/dr). Since dp/dr = -1/r^2, we have |dN/dr| ∝(1/p^5)(1/r^2). But 1/p^5 = r^5, so dN/dr ∝ r^5/r^2 = r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
