Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, leading to the number of stars varying as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.
