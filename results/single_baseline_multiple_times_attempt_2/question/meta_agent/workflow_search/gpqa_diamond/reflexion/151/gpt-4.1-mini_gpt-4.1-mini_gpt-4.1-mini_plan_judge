Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question involves identifying which protein complex would be least observed in an assay targeting the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of yeast treated with a quorum-sensing peptide. Active chromatin is typically associated with transcriptionally active regions. The pre-initiation complex is involved in the initiation of transcription, so it would be present. Enhancer protein complexes are also involved in transcription regulation and would be present. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin structure and would be present. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication initiation, which is not directly related to active transcription and is generally assembled during the G1 phase before DNA synthesis. Since the assay targets active chromatin related to transcription, the pre-replication complex would be least observed.
