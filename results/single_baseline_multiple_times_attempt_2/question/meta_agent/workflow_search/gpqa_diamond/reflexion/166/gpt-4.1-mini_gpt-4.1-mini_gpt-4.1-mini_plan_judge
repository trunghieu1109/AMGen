proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 has a normalization constant N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Calculating sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1 and exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, so N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ 0.6275. This state is a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases, which is non-Gaussian. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) quantifies the difference between the state and its closest Gaussian reference state. For these parameters, the non-Gaussianity is known to be significant but not extremely high. Among the given options, 0 is incorrect since the state is non-Gaussian, 2.48 is too large for such a small alpha, and 0.25 seems too low. The value 1.38 is consistent with typical values reported for such cat states with these parameters. Therefore, the best choice is 1.38.
