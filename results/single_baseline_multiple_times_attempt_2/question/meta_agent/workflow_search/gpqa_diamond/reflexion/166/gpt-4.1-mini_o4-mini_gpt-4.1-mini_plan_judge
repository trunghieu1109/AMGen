Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: For φ=−π/4 the cat state has zero displacement and its reference Gaussian is the thermal state with mean photon number n̄ determined by the quadrature variances Var(x)=Var(p)=1/2+α²/(1−e^{-2α²}). At α=0.5 this yields n̄≈0.065, giving S(τ)= (n̄+1)ln(n̄+1)−n̄ ln n̄ ≈0.25. Since the cat state is pure (S(ρ)=0), δ_B= S(τ)≈0.25.
