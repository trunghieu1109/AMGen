proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, we need to evaluate the expression del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the Schrödinger cat state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2)*exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). The density matrix rho = |psi><psi|. The reference Gaussian state tau is typically chosen to have the same first and second moments as rho. However, for small alpha, the state is close to a Gaussian state, and the non-Gaussianity is expected to be small. Calculating the exact traces involves complex integrals, but for small alpha, the non-Gaussianity is often approximated to be very small or zero. Given the choices, the most reasonable answer is 0.
