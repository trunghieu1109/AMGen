Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Incompatible data formats usually cause immediate errors, but subtle mismatches like "chr" prefix differences, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions can silently shift or mislabel variant calls, leading to hard-to-spot errors. These three issues (choices 2, 3, and 4) are most problematic.
