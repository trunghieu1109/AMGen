Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question asks about the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The options given are: mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. All these issues are known to cause errors in genomics data analysis. Mutually incompatible data formats can cause errors but are often caught early. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion (whether chromosome names include the 'chr' prefix or not) is a very common source of subtle errors. Reference assembly mismatch (using different genome builds) is also a frequent and problematic issue. Incorrect ID conversion (e.g., gene IDs) can also cause errors. Therefore, all of the above are common sources of difficult-to-spot errors. Hence, the correct answer is 'All of the above'.
