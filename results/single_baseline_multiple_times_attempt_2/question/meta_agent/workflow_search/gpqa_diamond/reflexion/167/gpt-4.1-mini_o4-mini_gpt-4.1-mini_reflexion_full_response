Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ToUr', content='Incompatible data formats usually cause immediate errors, but subtle mismatches like "chr" prefix differences, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions can silently shift or mislabel variant calls, leading to hard-to-spot errors. These three issues (choices 2, 3, and 4) are most problematic.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
