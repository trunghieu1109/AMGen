Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operators P and Q. The matrix P is given by: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. The matrix Q is given by: Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. First, we find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, we find that λ = 0 is an eigenvalue of P. The corresponding eigenvector can be found by solving (P - 0I)v = 0. After solving, we find that the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0 is (1, 0, -1). Next, we find the eigenvectors of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. Solving the characteristic equation det(Q - λI) = 0, we find that λ = -1 is an eigenvalue of Q. The corresponding eigenvector can be found by solving (Q + I)v = 0, which gives us the eigenvector v = (0, 0, 1). The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). We need to project this state onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, which is (1, 0, -1). The projection is given by the inner product of the state with the eigenvector, which is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = -2. The probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of this projection, which is |-2|^2 = 4. After measuring 0 for P, the state collapses to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1). We then measure Q. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of the inner product of the new state (1, 0, -1) with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to -1, which is (0, 0, 1). The inner product is (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (-1)(1) = -1, so the probability is |-1|^2 = 1. Therefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.
