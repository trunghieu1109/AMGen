    <pre>First, we identify the eigenstates and eigenvalues of operator P. The matrix for P is:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]
We want the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue 0 for P.

Next, the operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. The eigenstate for Q = -1 corresponds to the vector (0, 0, 1).

The initial state is |psi&gt; = (-1, 2, 1).

Step 1: Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Solve P|v&gt; = 0|v&gt;.
Let |v&gt; = (x, y, z).
Then:
0 = P|v&gt; = [ (1/sqrt(2)) y, (1/sqrt(2)) x + (1/sqrt(2)) z, (1/sqrt(2)) y ]
From first component: (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 =&gt; y = 0
From third component: (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 =&gt; y = 0 (consistent)
From second component: (1/sqrt(2)) x + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 =&gt; x + z = 0 =&gt; z = -x

So eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v&gt; = (x, 0, -x) = x(1, 0, -1).
Normalize: norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Step 2: Probability of measuring 0 for P in state |psi&gt; is |&lt;v|psi&gt;|^2.
Calculate &lt;v|psi&gt; = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2)) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).
Probability = |&lt;v|psi&gt;|^2 / (norm of |psi|)^2.
Norm of |psi|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
So probability P=0 = (sqrt(2))^2 / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3.

Step 3: After measuring P=0, the state collapses to |v&gt; = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Step 4: Now measure Q. The eigenstate for Q = -1 is (0, 0, 1).
Probability of measuring Q = -1 in state |v&gt; is |&lt;q|v&gt;|^2 = |(0, 0, 1) . (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))|^2 = |-1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.

Step 5: The total probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6, which corresponds to choice B).
