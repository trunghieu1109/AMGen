Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Treating it with sodium hydride and benzyl bromide will deprotonate the hydroxyl group and form a benzyl ether, resulting in 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (product 1). Next, treating with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and HCl will form a tosylhydrazone, replacing the ketone with a tosylhydrazone group (product 2). Treating this with n-butyllithium will perform a Shapiro reaction, eliminating the tosylhydrazone and forming an alkene, resulting in 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexene (product 3). Finally, hydrogenation with Pd/C will reduce the alkene to an alkane, and also reduce the benzyl ether to a primary alcohol, giving (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol (product 4).
