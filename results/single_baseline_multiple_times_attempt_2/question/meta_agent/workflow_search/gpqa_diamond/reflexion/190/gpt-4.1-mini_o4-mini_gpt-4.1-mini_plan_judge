Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Step 1: NaH then benzyl bromide converts the OHCH2 group at C-3 into a benzyloxymethyl ether. Step 2: Tosylhydrazide with HCl forms the tosylhydrazone at the ketone. Step 3: n-BuLi/Shapiro reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone to give an endocyclic alkene at C1â€“C2, while preserving the benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl groups. Step 4: H2/PdC hydrogenates both the ring alkene and the isopropenyl double bond to yield a saturated cyclohexane ring bearing a benzyloxymethyl substituent and an isopropyl substituent. The only choice matching 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexane is choice C).
