Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wmGl', content="Given that the stars have the same peak wavelength, by Wien's law, they have the same temperature. Luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the ratio of luminosities depends on the square of the ratio of their radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
