Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In the original decay, the continuous energy spectrum of the E particles is due to the neutrinos (V) sharing energy with the E particles. In the variant decay, the massless particle M can still take a range of energies, allowing the E particles to have a continuous energy distribution. The endpoint energy for the E particles will increase because the single massless particle M takes less energy than the two neutrinos combined, leaving more energy available for the E particles.
