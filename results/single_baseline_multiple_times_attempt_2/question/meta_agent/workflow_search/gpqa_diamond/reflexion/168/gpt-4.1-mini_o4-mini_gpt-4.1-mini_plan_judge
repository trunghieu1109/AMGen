Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In the original 2νββ decay (2A→2B+2e+2ν), the two neutrinos carry away a variable share of energy, giving a continuous electron sum-energy spectrum ending at Q (when both neutrinos take zero kinetic energy). Replacing the two neutrinos with a single massless exotic particle still produces a three-body final state (2e+M), so the electron spectrum remains continuous. Moreover, since the exotic has zero mass, it can carry zero energy at its minimum, so the electrons can recover the full Q–energy that was previously shared by two neutrinos with non-zero masses. Hence the electron endpoint increases compared to the original 2νββ case.
