    <pre>In the original decay 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among multiple particles (2E and 2V), allowing a range of energy distributions. The endpoint Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy.

In the variant decay, one exotic, massless particle M replaces the 2V particles. Since M is massless and only one particle replaces two, the energy and momentum conservation constraints change. However, there are still multiple particles in the final state (2E and 1M), so the energy spectrum of E remains continuous, but the shape of the spectrum changes due to the different kinematics.

Regarding the endpoint, since M is massless and only one particle replaces two heavier particles, the total available energy for the E particles can increase, leading to an increased endpoint energy.

Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
