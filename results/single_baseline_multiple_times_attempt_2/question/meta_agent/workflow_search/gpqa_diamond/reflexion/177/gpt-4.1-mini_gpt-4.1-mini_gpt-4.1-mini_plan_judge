proposed answer: First, determine the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). The Lagrangian density in 4D spacetime has mass dimension 4. The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2. The gamma matrices and \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) are dimensionless. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. So, the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 7. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, \( \kappa \) must have dimension 4 - 7 = -3. However, this contradicts the options given, so let's re-express carefully: \( \bar{\psi} \) has dimension 3/2, \( \psi \) has dimension 3/2, so \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has dimension 3. \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension 2. So total dimension without \( \kappa \) is 3 + 2 = 5. To get total dimension 4, \( \kappa \) must have dimension -1. Therefore, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \). Since \( \kappa \) has negative mass dimension, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice is the one stating \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable.
