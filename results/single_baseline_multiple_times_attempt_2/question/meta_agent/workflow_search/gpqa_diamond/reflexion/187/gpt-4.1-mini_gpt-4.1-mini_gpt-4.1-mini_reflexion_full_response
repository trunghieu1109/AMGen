The formula for the interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral lattice is:\n\nd_hkl = a * sqrt(1 - 3*cos^2(α) + 2*cos^3(α)) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(α))\n\nFirst, calculate cos(α) = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nCalculate numerator term: sqrt(1 - 3*cos^2(α) + 2*cos^3(α))\ncos^2(α) = (0.866)^2 = 0.75\ncos^3(α) = (0.866)^3 ≈ 0.6495\nSo numerator term = sqrt(1 - 3*0.75 + 2*0.6495) = sqrt(1 - 2.25 + 1.299) = sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.221\n\nCalculate denominator term: sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(α))\nFor (111), h=k=l=1\nh^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 3\nhk + kl + lh = 3\nSo denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*3*0.866) = sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863\n\nTherefore, d_111 = a * numerator / denominator = 10 * 0.221 / 2.863 ≈ 0.772 Å\n\nThis value is much smaller than the given options, so let's check the formula. Another formula for interplanar spacing in rhombohedral lattice is:\n\n1/d_hkl^2 = (1 - cos^2(α)) / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(α))) * (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(α))\n\nCalculate 1/d^2:\n(1 - cos^2(α)) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n(1 + 2*cos(α)) = 1 + 2*0.866 = 2.732\nSo numerator = 0.25\nDenominator = a^2 * 2.732 = 100 * 2.732 = 273.2\n\n(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(α)) = 3 + 2*3*0.866 = 8.196\n\nSo 1/d^2 = (0.25 / 273.2) * 8.196 = (0.000915) * 8.196 = 0.0075\n\nTherefore, d = 1 / sqrt(0.0075) = 1 / 0.0866 = 11.54 Å\n\nThis is larger than the interatomic distance, which is possible. But none of the options match 11.54 Å.\n\nAlternatively, the interplanar spacing for rhombohedral lattice can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd_hkl = a * sqrt(1 - 3*cos^2(α) + 2*cos^3(α)) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(α))\n\nUsing the previous calculation, numerator = 0.221, denominator = 2.863, so d = 10 * 0.221 / 2.863 = 0.772 Å, which is too small.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, the best match from the options is 9.08 Å, which is closest to the interatomic distance and reasonable for the (111) plane spacing.\n\nHence, the answer is C).\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent VWWJ (yourself):\nC)\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent RnTY:\nThe initial calculation using the formula d_hkl = a * sqrt(1 - 3*cos^2(α) + 2*cos^3(α)) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(α)) resulted in a very small value (0.772 Å), which is inconsistent with the expected interplanar spacing. The second approach using 1/d^2 formula gave d ≈ 11.54 Å, which is larger than the lattice parameter a = 10 Å, but physically possible. The discrepancy suggests a possible misapplication or misunderstanding of the formula or parameters. The final choice of 9.08 Å (choice C) is a reasonable approximation close to the lattice parameter, but the calculations do not directly support it. Therefore, the reasoning is flawed, and the answer is not definitively correct.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
