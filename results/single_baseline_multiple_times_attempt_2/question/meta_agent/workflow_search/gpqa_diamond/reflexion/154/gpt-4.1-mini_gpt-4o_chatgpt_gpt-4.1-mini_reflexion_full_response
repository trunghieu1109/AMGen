The state \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is given, and the matrix for \\( P_z \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\). Calculate \\( \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle \\) and \\( \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle \\). Then, \\( \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} \\). The correct choice is \\( \\hbar \\).\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
