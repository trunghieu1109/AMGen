Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, compute apparent magnitudes for each star.  
Canopus: V≈–0.72. Polaris: V≈1.98.  
For the M=15 stars at distances:  
– at 10 pc: m=15+5·log10(10/10)=15  
– at 200 pc: m=15+5·log10(200)−5≈21.5  
– at 5 pc: m=15+5·log10(5)−5≈13.5  
– at 50 pc: m=15+5·log10(50)−5≈18.5  
ESPRESSO on one 8 m UT achieves S/N≈10 per pixel in 1 h for stars up to V≈16.  
Detectable (m≤16): Canopus, Polaris, the 10 pc (m=15) star, and the 5 pc (m≈13.5) star.  
Undetectable (m>16): the 200 pc (m≈21.5) and the 50 pc (m≈18.5) stars.  
That’s 4 detectable stars.
