Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, we need to determine the apparent magnitude of each star to assess if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope. The detection limit for ESPRESSO is roughly around V=16 mag for S/N=10 in 1 hour. 

Given stars:
- a) Canopus: Very bright star, apparent magnitude ~ -0.7, easily detectable.
- b) Polaris: Bright star, apparent magnitude ~ 2.0, easily detectable.
- c) Star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 10 pc: Apparent magnitude = absolute magnitude + 5*log10(distance/10) = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15 mag, detectable.
- d) Star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 200 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) = 15 + 5*1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505 mag, too faint to detect.
- e) Star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 5 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*(-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495 mag, detectable.
- f) Star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 50 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495 mag, too faint to detect.

Detectable stars: a, b, c, e = 4 stars.

Therefore, the answer is 4.
