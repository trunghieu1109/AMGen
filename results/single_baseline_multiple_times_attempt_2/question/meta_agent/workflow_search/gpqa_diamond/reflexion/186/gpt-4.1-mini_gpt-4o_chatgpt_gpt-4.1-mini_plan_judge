proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and check if it is bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, which has a certain sensitivity limit. 

1. Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74, so it is easily detectable.
2. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98, which is also detectable.
3. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 10 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15 mag (since distance modulus is 0 at 10 pc). This is likely detectable.
4. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 200 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*2 = 25 mag, which is too faint to be detectable.
5. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 5 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 - 1.5 = 13.5 mag, which is detectable.
6. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 50 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 3.5 = 18.5 mag, which is likely detectable.

Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 50 pc, making a total of 5 detectable stars.
