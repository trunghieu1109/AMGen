Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all Co species. Using cumulative constants β1–β4 and approximating [SCN-]free≈0.1 M (since [Co]≪[SCN]), the distribution factor D=1+β1[SCN]+β2[SCN]^2+β3[SCN]^3+β4[SCN]^4=1+9·0.1+40·0.01+63·0.001+16·0.0001≈2.3646. The fraction α2=β2[SCN]^2/D=40·0.01/2.3646≈0.169, i.e. 16.9%.
