proposed answer: Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes, we want to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt species. The complexes are formed as follows: Co + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN), Co(SCN) + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2, etc. The overall formation constants are given, so the concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of free Co(II) and SCN- concentrations. Assuming free SCN- concentration is approximately 0.1 M (since it is in excess), and total Co is 10^-2 M, we can write: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co][SCN-] = 9 * [Co] * 0.1 = 0.9 * [Co], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * (0.1)^2 = 40 * [Co] * 0.01 = 0.4 * [Co], [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co] * (0.1)^3 = 63 * [Co] * 0.001 = 0.063 * [Co], [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co] * (0.1)^4 = 16 * [Co] * 0.0001 = 0.0016 * [Co]. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co]_total = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = [Co] * (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = [Co] * 2.3646. Therefore, [Co] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Then, [Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * [Co] = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%.
