Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and divide it by the total cobalt concentration. The formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria: Co + SCN- <-> Co(SCN), Co(SCN) + SCN- <-> Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)2 + SCN- <-> Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)3 + SCN- <-> Co(SCN)4. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. We calculate each concentration using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co and SCN-. Then, we find the percentage of Co(SCN)2 by dividing its concentration by the total cobalt concentration and multiplying by 100%.
