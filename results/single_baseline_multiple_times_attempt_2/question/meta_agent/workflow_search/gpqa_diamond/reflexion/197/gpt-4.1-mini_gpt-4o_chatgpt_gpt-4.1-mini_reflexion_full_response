Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FTju', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and divide it by the total cobalt concentration. The formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria: Co + SCN- <-> Co(SCN), Co(SCN) + SCN- <-> Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)2 + SCN- <-> Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)3 + SCN- <-> Co(SCN)4. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. We calculate each concentration using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co and SCN-. Then, we find the percentage of Co(SCN)2 by dividing its concentration by the total cobalt concentration and multiplying by 100%.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
