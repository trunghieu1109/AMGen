Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the relative masses of the two binary star systems, we can use Kepler's third law and the information about the radial velocity amplitudes. The period of the orbit and the radial velocity amplitudes can help us estimate the mass of each system. For a binary system, the mass function is given by f(m) = (P/2πG) * (K1 + K2)^3, where P is the period, G is the gravitational constant, and K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s. The mass function is proportional to (P * (K1 + K2)^3). Calculating for system_1: f(m1) ∝ 2 * (10 + 5)^3 = 2 * 3375 = 6750. For system_2: f(m2) ∝ 1 * (15 + 10)^3 = 1 * 3375 = 3375. The ratio of the mass functions is f(m1)/f(m2) = 6750/3375 = 2. Therefore, system_1 is approximately twice as massive as system_2. However, the choices given are not exact, so we look for the closest approximation, which is choice 1.2.
