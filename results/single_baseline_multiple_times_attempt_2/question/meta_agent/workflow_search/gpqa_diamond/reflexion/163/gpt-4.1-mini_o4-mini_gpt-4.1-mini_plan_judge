Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Compute semimajor axes from radial velocities and periods: a_total sin i = (K1+K2)P/(2π), convert to AU. System1: (10+5 km/s)*2 yr ⇒ a1 ≈1.01 AU; M1 ≈a1^3/P1^2≈1.01^3/4≈0.255 M☉. System2: (15+10 km/s)*1 yr ⇒ a2 ≈0.84 AU; M2≈0.84^3/1≈0.593 M☉. Ratio M1/M2≈0.255/0.593≈0.43≈0.4.
