Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The total mass of a binary system can be estimated using Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The period P and the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 give us information about the masses. The mass function for a binary system is related to the period and the velocity amplitudes. The total mass M_total is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s. Calculate the ratio M1 / M2 = ((K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1) / ((K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2). Sum of velocities for system_1 = 15 km/s, for system_2 = 25 km/s. So, ratio = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / (15625) = 6750 / 15625 â‰ˆ 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2, or system_1 is less massive by a factor of about 0.4.
