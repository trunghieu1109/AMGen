Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have psi = (-1,2,1). Observable P has eigenvalues ±1,0. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 satisfies v2=0, v3=-v1, so choose |phi>=(1,0,-1)/√2. Compute inner product <phi|psi> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1)= -2/√2= -√2. Squared modulus = 2. Norm of psi = √6, squared=6. Probability = 2/6 = 1/3.
