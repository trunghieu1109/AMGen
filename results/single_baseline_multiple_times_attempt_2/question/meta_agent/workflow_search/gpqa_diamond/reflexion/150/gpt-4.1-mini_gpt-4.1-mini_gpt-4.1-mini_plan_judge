proposed answer: First, normalize the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The observable P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We need to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. This means we need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project |ψ> onto that eigenspace and find the squared magnitude of that projection.

Find eigenvalues of P:
Let’s denote a = 1/sqrt(2).

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

P - λI = [[-λ, a, 0],
           [a, -λ, a],
           [0, a, -λ]]

Calculate determinant:
= -λ * det([[-λ, a], [a, -λ]]) - a * det([[a, a], [0, -λ]]) + 0
= -λ * (λ^2 - a^2) - a * (a*(-λ) - 0) + 0
= -λ (λ^2 - a^2) - a * (-aλ)
= -λ^3 + λ a^2 + a^2 λ
= -λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ

Set equal to zero:
-λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ = 0
λ(-λ^2 + 2 a^2) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ = 0 or λ^2 = 2 a^2
Since a = 1/sqrt(2), a^2 = 1/2
So λ^2 = 2 * (1/2) = 1
λ = ±1

Eigenvalues: -1, 0, 1

Now find eigenvector for λ=0:
(P - 0*I) v = 0
P v = 0

P v = [a v2, a v1 + a v3, a v2] = 0

From first component: a v2 = 0 => v2 = 0
From third component: a v2 = 0 => v2 = 0 (consistent)
From second component: a v1 + a v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v3 = -v1

So eigenvector for λ=0 is v = (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1)

Normalize eigenvector:
Norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector |φ> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

Now project |ψ> onto |φ>:
<φ|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))
= (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + 0 - (1)/(sqrt(12)) = -2 / sqrt(12) = -2 / (2 * sqrt(3)) = -1 / sqrt(3)

Probability = |<φ|ψ>|^2 = (1 / sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3

Therefore, the probability that the measurement yields 0 is 1/3.
