    <pre>To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a crystal lattice, often related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can arise in certain field theories and is often associated with broken symmetries in magnetic systems. A pion is a meson that arises as a Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, which is not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. Therefore, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
