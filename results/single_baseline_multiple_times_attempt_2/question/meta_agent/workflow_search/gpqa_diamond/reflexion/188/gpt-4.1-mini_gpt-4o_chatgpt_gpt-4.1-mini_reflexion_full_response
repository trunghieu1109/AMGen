Question: {'question': 'Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', 'choice1': 'Magnon', 'choice2': 'Skyrmion', 'choice3': 'Pion', 'choice4': 'Phonon'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VvKM', content='To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a crystal lattice, often related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can arise in certain field theories and is often associated with broken symmetries in magnetic systems. A pion is a meson that arises as a Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, which is not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. Therefore, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
