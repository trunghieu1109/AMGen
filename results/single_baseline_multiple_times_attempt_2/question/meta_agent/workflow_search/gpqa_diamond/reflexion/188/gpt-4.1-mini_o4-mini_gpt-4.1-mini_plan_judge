Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We examine the four quasiparticles: Magnons are spin waves, Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken spin‚Äêrotational symmetry. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous translation symmetry in a crystal. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons (nonlinear field configurations) rather than Goldstone modes arising directly from a broken continuous symmetry. Thus the one not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
