    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$.

What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R.

    <pre>The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge is inside the cavity, the conductor will rearrange its charges to ensure the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. However, outside the conductor, the conductor behaves like a neutral object with no net charge. The charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the inner surface of the cavity and on the outer surface of the conductor, but the total charge on the conductor remains zero. From outside the conductor, the net effect is that the conductor shields the charge inside the cavity, and the electric field outside the conductor is zero. But the problem states the point P is outside the spherical conductor at distance L &gt; R. Since the conductor is neutral and the charge is inside the cavity, the external field due to the conductor plus cavity system is zero. However, if the conductor is grounded or isolated, the field outside is zero. But if the conductor is isolated and uncharged, the field outside is zero. Therefore, the field at point P outside the conductor is zero. But the problem gives options for the field as if the charge +q is outside or in free space. Since the conductor shields the field, the field outside is zero. But none of the options is zero. Alternatively, if the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is inside the cavity, the field outside the conductor is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, i.e., the conductor plus cavity system behaves like a point charge +q at the center. But this is not correct because the conductor is neutral. Actually, the conductor will induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and +q on the outer surface, so the net charge outside is +q, so the field outside is as if a charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the field at point P outside the conductor is E = (1/4πε₀) * q / L². So the correct choice is choice4.
