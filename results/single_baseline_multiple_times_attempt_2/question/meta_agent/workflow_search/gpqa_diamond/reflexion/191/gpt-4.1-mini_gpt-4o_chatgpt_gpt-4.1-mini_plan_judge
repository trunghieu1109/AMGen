Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity within a conductor. By electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and the conductor will have an induced charge on its inner surface to cancel the field from +q. The outer surface of the conductor will have a net charge of +q, as the conductor is initially uncharged. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the net charge on the conductor's surface, which is +q. By symmetry, the field at a point outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor at distance L from the center is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.
