proposed answer: The question involves electrophilic substitution on benzene derivatives and the relative amounts of para-isomer formed. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) generally direct substitution to ortho and para positions, increasing para-isomer yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) generally direct substitution to meta positions, reducing para-isomer yield. The substituents are: 1) CH3 (methyl, EDG), 2) COOC2H5 (ester, EWG), 3) Cl (halogen, weakly deactivating but ortho/para directing), 4) NO2 (strong EWG, meta directing), 5) C2H5 (ethyl, EDG), 6) COOH (carboxylic acid, EWG). The order of increasing para-isomer yield should start with strong EWGs (NO2), then other EWGs (COOH, COOC2H5), then halogen (Cl), then EDGs (CH3, C2H5). So the order is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This matches choice 4.
