Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer in monobromination of substituted benzenes. Para‐fraction correlates with ortho/para directing strength: strongest meta director (–NO2) gives almost no para, then other meta directors (–COOR, –COOH), then deactivating ortho/para (–Cl), then weak activating ortho/para (–CH3, –C2H5) giving highest para. Between –COOR and –COOH, nitration data show benzoic acid gives a higher para % than methyl benzoate, so –COOR (2) < –COOH (6). Thus sequence: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5, matching choice2.
