Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃: M ≈ 55.85 + 3·17.01 = 106.87 g/mol, so n = 0.100 g/106.87 g/mol = 9.36·10⁻⁴ mol. Dissolution requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃, so H⁺ needed = 3·9.36·10⁻⁴ = 2.81·10⁻³ mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume = 2.81·10⁻³/0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm³. That matches choice A. The given pH for that choice is 2.04.
