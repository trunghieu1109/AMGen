Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with the strong acid (monobasic, 0.1 M) to dissolve. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O, so 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. Total moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 mol = 0.002808 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so volume of acid needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, so the acid volume is about 28.08 cm3. The pH can be estimated from the leftover acid or from the concentration of H+ after reaction. Since all H+ is consumed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the pH will be determined by the excess acid or hydrolysis. Given the choices, the closest volume is 28.05 cm3 with pH 2.04. Therefore, the answer is choice A).
