Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zWWs', content='First calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃: M ≈ 55.85 + 3·17.01 = 106.87 g/mol, so n = 0.100 g/106.87 g/mol = 9.36·10⁻⁴ mol. Dissolution requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃, so H⁺ needed = 3·9.36·10⁻⁴ = 2.81·10⁻³ mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume = 2.81·10⁻³/0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm³. That matches choice A. The given pH for that choice is 2.04.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
