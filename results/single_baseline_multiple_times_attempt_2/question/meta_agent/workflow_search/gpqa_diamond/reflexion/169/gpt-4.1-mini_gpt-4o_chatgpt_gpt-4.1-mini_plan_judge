proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, we need to use the given spin state and the Pauli matrix for the y-direction, \sigma_y. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), which we can write as a column vector: |\psi> = (3i, 4)^T. The Pauli matrix \sigma_y is given as \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}. The expectation value of S_y is given by the formula: <\psi| \sigma_y |\psi>. First, we find \sigma_y |\psi>: \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i*3i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -9 \end{pmatrix}. Next, we find <\psi| \sigma_y |\psi>: (3i, 4)^* \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -9 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i, 4) \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -9 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-9) = 12 - 36 = -24. The expectation value of S_y is then (-24) * (\hbar/2) = -12\hbar. However, we need to normalize the state |\psi>. The norm of |\psi> is sqrt((3i)^*(3i) + 4^*4) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. The normalized state is (1/5)(3i, 4). The expectation value with the normalized state is (-12\hbar)/25.
