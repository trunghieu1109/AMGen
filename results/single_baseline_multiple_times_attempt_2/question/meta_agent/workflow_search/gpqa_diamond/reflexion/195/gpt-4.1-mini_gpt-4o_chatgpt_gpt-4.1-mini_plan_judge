Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is U = (1/2)kA^2. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy mc^2 and the kinetic energy T. At maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. The relativistic kinetic energy is T = (γ - 1)mc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. Equating the total energy at maximum amplitude and at maximum speed, we have mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γmc^2. Solving for v_max, we find v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2).
