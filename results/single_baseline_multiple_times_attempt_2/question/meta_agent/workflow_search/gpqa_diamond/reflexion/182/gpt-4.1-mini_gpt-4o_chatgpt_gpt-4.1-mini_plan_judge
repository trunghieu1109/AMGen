Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a carboxylic acid group. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a reducing condition that will saturate the compound. The double bonds in the cyclohexene and the vinyl group will be reduced, and the formyl and carboxylic acid groups will be reduced to alkyl groups. This will result in a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with no double bonds or rings, giving an index of hydrogen deficiency of 0.
