Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction of a carboxylic acid and aldehyde with red P/HI (Clemmensen‚Äêtype conditions) will decarboxylate the acid (removing the COOH as CO2) and reduce the aldehyde to a methyl group. The ring double bond and the vinyl substituent remain intact. The product is thus a cyclohexene (one ring = 1 DU) bearing one ring C=C (1 DU) and one vinyl C=C (1 DU), for a total of 3 degrees of unsaturation.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
