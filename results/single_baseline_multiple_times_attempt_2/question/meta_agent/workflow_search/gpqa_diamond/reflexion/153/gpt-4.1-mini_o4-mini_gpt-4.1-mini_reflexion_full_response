Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 at 158 (3:1 ratio) indicates one Cl atom. The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band, characteristic of a carboxylic acid (O–H stretch plus C=O). The ¹H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm (acid OH) and shows only two aromatic signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), an AA′BB′ pattern consistent with a para-substituted benzene. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this data.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
