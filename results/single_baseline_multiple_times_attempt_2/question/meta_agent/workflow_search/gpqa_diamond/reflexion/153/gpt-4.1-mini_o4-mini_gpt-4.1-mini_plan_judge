Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 at 158 (3:1 ratio) indicates one Cl atom. The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band, characteristic of a carboxylic acid (O–H stretch plus C=O). The ¹H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm (acid OH) and shows only two aromatic signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), an AA′BB′ pattern consistent with a para-substituted benzene. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this data.
