Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroidal, which suggests a dipole radiation pattern. The power radiated by a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta), where theta is the angle with respect to the axis of symmetry (z-axis). The maximum power is radiated at theta = 90 degrees, and the power at any other angle theta is given by P(theta) = A * sin^2(theta). At theta = 30 degrees, sin(30) = 1/2, so sin^2(30) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4. The power radiated by a dipole is also proportional to 1/lambda^4, which is a characteristic of dipole radiation. Therefore, the function f should be proportional to lambda^(-4).
