Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We enumerate the 8 spin configurations. When all three spins are equal (2 states), S1S2+S1S3+S2S3=3, giving contribution e^{β·3J}. The remaining 6 states have two spins aligned and one opposite, giving sum = –1 and contribution e^{–βJ}. Thus Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{–Jβ}, which matches choice A).
