Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor that functions as a dimer. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is recessive loss-of-function, meaning that one functional copy is enough for normal function. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is dominant-negative, meaning that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Since the protein functions as a dimer, the mutant subunit can dimerize with the wild-type subunit but disrupt the function of the dimer. This typically results in loss of function despite the presence of one wild-type allele. Therefore, the molecular phenotype is likely loss of protein dimerization and a dominant-negative effect, but the wild-type phenotype is not observed. Among the choices, 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype' is inconsistent because dominant-negative mutations usually do not produce a wild-type phenotype. 'Protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' fits well because dominant-negative mutations often cause misfolding or aggregation, leading to loss of function. 'Protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele' is possible but less typical for dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains. 'Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype' is inconsistent with dominant-negative loss-of-function. Therefore, the best choice is B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
