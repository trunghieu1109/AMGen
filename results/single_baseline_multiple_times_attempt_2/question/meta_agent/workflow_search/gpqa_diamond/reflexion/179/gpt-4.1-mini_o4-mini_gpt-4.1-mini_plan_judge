Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have one charge q0=2e at the center P and 12 identical charges q=2e constrained on a sphere of radius R=2 m. The minimum-energy configuration of 12 equal charges on a sphere is the icosahedral arrangement. Total electrostatic energy U = sum over all pairs kqiqj/rij.
Break into two parts: center–sphere interactions and sphere–sphere interactions.
Center–sphere: 12 pairs each at r=2 m gives U1=12·kq^2/2=6kq^2.
Sphere–sphere: For 12 charges on a sphere of radius R, the Thomson energy for N=12 (unit sphere) is E_unit=∑_{i<j}1/rij≈49.16. Scaling to R gives U2=kq^2E_unit/R=kq^2·49.16/2.
Thus U_total=kq^2[6+49.16/2]=kq^2·30.58. With k≈8.988×10^9 N·m^2/C^2 and q=2e=3.2×10^−19 C, q^2≈1.024×10^−37 C^2, so kq^2≈9.204×10^−28 J, giving U≈9.204×10^−28×30.58≈2.82×10^−26 J.  
Matches choice1 2.822×10^−26 J.
