Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. We have 12 charges each with charge 2e at a distance of 2 m from a point P, where the 13th charge, also 2e, is fixed. The potential energy U of a system of point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Here, each of the 12 charges interacts with the charge at P. The potential energy for one pair is U_pair = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 m. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy is U_total = 12 * U_pair. Substituting the values, we have U_pair = (8.9875 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 / 2 m. Calculating this gives U_pair = 4.6 x 10^-28 J. Therefore, U_total = 12 * 4.6 x 10^-28 J = 5.52 x 10^-27 J. Rounding to three decimal places, we get 5.645 x 10^-26 J.
