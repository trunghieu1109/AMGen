Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge q = 2e = 3.2 x 10^-19 C. One charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are constrained to be on a sphere of radius r = 2 m around P. The total electrostatic potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. There are two types of pairs: (1) between the center charge and each of the 12 charges on the sphere, and (2) between the 12 charges themselves on the sphere. The Coulomb constant k = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2. The energy between the center charge and each charge on the sphere is U_center = 12 * k * q^2 / r = 12 * 8.99 x 10^9 * (3.2 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. Calculating this gives approximately 5.52 x 10^-27 J. The energy among the 12 charges on the sphere depends on their arrangement. The minimum energy configuration is when the charges are as far apart as possible, which corresponds to the vertices of a regular polyhedron or a configuration minimizing repulsion. The mutual potential energy among the 12 charges is significant and adds to the total energy. The problem likely expects the total minimum energy including both contributions. The given choices are: A) 2.822 x 10^-26, B) 5.645 x 10^-26, C) 7.056 x 10^-27, D) 122.330. Since the energy between the center and the 12 charges is about 5.5 x 10^-27 J, and the mutual repulsion among the 12 charges is larger, the total energy should be on the order of 10^-26 J. Among the choices, B) 5.645 x 10^-26 J is the closest reasonable value for the total minimum energy. Therefore, the answer is B).
