    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, meaning it transits the star with a small offset from the center. The second planet must also transit, which means its impact parameter must be less than 1. Additionally, for the second planet to exhibit an occultation, it must pass behind the star, which means its orbit must be such that it can be completely obscured by the star. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is 1, and for an occultation, it is also 1. The second planet has a larger radius, which means it can have a slightly larger impact parameter and still transit. However, the key constraint is that the second planet must have an orbit that allows it to be completely obscured by the star. The star&#39;s radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun, and the second planet&#39;s radius is 2.5 times that of Earth. The first planet&#39;s orbital period is 3 days. Using Kepler&#39;s third law and the fact that the second planet must have a similar orbital plane, we can calculate the maximum orbital period. The maximum orbital period is determined by the condition that the second planet&#39;s orbit must allow for both transit and occultation, which means its semi-major axis must be such that the planet can be completely behind the star. This condition is met when the semi-major axis is such that the planet&#39;s orbit is tangent to the star&#39;s limb. Given the star&#39;s radius and the planet&#39;s radius, we can calculate the maximum semi-major axis and thus the maximum orbital period. The maximum orbital period is approximately 33.5 days.
