    <pre>The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and orbits a star with radius 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius. The impact parameter is 0.2, which means the transit chord is close to the center of the star&#39;s disk. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii and orbits in the same plane with a circular orbit. We want the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that it still exhibits both transit and occultation events. For a planet to show both transit and occultation, its impact parameter must be less than (R_star - R_planet)/a, where a is the semi-major axis. Since the planets share the same orbital plane, the impact parameter scales with a. The first planet&#39;s impact parameter is 0.2 at 3 days. The maximum impact parameter for the second planet is (R_star - R_planet)/R_star times the first planet&#39;s impact parameter. The radius of the star is 1.5 R_sun, and the planet radius is 2.5 R_earth. We convert Earth radii to solar radii: 1 R_earth = 0.0091577 R_sun approximately. So 2.5 R_earth = 0.0229 R_sun. The maximum impact parameter for the second planet is (1.5 - 0.0229)/1.5 = 0.984. The first planet&#39;s impact parameter is 0.2 at 3 days. The impact parameter scales linearly with semi-major axis, which scales with P^(2/3) (Kepler&#39;s third law). So, b2 = b1 * (P2/P1)^(2/3). We want b2 &lt;= 0.984. So 0.2 * (P2/3)^(2/3) &lt;= 0.984. (P2/3)^(2/3) &lt;= 0.984/0.2 = 4.92. Raise both sides to the 3/2 power: P2/3 &lt;= 4.92^(3/2) = 4.92^(1.5). Calculate 4.92^(1.5): sqrt(4.92) ~ 2.22, 2.22^3 ~ 10.9. So P2/3 &lt;= 10.9, P2 &lt;= 32.7 days. Among the choices, ~33.5 days is closest to 32.7 days. Therefore, the answer is choice 2, ~33.5 days.
