Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Compute a1/R* from P1=3 d and R*=1.5 R⊙: a1≃0.0408 AU, R*=0.00698 AU ⇒ a1/R*≈5.85. Given b1=0.2 ⇒ cos i=0.2/5.85≈0.03419. For planet 2: b2=(a2/R*) cos i ≤1+Rp2/R*≈1.01526 ⇒ a2/R*≤1.01526/0.03419≈29.7 ⇒5.85(P2/3)2/3=29.7 ⇒(P2/3)2/3≈5.077 ⇒P2≈3×5.0773/2≈34.3 d. Using full occultation limit b2≤1−Rp2/R* gives P2≈32.7 d. Closest choice ≃33.5 d.
