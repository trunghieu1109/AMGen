Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: For N→∞ the aperture is a circle of radius a (apothem→radius). The diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern: intensity zeros at k a θ_n equals the n-th zero of J1. First zero: x1=3.8317 gives θ1 = x1/(k a) = (3.8317/(2π))λ/a ≃0.6096λ/a ≃0.610λ/a. Second zero: x2=7.0156 gives θ2 ≃1.1163λ/a. The angular spacing between first two minima: θ2−θ1 ≃(1.1163−0.6096)λ/a ≃0.5067λ/a ≃0.506λ/a, corresponding to choice D).
