Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The apothem a becomes the radius of the circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk pattern. The first minimum in the Airy pattern occurs at an angle \\( \\theta_1 \\) given by \\( 1.22 \\lambda / D \\), where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the apothem a is the radius, the diameter D is 2a. Therefore, the angle for the first minimum is \\( \\theta_1 = 1.22 \\lambda / (2a) \\). The second minimum occurs at \\( \\theta_2 = 2.23 \\lambda / (2a) \\). The angular distance between the first two minima is \\( \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = (2.23 - 1.22) \\lambda / (2a) = 1.01 \\lambda / (2a) = 0.505 \\lambda / a \\). However, the closest choice is 0.506 \\lambda / a.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
