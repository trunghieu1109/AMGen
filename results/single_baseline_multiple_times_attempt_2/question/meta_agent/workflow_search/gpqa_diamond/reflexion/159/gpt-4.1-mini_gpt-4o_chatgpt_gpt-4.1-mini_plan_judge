Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The apothem a becomes the radius of the circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk pattern. The first minimum in the Airy pattern occurs at an angle \( \theta_1 \) given by \( 1.22 \lambda / D \), where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the apothem a is the radius, the diameter D is 2a. Therefore, the angle for the first minimum is \( \theta_1 = 1.22 \lambda / (2a) \). The second minimum occurs at \( \theta_2 = 2.23 \lambda / (2a) \). The angular distance between the first two minima is \( \theta_2 - \theta_1 = (2.23 - 1.22) \lambda / (2a) = 1.01 \lambda / (2a) = 0.505 \lambda / a \). However, the closest choice is 0.506 \lambda / a.
