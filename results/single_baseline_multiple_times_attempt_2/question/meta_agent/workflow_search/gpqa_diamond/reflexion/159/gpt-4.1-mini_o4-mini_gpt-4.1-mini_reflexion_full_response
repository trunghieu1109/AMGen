Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='For N→∞ the aperture is a circle of radius a (apothem→radius). The diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern: intensity zeros at k a θ_n equals the n-th zero of J1. First zero: x1=3.8317 gives θ1 = x1/(k a) = (3.8317/(2π))λ/a ≃0.6096λ/a ≃0.610λ/a. Second zero: x2=7.0156 gives θ2 ≃1.1163λ/a. The angular spacing between first two minima: θ2−θ1 ≃(1.1163−0.6096)λ/a ≃0.5067λ/a ≃0.506λ/a, corresponding to choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
