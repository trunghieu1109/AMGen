Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, releasing 3 GeV as kinetic energy. The fragments have rest masses m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. In the center of mass frame, the kinetic energies are equal, so each has 1.5 GeV. In the lab frame, the more massive fragment's kinetic energy T1 is calculated using relativistic formulas. The classical approximation for T1 is (1/2) * (2m) * v^2. The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is found to be 5 MeV.
