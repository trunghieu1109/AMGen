Question: {'question': 'An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ERnq', content='Initial nucleus: M c^2=300\u2009GeV. Fragments: m1+m2=0.99M=297\u2009GeV and m1=2m2 ⇒ m1=198\u2009GeV, m2=99\u2009GeV. Q=(300−297)=3\u2009GeV total KE. Relativistic E1=(M^2+m1^2−m2^2)/(2M)=(300^2+198^2−99^2)/(600)=199.005\u2009GeV ⇒ T1=E1−m1=1.005\u2009GeV. Non‐relativistic T1_nr=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3·(99/297)=1.000\u2009GeV.
