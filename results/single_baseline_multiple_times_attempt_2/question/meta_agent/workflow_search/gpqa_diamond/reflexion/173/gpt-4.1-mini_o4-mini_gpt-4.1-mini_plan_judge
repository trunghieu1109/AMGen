Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Initial nucleus: M c^2=300 GeV. Fragments: m1+m2=0.99M=297 GeV and m1=2m2 ⇒ m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV. Q=(300−297)=3 GeV total KE. Relativistic E1=(M^2+m1^2−m2^2)/(2M)=(300^2+198^2−99^2)/(600)=199.005 GeV ⇒ T1=E1−m1=1.005 GeV. Non‐relativistic T1_nr=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3·(99/297)=1.000 GeV. Difference ≈0.005 GeV=5 MeV.
