Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ERnq', content='Given: Initial nucleus mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. The total rest mass after fission is 99% of the initial mass, so 1% of the mass is converted into kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy T_total = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. The fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let m2 = m, then m1 = 2m, and m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M and m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M. The kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments. Using relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment T1 is slightly different from the classical approximation. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy for the more massive fragment is asked. The difference is on the order of MeV, given the options. Calculations show the difference is about 5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
