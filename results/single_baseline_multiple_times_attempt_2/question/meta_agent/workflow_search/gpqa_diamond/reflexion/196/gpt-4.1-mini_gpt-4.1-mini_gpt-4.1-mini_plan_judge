Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3400-2500 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group in the starting compound. The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 and the 1H NMR signals at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals correspond to a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces carboxylic acids to the corresponding alkyl groups, removing the carboxylic acid functionality. Therefore, the final product will be an alkylbenzene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group para to each other. Among the choices, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene fits this description. Hence, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
