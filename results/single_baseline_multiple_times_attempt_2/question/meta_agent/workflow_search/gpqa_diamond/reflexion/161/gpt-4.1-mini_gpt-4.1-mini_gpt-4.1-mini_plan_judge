proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2). This is a conformal metric on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. The factor 32 / (4 - r^2) with r^2 = x^2 + y^2 suggests a metric with a singularity at r^2 = 4, i.e., at the boundary of the disk of radius 2. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 under this metric. The area element dA is given by sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Here, the metric tensor is conformally flat with conformal factor Omega^2 = 32 / (4 - r^2). So, dA = Omega^2 dx dy = (32 / (4 - r^2)) dx dy. In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dtheta, so dA = (32 / (4 - r^2)) r dr dtheta. The total area A is the integral over the disk of radius 2: A = ∫_{theta=0}^{2pi} ∫_{r=0}^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr dtheta. The angular integral gives 2pi. The radial integral is ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr. Substitute u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr => r dr = -du/2. When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^0 (32 / u) * (-du/2) = -16 ∫_4^0 (1/u) du = 16 ∫_0^4 (1/u) du, which diverges to infinity because of the singularity at u=0 (r=2). Therefore, the area is infinite. Among the choices, '+\infty' corresponds to infinite area.
