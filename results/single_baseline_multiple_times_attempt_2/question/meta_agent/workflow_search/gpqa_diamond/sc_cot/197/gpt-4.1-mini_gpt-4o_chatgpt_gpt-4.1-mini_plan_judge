proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species. We have the stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes: β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN]) = 9, β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co][SCN]^2) = 40, β3 = [Co(SCN)3] / ([Co][SCN]^3) = 63, and β4 = [Co(SCN)4] / ([Co][SCN]^4) = 16. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

The total concentration of cobalt species is given by:
[Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c(Co) = 10^-2 M.

Using the stability constants, we express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of [Co]:
[Co(SCN)] = β1[Co][SCN] = 9[Co](0.1),
[Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co][SCN]^2 = 40[Co](0.1)^2,
[Co(SCN)3] = β3[Co][SCN]^3 = 63[Co](0.1)^3,
[Co(SCN)4] = β4[Co][SCN]^4 = 16[Co](0.1)^4.

Substituting these into the total concentration equation gives:
[Co] + 0.9[Co] + 0.4[Co] + 0.063[Co] + 0.0016[Co] = 10^-2.

Solving for [Co], we find:
[Co](1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 10^-2,
[Co](2.3646) = 10^-2,
[Co] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 4.23 x 10^-3 M.

Now, calculate [Co(SCN)2]:
[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4[Co] = 0.4 x 4.23 x 10^-3 ≈ 1.692 x 10^-3 M.

The percentage of the Co(SCN)2 complex is:
([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) x 100% = (1.692 x 10^-3 / 10^-2) x 100% ≈ 16.9%.

Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is 16.9%.
