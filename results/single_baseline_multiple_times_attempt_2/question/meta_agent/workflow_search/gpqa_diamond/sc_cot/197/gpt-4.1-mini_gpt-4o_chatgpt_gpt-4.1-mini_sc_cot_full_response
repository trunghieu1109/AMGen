Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent c506', content='To solve this problem, we need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species. We have the stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes: β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN]) = 9, β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co][SCN]^2) = 40, β3 = [Co(SCN)3] / ([Co][SCN]^3) = 63, and β4 = [Co(SCN)4] / ([Co][SCN]^4) = 16. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt species is given by:\n[Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c(Co) = 10^-2 M.\n\nUsing the stability constants, we express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of [Co]:\n[Co(SCN)] = β1[Co][SCN] = 9[Co](0.1),\n[Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co][SCN]^2 = 40[Co](0.1)^2,\n[Co(SCN)3] = β3[Co][SCN]^3 = 63[Co](0.1)^3,\n[Co(SCN)4] = β4[Co][SCN]^4 = 16[Co](0.1)^4.\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation gives:\n[Co] + 0.9[Co] + 0.4[Co] + 0.063[Co] + 0.0016[Co] = 10^-2.\n\nSolving for [Co], we find:\n[Co](1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 10^-2,\n[Co](2.3646) = 10^-2,\n[Co] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 4.23 x 10^-3 M.\n\nNow, calculate [Co(SCN)2]:\n[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4[Co] = 0.4 x 4.23 x 10^-3 ≈ 1.692 x 10^-3 M.\n\nThe percentage of the Co(SCN)2 complex is:\n([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) x 100% = (1.692 x 10^-3 / 10^-2) x 100% ≈ 16.9%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
