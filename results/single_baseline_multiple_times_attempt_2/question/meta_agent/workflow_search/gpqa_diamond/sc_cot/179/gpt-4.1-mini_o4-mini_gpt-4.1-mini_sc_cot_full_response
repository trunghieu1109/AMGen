Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Awku', content='We have one central charge q and 12 charges on a sphere of radius R=2\u2009m. Total U=U_center–shell+U_shell–shell. U_center–shell=12·k·q^2/R with q=2e gives ≃5.54×10^-27\u2009J. For the 12 shell charges at the Thomson minimum (icosahedral) there are 66 pairs; estimating an average separation ~3\u2009m gives U_shell–shell≈k·q^2·66/3≈2.25×10^-26\u2009J. Sum ≃2.80×10^-26\u2009J, closest to 2.822×10^-26\u2009J.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
