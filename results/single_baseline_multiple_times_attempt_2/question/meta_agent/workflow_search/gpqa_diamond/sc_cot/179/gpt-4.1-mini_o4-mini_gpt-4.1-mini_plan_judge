Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have one central charge q and 12 charges on a sphere of radius R=2 m. Total U=U_center–shell+U_shell–shell. U_center–shell=12·k·q^2/R with q=2e gives ≃5.54×10^-27 J. For the 12 shell charges at the Thomson minimum (icosahedral) there are 66 pairs; estimating an average separation ~3 m gives U_shell–shell≈k·q^2·66/3≈2.25×10^-26 J. Sum ≃2.80×10^-26 J, closest to 2.822×10^-26 J.
