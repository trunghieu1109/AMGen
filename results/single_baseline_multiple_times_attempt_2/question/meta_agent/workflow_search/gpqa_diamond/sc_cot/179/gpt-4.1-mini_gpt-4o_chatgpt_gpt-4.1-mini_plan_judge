Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. We have 12 charges each with charge 2e at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and a 13th charge of 2e fixed at P. The potential energy due to one charge at a distance r from another charge is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Here, q1 = q2 = 2e, and r = 2 m. The charge of an electron e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C. Therefore, the potential energy for one pair is U = (8.988 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. There are 12 such pairs, so the total energy is 12 times this value. Calculating this gives the total energy of the system.
