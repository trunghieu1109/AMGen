proposed answer: There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. One charge is fixed at point P, and 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system. The energy here refers to the electrostatic potential energy of the system. The potential energy U between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (k = 8.988 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2), and e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C. First, calculate the energy from the 12 charges to the charge at P: U1 = 12 * k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 = 12 * k * 4e^2 / 2 = 12 * 2 * k * e^2 = 24 * k * e^2. Next, calculate the energy among the 12 charges on the circle of radius 2 m. The minimum energy configuration will be when these 12 charges are equally spaced on the circle. The distance between adjacent charges on the circle is d = 2 * 2 * sin(pi/12) = 4 * sin(15 degrees) = 4 * 0.258819 = 1.035. But the total potential energy is sum over all pairs: U2 = sum_{i<j} k * q_i * q_j / r_ij. Since all charges are identical and equally spaced, the total energy among the 12 charges is U2 = k * (2e)^2 * sum_{i<j} 1/r_ij. The sum of 1/r_ij over all pairs can be found numerically or approximated. The total number of pairs among 12 charges is 12*11/2=66. The average distance between charges will be larger than the nearest neighbor distance. For a rough estimate, let's consider only the nearest neighbor interactions: 12 pairs at 1.035 m, so U2_approx = 12 * k * 4e^2 / 1.035 = approx 12 * k * 4e^2 / 1.035. Adding U1 and U2_approx gives an estimate of total energy. Calculate k * e^2 = 8.988 x 10^9 * (1.602 x 10^-19)^2 = 8.988 x 10^9 * 2.566 x 10^-38 = 2.306 x 10^-28 J. Then U1 = 24 * 2.306 x 10^-28 = 5.534 x 10^-27 J. U2_approx = 12 * 4 * 2.306 x 10^-28 / 1.035 = 12 * 4 * 2.229 x 10^-28 = 12 * 8.916 x 10^-28 = 1.07 x 10^-26 J. Total U = U1 + U2_approx = 5.534 x 10^-27 + 1.07 x 10^-26 = 1.62 x 10^-26 J. Among the options, 2.822 x 10^-26 is closest to this estimate. So the answer is A).
