Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have state vector v=(–1,2,1)^T. Normalize: ||v||^2=1+4+1=6, so |ψ>=v/√6. Observable P has matrix M with elements M_{12}=M_{21}=M_{23}=M_{32}=1/√2, others zero. Its eigenvalues are λ=1,0,–1; the eigenvector for λ=0 is proportional to (1,0,–1)^T. Normalize this eigenvector: |φ0>=(1,0,–1)/√2. Probability to measure λ=0 is |<φ0|ψ>|^2. Compute inner product: <φ0|ψ>=(1/√2)(1,0,–1)·(1/√6)(–1,2,1)= (1/√12)[(1)(–1)+(0)(2)+(–1)(1)]=(–2)/√12=–1/√3. Square gives 1/3.
