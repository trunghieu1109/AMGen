proposed answer: First, normalize the state vector |psi> = (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Next, the observable P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We want the probability that the measurement yields 0, so we need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Find eigenvalues of P:
Letâ€™s denote x = 1/sqrt(2).

The characteristic polynomial det(P - lambda*I) = 0:

| -lambda, x,       0    |
|   x,   -lambda,  x    |
|   0,    x,    -lambda |

Calculate the determinant:
= -lambda * | -lambda, x; x, -lambda | - x * | x, x; 0, -lambda | + 0
= -lambda * (lambda^2 - x^2) - x * ( -x * lambda )
= -lambda (lambda^2 - x^2) + x^2 * lambda
= -lambda^3 + lambda x^2 + lambda x^2
= -lambda^3 + 2 lambda x^2

Set equal to zero:
-lambda^3 + 2 lambda x^2 = 0
lambda(-lambda^2 + 2 x^2) = 0

So eigenvalues are lambda = 0 or lambda^2 = 2 x^2 = 2 * (1/2) = 1
Thus, eigenvalues are 0, +1, -1.

Now find eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0:
(P - 0*I) v = 0 => P v = 0

Write equations:
0 * v1 + x * v2 + 0 * v3 = 0 => x v2 = 0 => v2 = 0
x v1 + 0 * v2 + x v3 = 0 => x v1 + x v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3
0 * v1 + x v2 + 0 * v3 = 0 => same as first equation

So eigenvector corresponding to 0 is v = (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3.
Let v3 = t, then v = (-t, 0, t) = t(-1, 0, 1).

Normalize this eigenvector:
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector |phi_0> = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))

Probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is |<phi_0|psi>|^2

Calculate inner product <phi_0|psi>:
= (-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6))
= (1 / sqrt(12)) + 0 + (1 / sqrt(12))
= 2 / sqrt(12) = 2 / (2 * sqrt(3)) = 1 / sqrt(3)

Probability = |1 / sqrt(3)|^2 = 1/3

Hence, the probability is 1/3.
