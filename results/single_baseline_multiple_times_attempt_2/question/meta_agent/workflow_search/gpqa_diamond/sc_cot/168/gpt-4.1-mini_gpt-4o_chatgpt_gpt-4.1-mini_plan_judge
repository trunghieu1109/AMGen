Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy is shared between the two E particles and the two V particles, leading to a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles up to an endpoint Q. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M carries away some energy, but the energy distribution among the E particles is still continuous because M is massless and does not discretize the energy levels. The energy available to the E particles is reduced because M carries away some energy. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint decreases because less energy is available to the E particles.
