Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the presence of two lighter particles E and two particles V results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles due to the distribution of available energy among multiple particles. The endpoint Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal energy.

In the variant decay, one exotic massless particle M replaces the two V particles. Since M is massless and only one such particle is emitted instead of two V particles, the kinematics change. The total available energy for the E particles can increase because fewer particles share the energy, and the massless nature of M allows more energy to be carried away as kinetic energy.

However, the spectrum remains continuous because the energies of the E particles can still vary depending on the momentum distribution among E and M. The endpoint energy of the E particles increases because the energy carried away by the massless M particle allows the E particles to reach higher energies than before.

Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
