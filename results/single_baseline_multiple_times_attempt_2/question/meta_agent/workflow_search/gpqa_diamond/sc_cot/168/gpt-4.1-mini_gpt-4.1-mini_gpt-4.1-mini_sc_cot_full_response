Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the presence of two lighter particles E and two particles V results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles due to the distribution of available energy among multiple particles. The endpoint Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal energy.\n\nIn the variant decay, one exotic massless particle M replaces the two V particles. Since M is massless and only one such particle is emitted instead of two V particles, the kinematics change. The total available energy for the E particles can increase because fewer particles share the energy, and the massless nature of M allows more energy to be carried away as kinetic energy.\n\nHowever, the spectrum remains continuous because the energies of the E particles can still vary depending on the momentum distribution among E and M. The endpoint energy of the E particles increases because the energy carried away by the massless M particle allows the E particles to reach higher energies than before.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
