    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;}

    <pre>In the original decay, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy is shared between the two E particles and the two V particles, leading to a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles up to an endpoint Q. In the variant decay 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M carries away some energy, but the energy distribution among the E particles is still continuous because M is massless and does not discretize the energy levels. The energy available to the E particles is reduced because M carries away some energy. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint decreases because less energy is available to the E particles.
