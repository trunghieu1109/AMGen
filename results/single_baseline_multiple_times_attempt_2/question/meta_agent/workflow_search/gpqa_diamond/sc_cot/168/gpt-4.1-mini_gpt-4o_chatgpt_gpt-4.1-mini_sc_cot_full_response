Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V.

In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', 'choice1': 'The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', 'choice2': 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', 'choice3': 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', 'choice4': 'The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8', content='In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy is shared between the two E particles and the two V particles, leading to a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles up to an endpoint Q. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M carries away some energy, but the energy distribution among the E particles is still continuous because M is massless and does not discretize the energy levels. The energy available to the E particles is reduced because M carries away some energy. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint decreases because less energy is available to the E particles.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
