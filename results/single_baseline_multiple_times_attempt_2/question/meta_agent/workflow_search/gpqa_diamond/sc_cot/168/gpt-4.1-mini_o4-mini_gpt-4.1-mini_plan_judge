Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The original decay 2A→2B+2E+2V is a four–body decay (two electrons plus two neutrinos), so the sum energy of the two electrons is continuous up to the endpoint Q, where both (nearly) massless neutrinos carry zero energy. In the variant decay 2A→2B+2E+M, there are still three final particles (two electrons plus one massless M), so the sum–energy spectrum of the electrons remains continuous. Since the original neutrinos have a tiny mass m_ν but M is strictly massless, the kinematic endpoint for the electron sum energy increases slightly (by roughly 2m_ν), giving a continuous spectrum with an adjusted shape and a higher endpoint.
