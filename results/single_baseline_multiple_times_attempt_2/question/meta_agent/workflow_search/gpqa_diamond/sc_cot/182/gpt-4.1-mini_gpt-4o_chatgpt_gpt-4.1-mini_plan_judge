Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has the following groups: a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH=CH2), a cyclohexene ring, and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, these conditions typically lead to the reduction of double bonds and the conversion of oxygen-containing groups to alkanes. The formyl group (CHO) and the carboxylic acid group (COOH) will likely be reduced to CH3 groups, and the double bonds in the vinyl group and cyclohexene ring will be saturated. Therefore, the product is likely a fully saturated hydrocarbon with no double bonds or rings, giving it an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 0.
