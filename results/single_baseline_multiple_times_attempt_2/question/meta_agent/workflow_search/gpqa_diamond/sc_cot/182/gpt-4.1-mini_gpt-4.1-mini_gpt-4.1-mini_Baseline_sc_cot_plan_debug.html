    <pre>The given compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI typically reduces aldehyde and vinyl groups to alkyl groups and can also reduce double bonds. The original compound has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), an aldehyde group (formyl), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a carboxylic acid group. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as the number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds minus the number of hydrogens compared to the saturated alkane. Initially, the compound has 1 ring, 2 double bonds (one in the ring and one vinyl group), and 1 aldehyde (counted as a double bond), and 1 carboxylic acid (which has a double bond to oxygen). So total IHD is 1 (ring) + 1 (alkene in ring) + 1 (vinyl double bond) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (carboxylic acid C=O) = 5. After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, aldehyde and vinyl groups are reduced to alkyl groups, and double bonds in the ring may be reduced as well, but carboxylic acid remains intact. So, the double bonds and aldehyde groups are reduced, leaving only the ring and the carboxylic acid double bond. The IHD of the product is 1 (ring) + 1 (carboxylic acid C=O) = 2. However, since the choices do not include 2, let&#39;s re-examine. The vinyl group and aldehyde are reduced, so their double bonds are removed. The ring double bond is also likely reduced. The carboxylic acid double bond remains. So total IHD is 1 (ring) + 1 (carboxylic acid) = 2. But none of the choices is 2. Possibly the ring double bond is reduced, so no double bond in the ring, only ring and carboxylic acid double bond remain. So IHD = 1 (ring) + 1 (carboxylic acid) = 2. The choices are 1, 3, 0, and 5. 3 is closest to 2. Maybe the aldehyde is converted to an alkane, so no double bond there, vinyl is reduced to alkane, ring double bond reduced to alkane. So only ring and carboxylic acid double bond remain. So IHD is 2. Since 2 is not an option, the closest is 3, possibly counting the ring and two double bonds (carboxylic acid and something else). Therefore, the answer is 3.
