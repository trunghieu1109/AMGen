Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Red P/HI reduces both carbonyls to hydrocarbons: –CHO → –CH3 and –COOH → –CH3, leaving the ring C=C and the vinyl double bond intact. The product has one ring (1 IHD), one ring C=C (1), and one vinyl C=C (1) = total 3.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
