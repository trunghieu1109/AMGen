Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mPTt', content="To determine which issues are common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, I need to consider each option: 1) Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors when data from different sources are combined. 2) The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion is a common issue when dealing with chromosome naming conventions. 3) Reference assembly mismatch can cause errors if the wrong reference genome is used. 4) Incorrect ID conversion can lead to misinterpretation of results if gene or variant identifiers are converted incorrectly. All these issues are known to cause problems in genomics data analysis. Therefore, 'All of the above' is a plausible answer.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
