Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves the excitation of atoms in the photospheres of two stars, which is related to their temperatures. The ratio of excited states of atoms can be described by the Boltzmann equation, which in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is given by: n_2/n_1 = (g_2/g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T)), where n_2 and n_1 are the number densities of atoms in the excited and ground states respectively, g_2 and g_1 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have: n_2/n_1 (star_1) = 2 * n_2/n_1 (star_2). Assuming g_2 = g_1 for simplicity, this reduces to: exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get: -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2). Rearranging gives: ln(2) = ΔE / k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This matches choice D) when simplified.
