    <pre>The problem describes two stars with iron atoms in their photospheres. The number of atoms excited to a specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in an excited state relative to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann distribution: n_i / n_0 = exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T)), where k_B is Boltzmann&#39;s constant and T is the temperature.

Given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:

n_i1 / n_i2 = 2 = exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) = exp[-ΔE / k_B (1/T_1 - 1/T_2)]

Taking natural logarithm:
ln(2) = -ΔE / k_B (1/T_1 - 1/T_2) = ΔE / k_B (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)

Rearranged:
ln(2) = (ΔE / k_B) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)

Since ΔE / k_B is a constant, the equation relates ln(2) to (1/T_2 - 1/T_1).

Comparing the form of the options, the correct one should be:
ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)

This matches choice4.
