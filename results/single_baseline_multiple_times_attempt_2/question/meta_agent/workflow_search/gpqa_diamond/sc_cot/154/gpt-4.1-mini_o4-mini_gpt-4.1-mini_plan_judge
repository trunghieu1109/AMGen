Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The state in the P_z basis is ψ = [−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2] with probabilities |a|²=1/4, |b|²=1/2, |c|²=1/4. The eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, −ℏ. 
〈P_z〉 = (1/4)ℏ + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)(−ℏ) = 0. 
〈P_z²〉 = (1/4)ℏ² + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)ℏ² = (1/2)ℏ². 
Var(P_z)=〈P_z²〉−〈P_z〉²=(1/2)ℏ². 
Thus ΔP_z=√((1/2)ℏ²)=ℏ/√2.
