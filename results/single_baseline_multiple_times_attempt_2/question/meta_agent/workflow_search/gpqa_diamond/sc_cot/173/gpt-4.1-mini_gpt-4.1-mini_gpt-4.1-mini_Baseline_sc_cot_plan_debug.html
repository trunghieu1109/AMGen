    <pre>Given: initial nucleus mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 * m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. So the total rest mass decreases by 1%. The mass defect corresponds to energy released as kinetic energy. The kinetic energy released is E = (1 - 0.99) * M * c^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV total kinetic energy. Let m2 = m, then m1 = 2m, and m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M. Conservation of momentum: p1 = -p2. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_i^2 = (m_i c^2)^2 + (p_i c)^2. Total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = (E1 - m1 c^2) + (E2 - m2 c^2). Need to find T1 exactly and classically. Classically, kinetic energy T = p^2 / (2m). Using non-relativistic approximation, T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1). Relativistic kinetic energy is E1 - m1 c^2. The difference between correct T1 and classical T1 is to be found. The difference is about several MeV. Doing detailed calculations shows difference is about 5 MeV. Hence the answer is B).
