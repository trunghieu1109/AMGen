Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rkYI', content='We have an initial nucleus mass M at rest, rest energy 300\u2009GeV. It splits into two fragments of rest masses m1 and m2 with m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99M, so m1=0.66M, m2=0.33M. The mass defect Δm=0.01M gives total kinetic energy 0.01·300\u2009GeV=3\u2009GeV. \n\nNonrelatively, kinetic energies split in inverse proportion to masses: T1_nr =3\u2009GeV·(m2/(m1+m2))=3·(0.33/0.99)=1.00\u2009GeV.\n\nRelativistically, for two-body decay at rest E1=(M^2+m1^2−m2^2)/(2M)·c^2 =((1+0.4356−0.1089)/2)M\u2009c^2=0.66335M\u2009c^2, so T1=E1−m1c^2=(0.66335−0.66)M\u2009c^2=0.00335·300\u2009GeV≈1.005\u2009GeV. \n\nThe difference is ≈1.005\u2009GeV−1.000\u2009GeV=0.005\u2009GeV=5\u2009MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
