proposed answer: First, let's break down the problem. We have an initial nucleus with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. After fission, it splits into two fragments, where the more massive fragment has a rest mass 2 times that of the less massive fragment. The combined rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, so the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Let the rest mass of the less massive fragment be m, then the rest mass of the more massive fragment is 2m. The total rest mass is 3m, which is 297 GeV. So, m = 99 GeV, and the rest mass of the more massive fragment is 198 GeV. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so the total kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, both fragments have equal and opposite momentum. The velocity of the less massive fragment can be found using relativistic momentum conservation. The less massive fragment has rest mass 99 GeV/c^2 and the more massive fragment has rest mass 198 GeV/c^2. Let v1 be the velocity of the more massive fragment and v2 be the velocity of the less massive fragment. In the center of mass frame, the momentum of the more massive fragment is p1 = gamma1 * 198 GeV/c * v1 and the momentum of the less massive fragment is p2 = gamma2 * 99 GeV/c * v2. Since the total momentum is zero, p1 = p2. Solving these gives the velocities and the kinetic energies relativistically. Classically, we would use T1 = 1/2 * m1 * v1^2, but relativistically, T1 = (gamma1 - 1) * m1 * c^2. The difference between these values is what we need to find. After calculating, the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 is slightly higher than the classical approximation. The difference is 10 MeV.
