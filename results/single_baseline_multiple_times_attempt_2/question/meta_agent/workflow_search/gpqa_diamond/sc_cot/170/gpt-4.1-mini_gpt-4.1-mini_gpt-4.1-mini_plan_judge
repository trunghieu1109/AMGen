proposed answer: The question involves electrophilic substitution on various substituted benzene compounds and asks to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) direct electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions, often giving a higher para-isomer yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct substitution to the meta position, reducing para-isomer formation.

Let's analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) - methyl is an EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) - ester is an EWG, meta directing, lower para yield.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) - halogen is deactivating but ortho/para directing, moderate para yield.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) - strong EWG, meta directing, very low para yield.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) - alkyl is EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) - carboxyl is EWG, meta directing, low para yield.

Ranking from lowest to highest para yield likely follows the strength of directing effects:
Strong meta directors (lowest para): NO2 (4) < COOH (6) < COOC2H5 (2)
Halogen (3) next
Then alkyl groups: CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5)

Therefore, order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5

Comparing to choices:
Choice 4: 4<6<2<1<5<3 (close but 3 is last, which is inconsistent since Cl is ortho/para directing)
Choice 2: 4<2<6<3<1<5 (2 and 6 swapped)
Choice 1: 3<5<1<6<2<4 (3 first, which is inconsistent)
Choice 3: 6<2<4<5<1<3 (order of 4 and 2 swapped and 3 last)

Choice 2 matches best with 4<2<6<3<1<5, which aligns reasonably with the expected order since ester (2) is slightly stronger EWG than COOH (6).

Therefore, the best answer is choice 2.
