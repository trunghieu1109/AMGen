proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic substitution reactions. Substituents can be ortho/para-directing or meta-directing, and they can also be activating or deactivating. 

1) C6H5-CH3 has a methyl group, which is an ortho/para-directing and activating group. It will favor the para position. 
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 has an ester group, which is meta-directing and deactivating. It will not favor the para position. 
3) C6H5-Cl has a chlorine group, which is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. It will slightly favor the para position. 
4) C6H5-NO2 has a nitro group, which is meta-directing and strongly deactivating. It will not favor the para position. 
5) C6H5-C2H5 has an ethyl group, which is ortho/para-directing and activating. It will favor the para position. 
6) C6H5-COOH has a carboxylic acid group, which is meta-directing and deactivating. It will not favor the para position. 

We need to arrange these substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer. Meta-directing groups will have lower para yields, while ortho/para-directing groups will have higher para yields. 

Considering the directing effects:
- 4 (C6H5-NO2) will have the lowest para yield.
- 6 (C6H5-COOH) and 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5) will also have low para yields, but 2 might have a slightly higher yield than 6 due to the ester group being less deactivating than the carboxylic acid.
- 1 (C6H5-CH3), 5 (C6H5-C2H5), and 3 (C6H5-Cl) will have higher para yields, with 3 being the highest among them due to the ortho/para-directing nature of chlorine.

Thus, the order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.
