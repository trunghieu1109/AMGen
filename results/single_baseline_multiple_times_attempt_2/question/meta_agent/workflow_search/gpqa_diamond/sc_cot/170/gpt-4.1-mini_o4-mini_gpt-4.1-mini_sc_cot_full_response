Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IrHm', content='Substituents that are meta directors (NO₂, COOH, COOR) give very low para yields in increasing order: NO₂ < COOH < COOR. Ortho/para directors then follow: alkyl (toluene and ethylbenzene) give moderate para yields (toluene < ethylbenzene because ethyl is bulkier, so less ortho, more para). Chlorine, though deactivating, directs ortho/para by resonance and has less steric hindrance than alkyls at ortho, so gives the highest para fraction. Thus the order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, which corresponds to choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
