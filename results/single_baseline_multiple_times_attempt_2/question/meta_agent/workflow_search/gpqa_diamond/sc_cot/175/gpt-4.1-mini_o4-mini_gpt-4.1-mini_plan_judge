Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: 1. Initial state |ψ⟩=(-1,2,1), normalized to (−1,2,1)/√6.
2. Operator P has eigenvalues +1,0,−1. The eigenvector for 0 is v₀=(1,0,−1)/√2.
3. Probability P=0: |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²=[(−1−1)/(√6√2)]²=(−2/√12)²=1/3.
4. After collapse to v₀, measure Q with eigenvector for −1 as e₃=(0,0,1). Probability Q=−1 given v₀: |⟨e₃|v₀⟩|²=(−1/√2)²=1/2.
5. Joint probability = (1/3)×(1/2)=1/6.
