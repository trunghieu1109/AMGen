Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: First, the state vector is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The operator P has eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We want the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q. We must find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, project |ψ> onto it, normalize, then measure Q and find the probability of getting -1. P matrix is [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. Find eigenvalues of P: characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. The eigenvalues are λ = 1, 0, -1. For λ=0, find eigenvector v. Solve P v = 0. From the matrix, the vector v = (1, 0, -1) satisfies P v = 0. Normalize v: norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so v0 = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Probability of measuring 0 for P is |<v0|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>. Compute <v0|ψ> = (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1) = (-1/√2) - (1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2*2/2 = -√2. So |<v0|ψ>|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2. Norm of ψ is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 +1) = sqrt(6). So total probability of measuring 0 for P is 2 / 6 = 1/3. After measuring P=0, the state collapses to v0. Now measure Q. Q matrix is diag(1,0,-1). Probability of measuring -1 is |<q_{-1}|v0>|^2, where |q_{-1}> is the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1, which is (0, 0, 1). Compute <q_{-1}|v0> = (0, 0, 1) * (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2. Probability = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Therefore, the joint probability is (prob of P=0) * (prob of Q=-1 given P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.
