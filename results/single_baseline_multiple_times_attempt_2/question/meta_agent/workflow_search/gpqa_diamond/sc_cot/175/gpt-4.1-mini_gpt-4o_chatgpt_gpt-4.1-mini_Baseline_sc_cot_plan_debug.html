    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of obtaining specific eigenvalues for the observables P and Q. First, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix corresponding to operator P. The matrix P is given by: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. We solve the characteristic equation det(P - lambda*I) = 0 to find the eigenvalues. Solving, we find the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, and -1. We then find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. For eigenvalue 0, the eigenvector is v_0 = [0, 1, 0]. We project the initial state vector |psi&gt; = [-1, 2, 1] onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. The probability is |&lt;v_0 | psi&gt;|^2 / ||psi||^2 = |(0, 1, 0) \cdot (-1, 2, 1)|^2 / (1 + 4 + 1) = |2|^2 / 6 = 4/6 = 2/3. Next, we consider the measurement of Q after obtaining 0 for P. The matrix Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the probability that the state |v_0&gt; = [0, 1, 0] collapses to the corresponding eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue -1. The eigenvector for Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is [0, 0, 1]. The projection of [0, 1, 0] onto [0, 0, 1] is 0, so the probability is 0. Hence, the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is 0.
