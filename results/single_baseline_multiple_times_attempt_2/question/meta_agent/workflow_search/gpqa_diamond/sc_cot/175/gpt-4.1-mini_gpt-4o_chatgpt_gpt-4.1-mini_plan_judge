Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of obtaining specific eigenvalues for the observables P and Q. First, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix corresponding to operator P. The matrix P is given by: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. We solve the characteristic equation det(P - lambda*I) = 0 to find the eigenvalues. Solving, we find the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, and -1. We then find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. For eigenvalue 0, the eigenvector is v_0 = [0, 1, 0]. We project the initial state vector |psi> = [-1, 2, 1] onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. The probability is |<v_0 | psi>|^2 / ||psi||^2 = |(0, 1, 0) \cdot (-1, 2, 1)|^2 / (1 + 4 + 1) = |2|^2 / 6 = 4/6 = 2/3. Next, we consider the measurement of Q after obtaining 0 for P. The matrix Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the probability that the state |v_0> = [0, 1, 0] collapses to the corresponding eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue -1. The eigenvector for Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is [0, 0, 1]. The projection of [0, 1, 0] onto [0, 0, 1] is 0, so the probability is 0. Hence, the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is 0.
