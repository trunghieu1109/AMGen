Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VWWJ', content='The problem involves a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating and radiating power. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function of the wavelength \\lambda and the angle \\theta. For a spheroidal distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern typically follows a dipole pattern, which can be expressed as proportional to sin^2(\\theta). The maximum power is radiated perpendicular to the axis (at \\theta = 90^0), and the power at any angle \\theta is proportional to sin^2(\\theta). At \\theta = 30^0, sin(30^0) = 1/2, so sin^2(30^0) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at \\theta = 30^0 is 1/4. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also proportional to \\lambda^(-4), according to the Larmor formula. Thus, the fraction is 1/4 and the form of f is \\lambda^(-4).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
