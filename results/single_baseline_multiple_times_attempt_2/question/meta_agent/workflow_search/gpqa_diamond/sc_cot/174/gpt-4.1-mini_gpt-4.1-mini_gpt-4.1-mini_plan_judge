Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone depends on the wavelength \lambda and the angle \theta relative to the z-axis. For an oscillating dipole (which a spheroidal charge distribution can be approximated as), the angular distribution of radiated power is proportional to sin^2(\theta), and the power dependence on wavelength is typically proportional to \lambda^{-4} (Rayleigh scattering-like dependence). The maximum power A occurs at \theta = 90^\circ (since sin^2(90^\circ) = 1). At \theta = 30^\circ, sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is 1/4. The wavelength dependence is \lambda^{-4}. So the correct choice is the one with fraction 1/4 and \lambda^{-4}, which corresponds to choice3.
