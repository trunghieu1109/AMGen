Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the relative masses of the two systems, we can use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity information. The period of the binary system and the amplitude of the radial velocity variations can be used to estimate the masses of the stars in the system. The formula for the total mass of a binary system in terms of the period (P) and the velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) is given by M1 + M2 = (P/2Ï€G)^(1/3) * (K1 + K2)^(2/3), where G is the gravitational constant. We have P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s for system_1, and P2 = 1 year, K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s for system_2. Converting periods to seconds and velocities to m/s, we calculate the mass ratio. The ratio (M1 + M2) / (M1' + M2') is approximately 0.4.
