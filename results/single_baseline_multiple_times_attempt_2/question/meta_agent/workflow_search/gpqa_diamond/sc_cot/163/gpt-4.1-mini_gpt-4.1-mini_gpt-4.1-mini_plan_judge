Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The period of system_1 is 2 years, and the period of system_2 is 1 year. The total mass of a binary system can be related to the orbital period and the size of the orbit through Kepler's third law: (M1 + M2) ∝ a^3 / P^2, where a is the semi-major axis, and P is the orbital period. The radial velocity amplitudes give information about the velocities of the stars, which relate to the size of the orbit and the masses. The sum of the masses can also be derived using the mass function and the velocity amplitudes. For a binary system, the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 satisfy M1 K1 = M2 K2, and the total mass M = M1 + M2 = (P (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG sin^3 i), ignoring inclination and constants for the ratio. Since both systems have eclipses, we can assume inclination i ~ 90°, so sin i ~ 1. The total mass scales as (K1 + K2)^3 * P. For system_1: K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, P = 2 years. For system_2: K1 + K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s, P = 1 year. So, ratio M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / (15625) = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2, or system_1 is less massive by a factor of about 0.4. The question asks: By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? The factor is ~0.4.
