proposed answer: First, determine the mass dimensions of each component in the Lagrangian. The field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \), the field \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2, and the gamma matrices are dimensionless. The Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \) has mass dimension 4. Therefore, \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). To make the interaction term have dimension 4, \( \kappa \) must have dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have a mass dimension \( \leq 0 \). Since \( \kappa \) has mass dimension -1, the theory is not renormalizable.
