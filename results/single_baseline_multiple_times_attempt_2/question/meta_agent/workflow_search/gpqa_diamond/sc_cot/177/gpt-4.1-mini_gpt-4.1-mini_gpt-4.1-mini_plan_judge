proposed answer: First, determine the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). The Lagrangian density in 4-dimensional spacetime has mass dimension 4. The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. The matrix \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless since it is constructed from gamma matrices. So, the mass dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 7. Therefore, \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 7 = -3 \) to make the interaction term have dimension 4. However, this seems inconsistent with the provided options, so let's re-express carefully: \( \bar{\psi} \) has dimension 3/2, \( \psi \) has 3/2, so \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has dimension 3, and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension 2, total 5. Thus, \( \kappa \) must have dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). Since \( \kappa \) has negative mass dimension, the coupling is nonrenormalizable (operators with negative mass dimension couplings are nonrenormalizable). Therefore, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable.
