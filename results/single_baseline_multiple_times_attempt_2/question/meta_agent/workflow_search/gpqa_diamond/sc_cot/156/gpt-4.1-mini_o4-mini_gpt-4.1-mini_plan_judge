Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Retroviruses have an RNA genome. To detect them molecularly, you first reverse-transcribe the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), then use real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting specific viral sequences for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative diagnosis. Options involving DNA sequencing directly or antibody-based ELISA arenâ€™t optimal for early detection of active infection, and nested PCR based solely on symptoms lacks specificity and speed. Thus, cDNA sequencing plus real-time PCR is the best approach.
