Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The virus in question is a retrovirus, which has an RNA genome. To design a molecular diagnostic kit, the first step is to identify the viral genetic material. Since retroviruses have RNA genomes, direct DNA sequencing is not appropriate. Instead, the viral RNA must be reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) first. Therefore, cDNA sequencing is the correct approach. After identifying the viral sequence, a real-time PCR (qPCR) kit can be developed for quick and accurate detection. This method is sensitive, specific, and allows quantification of the viral load. Option 1 suggests DNA sequencing, which is not suitable for RNA viruses. Option 2 focuses on antibody detection, which is indirect and may not be as quick or specific in early infection. Option 3 relies on symptoms for virus identification, which is not precise. Hence, option 4 is the best approach.
