Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='Retroviruses have an RNA genome. To detect them molecularly, you first reverse-transcribe the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), then use real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting specific viral sequences for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative diagnosis. Options involving DNA sequencing directly or antibody-based ELISA arenâ€™t optimal for early detection of active infection, and nested PCR based solely on symptoms lacks specificity and speed. Thus, cDNA sequencing plus real-time PCR is the best approach.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
