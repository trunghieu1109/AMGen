Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^-9 m = 1 × 10^-10 m, v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. First, use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055 × 10^-34 Js. Calculate Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055 × 10^-34) / (2 × 1 × 10^-10) = 5.275 × 10^-25 kg·m/s. Now, ΔE ≈ v * Δp (since kinetic energy E = p²/2m, and small change in p corresponds to change in E). Calculate ΔE: ΔE = v * Δp = 2 × 10^8 * 5.275 × 10^-25 = 1.055 × 10^-16 J. So, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 10^-16 J.
