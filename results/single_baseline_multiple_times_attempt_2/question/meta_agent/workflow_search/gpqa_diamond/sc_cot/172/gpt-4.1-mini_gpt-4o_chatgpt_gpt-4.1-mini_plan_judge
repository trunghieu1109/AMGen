Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h/2π = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s). Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, we can find Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Once we have Δp, the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be estimated using ΔE = Δp*v, where v is the speed of the electron. Calculating these values: Δp ≥ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s / (2 × 0.1 × 10^(-9) m) = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. Then, ΔE = Δp*v = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s × 2 × 10^8 m/s = 1.0545718 × 10^(-16) J. Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron is approximately 10^(-16) J.
