Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to order nucleophiles in protic (aqueous) solvent by nucleophilicity. Thiolate (ethanethiolate) is highly nucleophilic due to polarizability and weak solvation, so it is top. Next is hydroxide (small, strongly basic). Then comes bulky alkoxide (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate), somewhat hindered. Propionate is resonance-stabilized, so less reactive. Neutral methanol is poorest. This gives 5,2,1,3,4, corresponding to choice1.
