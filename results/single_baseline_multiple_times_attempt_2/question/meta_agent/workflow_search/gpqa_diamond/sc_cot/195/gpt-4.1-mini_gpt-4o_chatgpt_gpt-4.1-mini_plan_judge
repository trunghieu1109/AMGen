proposed answer: In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. The maximum kinetic energy occurs at maximum displacement, where the potential energy is maximum and the kinetic energy is zero. At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. The total energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E = γmc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2). For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is U = (1/2)kA^2 at maximum amplitude. The total energy E is constant and equal to the rest energy plus the maximum potential energy: E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, E = γmc^2, so we set γmc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. Solving for γ gives γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Since γ = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2), we have 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v^2/c^2 gives v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2. Therefore, v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2).
