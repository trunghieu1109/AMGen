Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The Michael addition involves the nucleophilic addition to the β-position of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. For reaction A, dimethyl malonate (a nucleophile) adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester), producing a trimethyl tricarboxylate derivative. The correct structure corresponds to trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, as the addition occurs at the β-position (the 3-position). For reaction B, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as a nucleophile adding to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by hydrolysis to give a hydroxy-substituted product, specifically 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. For reaction C, the starting material C reacts with but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions to yield 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The starting compound C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (a known active methylene compound) that undergoes Michael addition. Comparing all choices, choice3 matches all these assignments exactly.
