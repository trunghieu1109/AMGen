    <pre>The reactions described involve the epoxidation of alkenes followed by hydrolysis to form diols. Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene. When (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, an epoxide is formed that, upon hydrolysis, results in a diol. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene will also form an epoxide and then a diol upon hydrolysis. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the diol formed. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the resulting diol is a meso compound (since the reaction is stereospecific and syn addition results in a meso diol). For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the resulting diol is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. On a standard HPLC column, which is achiral, the meso compound and the racemic mixture will appear as two distinct peaks because they have different physical properties. On a chiral HPLC column, the racemic mixture will resolve into two separate peaks for the two enantiomers, while the meso compound will still appear as a single peak. Therefore, on a standard HPLC, there will be 2 peaks, and on a chiral HPLC, there will be 3 peaks (1 for the meso compound and 2 for the enantiomers).
