Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content='The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will give one pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture) because the epoxidation is stereospecific and produces a trans-epoxide, and the (Z)-alkene will give a different pair of enantiomers (another racemic mixture) producing a cis-epoxide. So, the product mixture contains two pairs of enantiomers (four stereoisomers total). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers are not resolved, so each pair of enantiomers appears as one peak, resulting in 2 peaks total. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each enantiomer appears as a separate peak, resulting in 4 peaks total. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
