Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The epoxidation + acid‚Äêcatalyzed opening is an anti dihydroxylation. Anti addition to the E (trans) alkene gives the meso diol; anti addition to the Z (cis) alkene gives the racemic diol (an R,R/S,S pair). Thus the product mixture contains one meso diastereomer plus two enantiomers. On an achiral column the two enantiomers coelute but the meso diastereomer is separate, giving two peaks. On a chiral column all three stereoisomers resolve, giving three peaks.
