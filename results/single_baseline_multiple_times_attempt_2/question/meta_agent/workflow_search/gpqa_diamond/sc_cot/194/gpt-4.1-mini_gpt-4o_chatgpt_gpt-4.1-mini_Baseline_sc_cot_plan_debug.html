    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The transit impact parameter of 0.2 indicates how far off-center the planet&#39;s transit is. For a transit to occur, the transit impact parameter must be less than 1. The first planet has an orbital period of 3 days and transits with an impact parameter of 0.2. The second planet is larger, with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, but it must remain within the same orbital plane to transit. The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis by Kepler&#39;s third law. Since the second planet must also exhibit occultations, its orbit must be small enough to pass behind the star from our point of view. The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis where these conditions are satisfied. Given the choices, and considering the conditions for both transit and occultation, the maximum period is likely to be the smallest option that is larger than the first planet&#39;s period but still allows for transit and occultation, which is ~7.5 days.
