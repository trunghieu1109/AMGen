Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need the maximum semimajor axis for which both transit and occultation occur: the same inclination as planet 1 yields cos i=b1/(a1/R⋆). From P1=3 d around R⋆=1.5 R⊙ (assume M⋆≈M⊙), we find a1≈27 R⊙ so a1/R⋆≈18, giving cos i≈0.2/18≈0.0111. For planet 2 (Rp2=2.5 R⊕), k2=Rp2/R⋆≈(2.5×0.00915)/1.5≈0.0153, so max a2/R⋆=(1+k2)/cos i≈1.0153/0.0111≈91.5, i.e. a2≈91.5×1.5 R⊙≈137 R⊙. Then P2=P1*(a2/a1)^(3/2)=3 d*(137/27)^(3/2)≈3*11.46≈34.4 d, near 33.5 d.
