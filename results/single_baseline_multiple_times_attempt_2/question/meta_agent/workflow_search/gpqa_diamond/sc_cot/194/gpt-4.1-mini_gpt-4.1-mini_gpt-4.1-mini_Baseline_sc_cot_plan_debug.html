    <pre>The problem involves two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, an orbital period of 3 days, and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star&#39;s radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and we want to find the maximum orbital period for it to exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Key points:
- Transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our viewpoint.
- Occultation (secondary eclipse) occurs when the planet passes behind the star.
- For both transit and occultation to be observed, the orbital inclination must be such that the planet crosses the star&#39;s disk both in front and behind.

Given the impact parameter b = (a / R_star) * cos(i), where a is the orbital radius and i is the inclination.

For the first planet, b = 0.2, R_star = 1.5 R_sun, and period P1 = 3 days.

We can find the inclination i from the first planet&#39;s parameters:

b = (a1 / R_star) * cos(i) = 0.2

Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination i is the same for both.

The maximum impact parameter for transit is b_max = 1 + (R_planet / R_star). For occultation, the maximum impact parameter is b_max_occultation = 1 - (R_planet / R_star).

For the second planet to have both transit and occultation, its impact parameter must satisfy b &lt; 1 - (R_planet2 / R_star).

Calculate R_planet2 / R_star:
- R_planet2 = 2.5 R_earth
- R_star = 1.5 R_sun
- Ratio = (2.5 R_earth) / (1.5 R_sun) = 2.5 / 1.5 * (R_earth / R_sun) = (5/3) * (1/109) ≈ 0.0153

So b &lt; 1 - 0.0153 = 0.9847 for both transit and occultation.

Since b = (a / R_star) * cos(i) and cos(i) = b1 * (R_star / a1) = 0.2 * (R_star / a1),

We can express b2 = (a2 / R_star) * cos(i) = (a2 / R_star) * 0.2 * (R_star / a1) = 0.2 * (a2 / a1).

For b2 &lt; 0.9847, we have:
0.2 * (a2 / a1) &lt; 0.9847 =&gt; (a2 / a1) &lt; 4.9235

Since orbital period P is related to semi-major axis a by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 ∝ a^3

Therefore, (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3

Given (a2 / a1) &lt; 4.9235,

(P2 / 3)^2 &lt; (4.9235)^3

Calculate (4.9235)^3 ≈ 119.4

So (P2 / 3)^2 &lt; 119.4 =&gt; P2 / 3 &lt; sqrt(119.4) ≈ 10.93

Therefore, P2 &lt; 3 * 10.93 ≈ 32.8 days

Among the choices, the closest maximum orbital period is ~33.5 days.

Hence, the answer is choice2: ~33.5 days.
