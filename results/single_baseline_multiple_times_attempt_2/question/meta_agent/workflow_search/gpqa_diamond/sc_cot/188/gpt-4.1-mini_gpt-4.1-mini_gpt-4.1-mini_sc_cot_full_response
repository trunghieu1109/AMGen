Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent D6YW', content='Spontaneously-broken symmetries in physics often lead to the emergence of Goldstone bosons or collective excitations. Magnons are quanta of spin waves in magnetic materials and arise due to spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions can be understood as pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in a field theory and are not themselves Goldstone bosons or excitations directly resulting from a spontaneously broken symmetry. They are stable configurations due to topological reasons rather than symmetry breaking.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
