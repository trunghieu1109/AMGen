Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Magnons are Goldstone modes from broken spin-rotation symmetry; pions are (pseudo)-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking; phonons are Goldstone modes from broken translational symmetry in crystals; skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes from a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
