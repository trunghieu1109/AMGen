Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6iCN', content='The molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with an M+2 at m/z 158 (~32%) indicates one chlorine atom. The broad IR peak from 3500–2700 cm^-1 and sharp strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (O–H stretch and C=O stretch). The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (acid OH) and two doublets integrating to 2H each at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all data.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
