Question: {'question': 'In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', 'choice1': 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', 'choice2': 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', 'choice3': 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', 'choice4': 'change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content="We have a transcription factor that requires dimerization to function. Mutation Y is a heterozygous, dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation means that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In this case, the mutant protein likely forms nonfunctional dimers with the wild-type protein, preventing proper function. This would lead to a loss-of-function phenotype, not a gain-of-function phenotype. Protein aggregation could occur if the mutant protein misfolds, but the key aspect of a dominant-negative effect is the interference with the wild-type protein's function. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nAnswer:B)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
