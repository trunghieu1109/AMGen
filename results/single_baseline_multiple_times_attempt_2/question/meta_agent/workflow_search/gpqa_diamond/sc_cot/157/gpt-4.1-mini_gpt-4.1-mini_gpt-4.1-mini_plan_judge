Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor that functions as a dimer. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is recessive loss-of-function, meaning one wild-type copy is enough for normal function. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is dominant-negative, meaning the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Dominant-negative mutations often occur in proteins that function as multimers, where the mutant subunit disrupts the complex. Here, mutation Y in the dimerization domain likely prevents proper dimerization or causes formation of nonfunctional dimers, inhibiting the function of the wild-type protein. This would lead to loss of protein dimerization and a loss-of-function phenotype, not a wild-type phenotype. Protein aggregation or degradation is less directly implied by the dominant-negative effect in the dimerization domain. A gain-of-function phenotype is unlikely because the mutation is described as dominant-negative (loss-of-function interference). Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is loss of protein dimerization and a loss-of-function phenotype, which corresponds most closely to choice 1, except that choice 1 says 'wild-type phenotype', which contradicts the dominant-negative effect. Choice 2 says 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', which is plausible but less specific. Choice 3 says 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', which could happen but is less typical for dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains. Choice 4 says 'change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', which is unlikely. Since none of the choices perfectly matches the expected dominant-negative effect (loss of dimerization and loss-of-function phenotype), the closest is choice 2, which includes loss-of-function phenotype and protein aggregation, a possible consequence of misfolded mutant protein interfering with wild-type function. Therefore, choice 2 is the best answer.
