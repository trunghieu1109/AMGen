Question: Example(question='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n', choice1='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.', choice2='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.', choice3='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.', choice4='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a trap-free, single-carrier device. It assumes that the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion, and that the injection barrier is negligible, which means the contact must be Ohmic to allow efficient carrier injection. Hence, the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Among the options, choice1 states 'no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current' which aligns well with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Choice2 mentions negligible drift current, which contradicts the premise since the current is drift-dominated. Choice3 mentions two-carrier device which is not the case. Choice4 mentions Schottky contact, which implies a barrier and is not valid for the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, choice1 is correct.
