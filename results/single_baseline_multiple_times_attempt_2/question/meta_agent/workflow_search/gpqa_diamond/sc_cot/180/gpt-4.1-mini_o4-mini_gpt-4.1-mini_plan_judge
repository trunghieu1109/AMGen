Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need neutrino fluxes in two energy bands after stopping the pp-III branch. Band 2 (0.8–0.9 MeV) is dominated by the 0.862 MeV ^7Be line (~4.4×10^9 cm^–2 s^–1). Band 1 (0.7–0.8 MeV) has no pp neutrinos (max 0.42 MeV) and negligible pep, so only CNO continuum (~3.6×10^7 cm^–2 s^–1). B^8 neutrinos contribute ≪10^7. Thus flux ratio ≃3.6×10^7/4.4×10^9≈8×10^–3≈10^–2.
