Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Cc5z', content='We need neutrino fluxes in two energy bands after stopping the pp-III branch. Band\u20092 (0.8–0.9\u2009MeV) is dominated by the 0.862\u2009MeV ^7Be line (~4.4×10^9\u2009cm^–2\u2009s^–1). Band\u20091 (0.7–0.8\u2009MeV) has no pp neutrinos (max 0.42\u2009MeV) and negligible pep, so only CNO continuum (~3.6×10^7\u2009cm^–2\u2009s^–1). B^8 neutrinos contribute ≪10^7. Thus flux ratio ≃3.6×10^7/4.4×10^9≈8×10^–3≈10^–2.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
