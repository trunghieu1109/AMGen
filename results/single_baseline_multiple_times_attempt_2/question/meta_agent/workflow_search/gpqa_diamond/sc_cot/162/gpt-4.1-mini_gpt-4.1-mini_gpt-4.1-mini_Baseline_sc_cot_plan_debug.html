    <pre>First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with H+ ions from the strong acid. The dissolution reaction can be considered as Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -&gt; Fe3+ + 3H2O. So, 3 moles of H+ are needed to dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)3. Moles of H+ needed = 3 * 9.36 x 10^-4 mol = 2.808 x 10^-3 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so volume of acid needed = moles / concentration = 2.808 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, so after adding acid, the pH is determined by the excess H+ ions. Since all H+ are consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)3, the pH will be determined by the concentration of Fe3+ ions and hydrolysis. However, since the acid is strong and monobasic, and the volume of acid added is about 28 cm3, the pH will be low. Among the given choices, the one with volume near 28 cm3 and pH about 2.04 matches the calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A).
