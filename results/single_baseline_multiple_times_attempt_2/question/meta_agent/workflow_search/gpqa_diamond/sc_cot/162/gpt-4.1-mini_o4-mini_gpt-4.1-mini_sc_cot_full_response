Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃: M=106.87 g/mol, n=0.1/106.87≈9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. Reaction Fe(OH)₃+3H⁺→Fe³⁺+3H₂O needs n_H⁺=3n≈2.81×10⁻³ mol. At 0.1 M acid, V=n/C≈0.00281/0.1=0.0281 L=28.05 cm³. That is the minimum volume to dissolve the oxide. After dissolution, only Fe³⁺ remains, which hydrolyzes to give pH around 2 (using Ka₁≈10⁻²). Thus choice A matches both volume and pH.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
