Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃: M=106.87 g/mol, n=0.1/106.87≈9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. Reaction Fe(OH)₃+3H⁺→Fe³⁺+3H₂O needs n_H⁺=3n≈2.81×10⁻³ mol. At 0.1 M acid, V=n/C≈0.00281/0.1=0.0281 L=28.05 cm³. That is the minimum volume to dissolve the oxide. After dissolution, only Fe³⁺ remains, which hydrolyzes to give pH around 2 (using Ka₁≈10⁻²). Thus choice A matches both volume and pH.
