    <pre>The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged and conductive, the charge +q inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the cavity and the outer surface of the conductor such that the electric field inside the conductor&#39;s material is zero. For points outside the spherical conductor (distance L &gt; R), the conductor and the cavity with charge inside behave like a neutral conductor with a net charge of zero. The conductor shields the inside charge from outside influence, so the net effect is that the outside sees no net charge. Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is zero. However, since the problem only provides options with expressions for E, the correct approach is to consider the conductor as a perfect shield, and the charge +q inside the cavity does not affect the outside field. Hence, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is zero. But since zero is not given as an option, the next best is to consider the conductor plus cavity as a single neutral conductor with no net charge, so the field outside is zero. Therefore, none of the options is strictly correct, but if we consider the conductor as a point charge +q at the center of the cavity, then the field at P would be E = (1/4πε₀) q / l², where l is the distance from the cavity center to point P. So the best matching choice is choice3: E = (1/4πε₀) q / l².
