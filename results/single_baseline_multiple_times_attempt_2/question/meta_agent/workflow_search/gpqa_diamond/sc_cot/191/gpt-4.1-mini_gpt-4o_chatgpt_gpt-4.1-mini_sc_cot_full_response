Question: {'question': 'Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Iw6I', content="When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor. For a point P outside the conductor, the charge distribution on the conductor can be treated as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor, due to the spherical symmetry of the problem. Hence, the electric field at point P is due to the charge +q located at the center of the conductor, at a distance L from P. The electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge located at the center of the conductor, which is E = (1/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_o)) (q/L^2).\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
