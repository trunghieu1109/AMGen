Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, we need to express this in terms of distance r. Since parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r (plx = 1/r), we substitute plx = 1/r into the expression. This gives the number of stars proportional to 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.
