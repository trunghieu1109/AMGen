Question: {'question': 'In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QNME', content='Number per unit parallax dN/dp ∝ 1/p^5. With p ∝ 1/r, p = 1/r ⇒ 1/p^5 = r^5. Also dp/dr = -1/r^2 so dN/dr = (dN/dp)(dp/dr) ∝ r^5 × (1/r^2) = r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
