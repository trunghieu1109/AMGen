Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Number per unit parallax dN/dp ∝ 1/p^5. With p ∝ 1/r, p = 1/r ⇒ 1/p^5 = r^5. Also dp/dr = -1/r^2 so dN/dr = (dN/dp)(dp/dr) ∝ r^5 × (1/r^2) = r^3.
