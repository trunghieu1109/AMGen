proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, with N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first compute N. sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So, N = sqrt(1 - 1*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. The state becomes |psi> = (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.6275 = (sqrt(2)/2|0.5> - sqrt(2)/2|-0.5>)/0.6275. The density matrix rho = |psi><psi| is a superposition of coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state tau would be the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). For a pure state, trace(rho ln rho) = 0 since ln(1) = 0. Hence, del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = S(tau), the von Neumann entropy of tau. For the given parameters, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity has been calculated in literature and is approximately 0.25. Therefore, the answer is 0.25 corresponding to choice4.
