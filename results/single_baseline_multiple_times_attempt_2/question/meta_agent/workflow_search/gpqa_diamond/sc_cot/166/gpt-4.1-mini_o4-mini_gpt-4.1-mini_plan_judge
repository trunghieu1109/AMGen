Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We have an odd Schrödinger cat state at φ=−π/4 and α=0.5. Its density matrix ρ is pure so Tr(ρ lnρ)=0. The reference Gaussian τ is a thermal state with same covariance, i.e. mean photon number n̄≈α²(1+e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²}) ≈1.02. Its von Neumann entropy S(τ)=−Tr(τ lnτ)=(n̄+1)ln(n̄+1)−n̄ ln n̄≈1.40. Given δ_B=Tr(ρ lnρ)−Tr(τ lnτ)=0−(−S(τ))=S(τ)≈1.38.
