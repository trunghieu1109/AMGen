Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The observed peak wavelength is 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared range. The flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, indicating that the intrinsic emission peak is at a shorter wavelength but has been redshifted to 790 nm due to the expansion of the universe. Assuming the intrinsic peak is around the Lyman-alpha line at 121.6 nm (typical for quasars), the redshift z can be calculated using the formula: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). Thus, z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5. Using the Lambda-CDM model with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and a flat universe, a quasar at z ≈ 5.5 has a comoving distance roughly around 8 to 9 Gpc. Among the choices, 8 Gpc and 9 Gpc are plausible, but 8 Gpc is a commonly accepted approximate value for such a redshift.
