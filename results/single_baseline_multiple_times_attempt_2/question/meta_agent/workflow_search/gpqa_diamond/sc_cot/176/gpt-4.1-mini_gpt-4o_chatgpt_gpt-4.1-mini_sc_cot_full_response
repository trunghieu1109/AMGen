Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Dt0q', content="To find the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien's Displacement Law). Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. The luminosity ratio is then (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.25.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
