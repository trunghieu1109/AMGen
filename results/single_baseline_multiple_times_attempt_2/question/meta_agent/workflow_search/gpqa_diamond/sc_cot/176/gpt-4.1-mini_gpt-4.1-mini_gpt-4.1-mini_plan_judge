Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The stars have the same peak wavelength, which means they have the same temperature (Wien's Law: peak wavelength inversely proportional to temperature). Luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since temperatures are the same, the luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio. Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so luminosity ratio = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass and radial velocities are not relevant to luminosity calculation here.
