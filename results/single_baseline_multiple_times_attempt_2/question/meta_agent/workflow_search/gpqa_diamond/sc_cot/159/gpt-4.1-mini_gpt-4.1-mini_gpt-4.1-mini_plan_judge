Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern. The first minimum of the Airy pattern occurs at an angle theta where 1.22 * lambda / D = theta, with D being the diameter of the aperture. Here, the apothem a corresponds to the radius, so diameter D = 2a. The first minimum is at theta_1 = 1.22 * lambda / (2a) = 0.61 * lambda / a. The second minimum occurs at approximately twice the angle of the first minimum, so the angular distance between the first two minima is about 0.61 * lambda / a. Therefore, the answer is choice B) 0.610 \lambda / a.
