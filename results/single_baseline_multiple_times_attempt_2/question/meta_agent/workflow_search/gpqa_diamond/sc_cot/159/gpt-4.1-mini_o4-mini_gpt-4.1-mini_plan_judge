Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the limit N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. The first zero occurs at θ1≈1.22λ/D where D=2a, so θ1≈1.22λ/(2a)=0.61λ/a. The second zero occurs at the second root of J1, giving θ2≈7.016λ/(πD)=1.116λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima is θ2−θ1≈(1.116−0.610)λ/a≈0.506λ/a.
