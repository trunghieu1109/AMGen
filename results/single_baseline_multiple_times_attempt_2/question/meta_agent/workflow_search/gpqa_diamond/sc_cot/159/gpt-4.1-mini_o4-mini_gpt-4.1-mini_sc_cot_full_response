Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sUdM', content='In the limit N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. The first zero occurs at θ1≈1.22λ/D where D=2a, so θ1≈1.22λ/(2a)=0.61λ/a. The second zero occurs at the second root of J1, giving θ2≈7.016λ/(πD)=1.116λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima is θ2−θ1≈(1.116−0.610)λ/a≈0.506λ/a.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
