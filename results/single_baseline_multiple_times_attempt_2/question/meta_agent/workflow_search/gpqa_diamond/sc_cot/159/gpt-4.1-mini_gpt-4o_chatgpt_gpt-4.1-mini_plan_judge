Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The apothem a becomes the radius of this circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk pattern. The first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture occurs at an angle where the Bessel function J1(x) first becomes zero. The angular radius of the first minimum for a circular aperture is given by 1.22 \lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the diameter D is 2a (as the apothem is the radius), the angular distance between the first two minima is given by 1.22 \lambda / a.
