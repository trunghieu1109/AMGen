Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We estimate ESPRESSO on an 8m telescope reaches S/N~10 in 1h up to V~16. Apparent magnitudes: Canopus V~-0.7 (detectable), Polaris V~2.0 (detectable), M_V=15 at 10pc gives V=15 (detectable), at 5pc gives V~13.5 (detectable), at 50pc gives V~18.5 (too faint), at 200pc gives V~21.5 (too faint). Thatâ€™s 4 stars detectable.
