proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star as it would be observed from Earth. The ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT can detect stars with a certain signal-to-noise ratio if their apparent magnitude is within its sensitivity range. 

Let's calculate the apparent magnitude for each star:

1. Canopus is a bright star with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74. This is easily detectable.
2. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98. This is also easily detectable.
3. For the star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is 15 mag (since it's at 10 pc, the distance modulus is 0).
4. For the star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 200 pc, the apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 = 20.51 mag.
5. For the star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 5 pc, the apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 13.49 mag.
6. For the star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 50 pc, the apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 = 19.49 mag.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is capable of detecting stars with apparent magnitudes up to about 16-17 mag with a good signal-to-noise ratio in a 1-hour exposure.

Therefore, the detectable stars are:
- Canopus (apparent magnitude -0.74)
- Polaris (apparent magnitude 1.98)
- Star at 10 pc (apparent magnitude 15)
- Star at 5 pc (apparent magnitude 13.49)

The stars at 200 pc (apparent magnitude 20.51) and 50 pc (apparent magnitude 19.49) are likely too faint to be detected with a good S/N in a 1-hour exposure.

Thus, there are 4 detectable stars.
