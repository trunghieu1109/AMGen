proposed answer: To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable with ESPRESSO on an 8m VLT telescope, we need to consider the brightness of each star in terms of apparent magnitude and the capability of ESPRESSO to achieve S/N >= 10 in 1 hour exposure. The key is to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star and compare it to the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO. The ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m telescope can typically achieve S/N=10 for stars around V~16 magnitude in 1 hour exposure. 

Let's analyze each star:
- Canopus: Very bright star (V ~ -0.7), easily detectable.
- Polaris: Bright star (V ~ 2), easily detectable.

For stars c) to f), all have Absolute V magnitude = 15 mag.
Apparent magnitude m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5, where d is distance in parsecs.

c) d = 10 pc
m = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*1 - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15

d) d = 200 pc
m = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 = 15 + 5*(2.3010) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505

e) d = 5 pc
m = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 15 + 5*0.6990 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495

f) d = 50 pc
m = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 = 15 + 5*1.6990 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495

Now, comparing apparent magnitudes to ESPRESSO's detection limit (V ~ 16):
- c) 15 mag: detectable
- d) 21.5 mag: not detectable
- e) 13.5 mag: detectable
- f) 18.5 mag: not detectable

So, detectable stars are: Canopus, Polaris, c), e) = 4 stars.

Therefore, the answer is 4.
