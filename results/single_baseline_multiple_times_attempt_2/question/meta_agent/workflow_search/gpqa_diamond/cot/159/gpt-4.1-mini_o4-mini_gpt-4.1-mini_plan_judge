Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: As N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with minima given by zeros of J1. The first minimum is at 2πaθ1/λ=3.8317 ⇒ θ1=0.610λ/a; the second at 2πaθ2/λ=7.0156 ⇒ θ2=1.116λ/a. The angular separation between these two minima is θ2−θ1=(7.0156−3.8317)/(2π)λ/a≈0.506λ/a.
