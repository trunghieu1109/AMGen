Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR data indicates the presence of an OH group (broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1) and a carbonyl group (sharp peak at 1720 cm-1), suggesting a carboxylic acid. The NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, typical for a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic protons appear at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm as doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The remaining signals correspond to aliphatic protons. Compound X is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts the carboxylic acid to an alkyl iodide, removing the carboxyl group. Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
