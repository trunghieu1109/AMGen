Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR data shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 indicating a carboxylic acid O-H stretch, and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 indicating a C=O stretch typical of carboxylic acids. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks suggest aromatic C=C stretches. The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (carboxylic acid proton), two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (aromatic protons, likely para-substituted benzene), and aliphatic multiplets and doublet/triplet indicating a sec-butyl group. Reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically reduces carboxylic acids to alkyl groups. However, since the product is to be identified before reduction, the presence of the acid proton at 10.5 ppm and the IR carboxylic acid stretches confirm the compound is a benzoic acid derivative with a sec-butyl substituent. Among the choices, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid fits the data best as it has the carboxylic acid group and the sec-butyl group para to each other. The other options are either alkylarenes without acid groups or have different substituents. Therefore, the final product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.
