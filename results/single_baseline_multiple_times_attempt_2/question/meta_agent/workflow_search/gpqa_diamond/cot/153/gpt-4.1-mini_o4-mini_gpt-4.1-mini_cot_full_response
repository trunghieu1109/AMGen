Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eeAI', content='We observe a molecular ion at m/z 156 with a 158 peak at ~32% intensity, suggesting one Cl (35/37 isotopes). IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O, indicating a carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR has a 11.0 ppm singlet (1H, COOH) and two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene. Thus the structure is para-chlorobenzoic acid (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
