    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$.

What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R.

    <pre>The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The conductor will rearrange its free charges on the outer surface such that the electric field inside the conductor&#39;s conducting material is zero. The cavity and the charge inside it do not affect the external field as if the conductor were a solid conductor with no cavity and no internal charge. The conductor shields the outside from the internal charge. Therefore, the net charge on the conductor (which is zero) determines the field outside. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total external field due to the conductor plus the charge inside the cavity is zero. Hence, outside the conductor, the electric field is zero, or equivalently, the conductor behaves as if no internal charge exists. But the problem states the conductor is uncharged, and the charge is inside a cavity. The conductor&#39;s induced charges will cancel the field outside. So the net field at point P outside is zero. However, the problem asks for the magnitude of the electric field at point P due to the charge +q inside the cavity. Since the conductor shields the external region from any internal charges, the field outside is zero. But the options given suggest that the field is due to charge q at some effective position. The correct approach is to consider that the conductor shields the field, so the external field is as if the charge +q is not present. So the field at P is zero. None of the options say zero. Alternatively, if the conductor were absent, the field at P due to charge q at a distance l would be E = (1/4πε₀) * q / l², which is choice3. But the conductor is present, so the field outside is zero. Since the problem does not mention induced charges explicitly, and the options suggest a formula depending on l, s, and θ, the best approximation is that the field at P is as if the charge q is at the cavity center, so E = (1/4πε₀) * q / l², which is choice3. So the answer is C).
