Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Genomics data analysis errors can arise from multiple subtle mismatches. Mutually incompatible data formats often trigger immediate obvious failures, whereas the following issues are more insidious:

1. “chr”/“no chr” confusion: Mismatch in naming conventions can lead to silent omissions or misalignments of chromosome data.
2. Reference assembly mismatch: Using different genome builds (e.g., hg19 vs hg38) without proper liftover can misplace coordinates.
3. Incorrect ID conversion: Gene or variant ID mappings (e.g., Ensembl vs RefSeq) can be outdated or ambiguous, causing silent misannotations.

These three (2, 3, and 4) are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors because they don’t always cause outright crashes but instead lead to subtle, incorrect results. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
