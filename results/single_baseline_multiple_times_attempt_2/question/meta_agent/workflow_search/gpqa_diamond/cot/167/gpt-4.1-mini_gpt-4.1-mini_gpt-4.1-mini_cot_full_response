Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content="The question asks about the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The issues listed are: Mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, Reference assembly mismatch, and Incorrect ID conversion. All these issues can cause problems, but mutually incompatible data formats are often caught early because data won't load properly. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are more subtle and can lead to erroneous results that are hard to detect. Therefore, the most common difficult-to-spot issues are 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
