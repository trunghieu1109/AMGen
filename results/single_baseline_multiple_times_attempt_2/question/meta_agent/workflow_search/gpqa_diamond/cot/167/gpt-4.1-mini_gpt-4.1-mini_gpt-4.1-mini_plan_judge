Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question asks about the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The issues listed are: Mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, Reference assembly mismatch, and Incorrect ID conversion. All these issues can cause problems, but mutually incompatible data formats are often caught early because data won't load properly. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are more subtle and can lead to erroneous results that are hard to detect. Therefore, the most common difficult-to-spot issues are 2, 3, and 4.
