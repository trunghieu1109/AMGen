Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is no longer zero (div B = μ0ρm) and Faraday’s law (curl E = -∂B/∂t) picks up a magnetic current term (curl E = -∂B/∂t - Jm). Thus the changed equations are the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.
