Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eeAI', content='In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is no longer zero (div B = μ0ρm) and Faraday’s law (curl E = -∂B/∂t) picks up a magnetic current term (curl E = -∂B/∂t - Jm). Thus the changed equations are the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
