proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of the stars as seen from Earth, since the detectability is based on the signal-to-noise ratio achieved in an observation. 

1. Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of around -0.74, so it is definitely detectable.
2. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98, so it is also detectable.
3. The star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag located at 10 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15, since at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude equals the absolute magnitude. This is likely detectable as ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent magnitudes up to about 16-17.
4. The star located at 200 pc with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag would have an apparent magnitude of 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 20. This is too faint for ESPRESSO to detect.
5. The star located at 5 pc with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag would have an apparent magnitude of 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 14.5. This is detectable.
6. The star located at 50 pc with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag would have an apparent magnitude of 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 19. This is too faint.

Thus, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc, totaling 4 stars.
