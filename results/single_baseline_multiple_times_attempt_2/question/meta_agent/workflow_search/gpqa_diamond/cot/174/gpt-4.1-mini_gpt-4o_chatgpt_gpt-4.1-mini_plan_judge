Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroidal, which means it has axial symmetry. When such a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated per unit solid angle typically depends on the angle \( \theta \) with respect to the axis of symmetry (the z-axis) and the wavelength \( \lambda \) of the radiation. For a dipole-like radiation pattern, the power is often proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \). The maximum power is radiated at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), and the fraction of this power radiated at any other angle \( \theta \) can be found using the ratio of \( \sin^2(\theta) \) at that angle to \( \sin^2(90^\circ) \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 1/2 \), so \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is 1/4. Now, considering the possible forms of the function \( f \), the radiation from a dipole is typically proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \) (Rayleigh scattering), which matches with the choice that has 1/4 as the fraction. Therefore, the answer is 1/4, \( \lambda^{-4} \).
