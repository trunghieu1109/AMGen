Question: {'question': 'Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', 'choice1': '1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice2': '3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', 'choice3': '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice4': '1/4, \\lambda^(-3)'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zWWs', content='An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution changing its shape has no net dipole moment, so the leading radiation is quadrupole. Electric quadrupole radiation intensity scales as ω^6 ∝ λ^(−6), and the angular distribution for a Qzz quadrupole is ∝sin^2θ\u2009cos^2θ, maximized at θ=45° (sin^2\u200945°\u2009cos^2\u200945°=1/4). At θ=30°, sin^2\u200930°\u2009cos^2\u200930°=(1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, so the fraction of the peak is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4. Hence the fraction is 3/4 and f∝λ^(−6). This corresponds to choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
