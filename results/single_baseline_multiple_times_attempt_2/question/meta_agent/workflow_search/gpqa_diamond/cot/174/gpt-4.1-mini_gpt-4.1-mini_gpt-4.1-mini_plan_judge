Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: For an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry axis along z-axis, the radiation pattern depends on the angular distribution of the dipole radiation. The power radiated per unit solid angle typically follows a sin^2(theta) dependence for dipole radiation, where theta is the angle from the axis of oscillation (z-axis). The maximum power A will be at theta = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the z-axis), where sin^2(90°) = 1. At theta = 30 degrees, the power fraction will be sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, the radiated power from an oscillating charge typically scales as lambda^(-4) because power radiated by an accelerating charge is proportional to the fourth power of frequency (f^4), and frequency f is inversely proportional to wavelength lambda, so power scales as lambda^(-4). Thus, the fraction of A at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to lambda^(-4). This matches choice3.
