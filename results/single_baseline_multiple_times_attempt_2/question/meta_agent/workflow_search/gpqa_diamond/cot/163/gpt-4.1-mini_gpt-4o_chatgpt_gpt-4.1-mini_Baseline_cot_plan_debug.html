    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.7&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.2&#39;}

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to use Kepler&#39;s third law and the properties of binary star systems. For a binary system, the total mass M of the system is related to the period P and the semi-major axis a by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 = (4Ï€^2 / G(M1 + M2)) * a^3, where G is the gravitational constant. The radial velocity amplitudes (RV) can help determine the semi-major axes of the stars&#39; orbits. For system_1, we have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and a period of 2 years. For system_2, we have RV amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s, and a period of 1 year. The ratio of the total masses can be approximated by considering the ratio of the products of the periods squared and the RV amplitudes (since a is proportional to the RV amplitude and P). For system_1, the product is (2^2) * (10+5) = 60, and for system_2, the product is (1^2) * (15+10) = 25. The ratio of the masses is approximately 60/25 = 2.4. Thus, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
