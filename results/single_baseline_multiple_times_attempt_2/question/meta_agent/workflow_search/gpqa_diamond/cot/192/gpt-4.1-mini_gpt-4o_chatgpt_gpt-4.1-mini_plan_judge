Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), so plx ~ 1/r. If the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, then it varies as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r^5.
