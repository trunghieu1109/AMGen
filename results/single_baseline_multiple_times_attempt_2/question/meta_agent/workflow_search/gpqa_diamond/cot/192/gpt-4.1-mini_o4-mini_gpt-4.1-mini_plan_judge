Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We know plx ∝ 1/r so plx = 1/r. Given dN/dplx ∝ 1/plx^5. The number per unit r is dN/dr = (dN/dplx)*(dplx/dr). Since dplx/dr = 1/r^2 and 1/plx^5 = r^5, we get dN/dr ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3.
