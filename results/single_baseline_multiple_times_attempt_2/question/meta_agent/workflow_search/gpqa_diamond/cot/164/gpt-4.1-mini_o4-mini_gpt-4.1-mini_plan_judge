Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need to identify which statement correctly describes using only ethylene with a dual catalyst to introduce regular branches. Statement 1 is false—such systems aren’t implemented industrially at scale. Statement 3 is wrong—group VIa (Cr, Mo, W) catalysts aren’t used for branching in polyethylene. Statement 4 is incorrect—noble metal catalysts (Pd, Pt) aren’t used industrially for this purpose due to cost and practicality, but they’re not a viable option for branching ethylene-only polymerization. Statement 2 is correct—aluminum-based activators (e.g., MAO) don’t work for the essential telomerization step needed to introduce regular branches with ethylene-only systems, which typically require other activators for Pd-catalyzed oligomerization.
