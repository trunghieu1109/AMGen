Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sUdM', content='We model 12 charges of 2e on a sphere radius R=2 m with one charge at center. Energy E=∑_{i<j}kq_iq_j/r_ij. Center–sphere pairs: 12·k(2e)^2/R. Sphere–sphere: minimal Thomson arrangement is icosahedron: 12 points with 30 edges of length d1≈2.1029 m, 30 next-nearest d2≈3.4026 m, 6 antipodal d3=4 m. Sum 1/d over 66 pairs≈24.567. With k(2e)^2≈9.243×10^−28 J·m: E_ss≈2.27×10^−26 J. Center–sphere E_cs≈5.55×10^−27 J. Total≈2.826×10^−26 J.
