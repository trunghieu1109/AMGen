    <pre>There are 13 identical particles with charge 2e each. One charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are constrained to be 2 m from P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system. The energy comes from electrostatic potential energy between pairs of charges. The charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 m, and the 12 charges also interact among themselves. The 12 charges will arrange themselves on a sphere of radius 2 m to minimize their mutual potential energy. The charge at P will add potential energy terms with each of the 12 charges. The potential energy between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k = 1/(4 * pi * epsilon_0) ≈ 8.988 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2. Each charge is 2e, where e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C. First, calculate the energy between the central charge and the 12 charges: U_center = 12 * k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 = 12 * k * 4e^2 / 2 = 12 * 2 * k * e^2 = 24 * k * e^2. Next, calculate the energy among the 12 charges on the sphere. The minimum energy configuration of 12 identical charges on a sphere is a known problem (Thomson problem). The total potential energy for 12 charges on a sphere can be approximated or taken from literature. For 12 charges on a sphere, the total energy U_12 ≈ 5.103 k q^2 / r (from known results). Here q = 2e, r = 2 m, so U_12 = 5.103 * k * (2e)^2 / 2 = 5.103 * k * 4e^2 / 2 = 5.103 * 2 * k * e^2 = 10.206 * k * e^2. Total energy U_total = U_center + U_12 = (24 + 10.206) * k * e^2 = 34.206 * k * e^2. Now calculate numerical value: k = 8.988 x 10^9, e = 1.602 x 10^-19, so e^2 = (1.602 x 10^-19)^2 = 2.5664 x 10^-38. Then U_total = 34.206 * 8.988 x 10^9 * 2.5664 x 10^-38 = 34.206 * 8.988 * 2.5664 x 10^{-29} ≈ 34.206 * 23.07 x 10^{-29} ≈ 789.3 x 10^{-29} = 7.893 x 10^{-27} J. Comparing with choices, closest is 7.056 x 10^-27 (choice 3). Therefore, answer is C).
