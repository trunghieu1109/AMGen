Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The problem involves the ratio of the populations of iron atoms in a specific energy level in two stars, which can be described by the Boltzmann distribution under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The population ratio n_1/n_2 for the same energy level at temperatures T_1 and T_2 is given by n_1/n_2 = exp[-(E/k)(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)], where E is the energy difference, and k is the Boltzmann constant. Given that n_1 = 2 * n_2, we have 2 = exp[-(E/k)(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)]. Taking natural logarithm on both sides gives ln(2) = -(E/k)(1/T_1 - 1/T_2). Rearranging, ln(2) = (E/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Since E/k is a constant, the form ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1*T_2) matches the correct relationship (assuming the constants are absorbed). Among the given options, choice4: ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)] matches the derived form.
