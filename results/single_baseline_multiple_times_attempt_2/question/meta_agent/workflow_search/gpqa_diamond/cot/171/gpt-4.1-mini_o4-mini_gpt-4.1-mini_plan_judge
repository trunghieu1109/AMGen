Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: For LTE populations, n2/n1 ∝ exp(−E/(kT)). Given (n2/n1)_1/(n2/n1)_2=2: exp[−E/(kT1)+E/(kT2)]=2 ⇒ E/k(1/T2−1/T1)=ln2. Since E/k≈1 K, ln2=(1/T2−1/T1)=(T1−T2)/(T1T2).
