Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, with the assumption that the photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the population of excited states can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the population of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (N_1/N_2) = exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. We know that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so (N_1/N_2)_1 = 2 * (N_1/N_2)_2. This gives us the relation: exp(-ΔE/kT_1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/kT_2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get: -ΔE/kT_1 = ln(2) - ΔE/kT_2. Rearranging gives: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This matches choice 4, where ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) after recognizing the form of the expression.
