Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xKiP', content="The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger. The stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same temperature (from Wien's law, wavelength peak is inversely proportional to temperature). Luminosity L of a star as a black body is given by L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the ratio of luminosities depends only on the square of the radius ratio. The radius ratio is 1.5, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
