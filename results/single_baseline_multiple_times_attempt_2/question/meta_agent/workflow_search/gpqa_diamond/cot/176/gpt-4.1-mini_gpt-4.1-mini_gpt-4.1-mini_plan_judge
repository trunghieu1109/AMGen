Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger. The stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same temperature (from Wien's law, wavelength peak is inversely proportional to temperature). Luminosity L of a star as a black body is given by L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the ratio of luminosities depends only on the square of the radius ratio. The radius ratio is 1.5, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.
