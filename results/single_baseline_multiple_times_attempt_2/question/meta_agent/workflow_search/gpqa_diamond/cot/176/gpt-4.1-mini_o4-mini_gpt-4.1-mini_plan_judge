Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Star_1 and Star_2 have the same observed λ_max so naively T1=T2 and L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2=1.5^2=2.25. But Star_2 is receding at 700 km/s so its emitted peak λ_emit=λ_obs/(1+v/c), making its intrinsic T2=T_obs(1+v/c). Thus T1/T2=1/(1+v/c) and L1/L2=(1.5)^2/(1+v/c)^4≈2.25/(1.002333)^4≈2.23.
