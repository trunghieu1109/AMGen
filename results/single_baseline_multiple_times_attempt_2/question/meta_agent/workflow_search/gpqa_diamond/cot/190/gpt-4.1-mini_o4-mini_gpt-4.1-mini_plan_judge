Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The benzyl ether is installed at C3, the ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone and then reductively eliminated (Shapiro/Wolff–Kishner–type) to CH2, and finally hydrogenation removes the benzyl protecting group and reduces any double bonds (including the isopropenyl substituent to isopropyl). The net result is a cyclohexane with a CH2OH at one carbon and an isopropyl at the carbon two positions away. Naming by priority (alcohol at C1) gives 3-isopropylcyclohexanemethanol, matching choice 1 (A).
