Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the effects of the mutations described. Mutation X is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain. This means that when X is present in a homozygous state, the transcription factor loses its function, but when heterozygous (one wild-type allele and one mutant allele), the function is retained. Mutation Y is a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. A dominant-negative mutation typically results in a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming nonfunctional complexes. In the context of a transcription factor that dimerizes, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain could lead to the formation of nonfunctional dimers or aggregates, thereby inhibiting the function of the wild-type protein. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype, as the mutant protein likely forms aggregates with the wild-type protein, preventing proper dimerization and function.
