Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question describes two mutations: mutation X in the transactivation domain, which is recessive and loss-of-function, and mutation Y in the dimerization domain, which acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming nonfunctional dimers or complexes with the wild-type protein, thereby inhibiting its function. Since mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as dominant-negative, it likely causes defective dimerization, preventing normal dimer formation and resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype despite the presence of a wild-type allele. Therefore, the molecular phenotype most likely observed is loss of protein dimerization and a wild-type phenotype is unlikely, protein aggregation is possible but less likely, protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele is less typical for dominant-negative mutations, and gain-of-function phenotype is inconsistent with dominant-negative action. Thus, the best choice is loss of protein dimerization and loss-of-function phenotype, but since that exact wording is not present, the closest is choice 1 (loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype) or choice 2 (protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype). Because dominant-negative mutations usually cause loss of function, and the question asks for the most likely molecular phenotype, the best fit is choice 1, which mentions loss of dimerization, consistent with mutation in the dimerization domain. However, choice 1 says 'and wild-type phenotype,' which contradicts the dominant-negative effect. Choice 2 mentions protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, which fits dominant-negative mutations causing nonfunctional complexes. Therefore, choice 2 is more accurate for dominant-negative effects causing loss-of-function. Hence, the answer is B).
