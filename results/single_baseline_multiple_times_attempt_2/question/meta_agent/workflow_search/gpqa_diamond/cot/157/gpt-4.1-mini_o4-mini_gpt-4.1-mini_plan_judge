Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a transcription factor that functions as a dimer. A recessive mutation in the transactivation domain just loses function but is recessive. A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain must still allow dimer formation with the wild-type subunit but inactivate the resulting heterodimer, thereby dominating over the wild-type allele. The molecular phenotype is not simple loss of dimerization (that would be recessive) nor degradation of the wild-type, nor a gain-of-function. Rather, the mutant protein “poisons” the wild-type by forming nonfunctional dimers—a form of aggregation—leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in heterozygotes. This corresponds to choice B.
