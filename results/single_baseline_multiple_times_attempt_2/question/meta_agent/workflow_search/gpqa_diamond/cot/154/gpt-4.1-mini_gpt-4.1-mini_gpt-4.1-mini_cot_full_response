Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TiAN', content='The state vector is given as |psi> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2), which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. We want to find the uncertainty ΔP_z in this state. The operator P_z is diagonal in this basis with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors. First, calculate the expectation value <P_z> = <psi|P_z|psi> = sum_i |psi_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Next, calculate <P_z^2> = sum_i |psi_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2 = (1/4)*ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Then, the variance (ΔP_z)^2 = <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2 = (1/2)ħ^2 - 0 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
