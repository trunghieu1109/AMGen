Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the neutrinos (V) can carry away varying amounts of energy, leading to a range of possible energies for the E particles. The endpoint Q represents the maximum possible energy the E particles can have if the neutrinos carry away the least energy. In the variant decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M is emitted instead of 2 neutrinos. Since M is massless, it can carry away varying amounts of energy as well, similar to the neutrinos. However, since there is only one massless particle instead of two, the distribution of energy between the E particles and M will change, but the spectrum will remain continuous. The endpoint energy for the E particles will likely increase because with only one massless particle, there is less energy carried away by the light particles, allowing the E particles to potentially have more energy. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint increases.
