Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the presence of two light particles E and two light particles V means the energy shared among the emitted particles can vary continuously, leading to a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles. The endpoint Q corresponds to the maximum energy that the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy.\n\nIn the variant decay, one exotic massless particle M replaces the two V particles, so the decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless and exotic, it can carry away varying amounts of energy, but now there is only one such particle instead of two.\n\nHaving fewer particles to share the energy with generally means the energy distribution of the E particles changes. The spectrum remains continuous because there are still multiple particles sharing the energy, allowing a range of energy values for E. However, the shape of the spectrum will adjust due to the different kinematics.\n\nRegarding the endpoint, replacing two V particles with one massless M particle means that the total available energy is distributed differently. Since M is massless and can carry away energy, the maximum energy of E particles is expected to increase, as there is less mass-energy carried away by the other particles (two V particles are replaced by one massless M particle).\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
