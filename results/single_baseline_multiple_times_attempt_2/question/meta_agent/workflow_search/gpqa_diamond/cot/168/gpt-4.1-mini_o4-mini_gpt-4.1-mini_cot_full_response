Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='In the original 2νββ decay (2A → 2B + 2e + 2ν), the summed electron energy spectrum is continuous because the two neutrinos can carry off a variable share of the available Q‐value. The endpoint of the summed electron spectrum is at Q minus twice the neutrino masses, which is essentially Q for light neutrinos. In the exotic mode 2A → 2B + 2e + M, there is still a three‐body final state (two electrons plus one massless M), so the electron sum energy is again continuous. Since M is massless, the maximum electron energy occurs when M carries zero energy, giving a summed electron endpoint at the full Q (versus Q – 2mν in the standard decay). Thus the endpoint increases slightly (by the 2mν amount) and the shape is modified for a single massless particle instead of two neutrinos.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
