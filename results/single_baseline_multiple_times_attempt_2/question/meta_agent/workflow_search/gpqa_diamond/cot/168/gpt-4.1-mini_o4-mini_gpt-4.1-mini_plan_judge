Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original 2νββ decay (2A → 2B + 2e + 2ν), the summed electron energy spectrum is continuous because the two neutrinos can carry off a variable share of the available Q‐value. The endpoint of the summed electron spectrum is at Q minus twice the neutrino masses, which is essentially Q for light neutrinos. In the exotic mode 2A → 2B + 2e + M, there is still a three‐body final state (two electrons plus one massless M), so the electron sum energy is again continuous. Since M is massless, the maximum electron energy occurs when M carries zero energy, giving a summed electron endpoint at the full Q (versus Q – 2mν in the standard decay). Thus the endpoint increases slightly (by the 2mν amount) and the shape is modified for a single massless particle instead of two neutrinos.
