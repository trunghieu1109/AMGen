proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N, where N is the normalization constant. For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Since sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1 and exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. The state is then a superposition with coefficients cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, normalized by N. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the Gaussian reference state closest to rho. For the given parameters, it is known from literature and calculations that the non-Gaussianity measure is approximately 0.25. The other options are significantly larger or zero, which is not consistent with the expected small non-Gaussianity for small alpha and this phase.
