Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m = 1 × 10^(-10) m. Electron speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE due to the uncertainty in position Δx. Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π) and h = 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js, so ħ ≈ 1.055 × 10^(-34) Js. Calculate Δp: Δp ≥ ħ / (2 Δx) = (1.055 × 10^(-34)) / (2 × 1 × 10^(-10)) = 5.275 × 10^(-25) kg m/s. Now, the uncertainty in momentum Δp leads to uncertainty in energy ΔE. Kinetic energy E = p^2 / (2m), so ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp, where p = m v. Electron mass m = 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg, p = 9.11 × 10^(-31) × 2 × 10^8 = 1.822 × 10^(-22) kg m/s. Then ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp = (1.822 × 10^(-22) / 9.11 × 10^(-31)) × 5.275 × 10^(-25) = (2 × 10^8) × 5.275 × 10^(-25) = 1.055 × 10^(-16) J. So the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately 10^(-16) J.
