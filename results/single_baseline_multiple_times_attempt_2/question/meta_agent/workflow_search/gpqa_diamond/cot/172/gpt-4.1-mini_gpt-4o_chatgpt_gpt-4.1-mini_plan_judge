Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The principle states that the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) are related by Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js). Given the uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, we can find the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Since p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron (m ≈ 9.10938356 × 10^(-31) kg), we have Δp = m * Δv, and the uncertainty in velocity Δv can be found from Δx * m * Δv ≥ ħ/2. Solving for Δv, we have Δv ≥ ħ/(2mΔx). The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE is then given by ΔE = (1/2) * m * (Δv)^2. Substituting the values, we calculate ΔE to find the answer.
