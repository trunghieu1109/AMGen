Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='A spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics typically leads to the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are collective excitations associated with the broken continuous symmetry. Magnons are spin wave excitations in magnets and are Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions can be understood as approximate Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and can be considered Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in field theories and condensed matter systems but are not themselves Nambu-Goldstone bosons and are not directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetries in the same way. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
