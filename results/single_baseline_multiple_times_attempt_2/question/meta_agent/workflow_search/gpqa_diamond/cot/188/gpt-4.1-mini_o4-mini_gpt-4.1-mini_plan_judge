Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need to identify which of these effective particles is not a Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken symmetry. Magnons arise from broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Phonons are the Goldstone modes of broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes from symmetry breaking.
