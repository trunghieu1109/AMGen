    <pre>A spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics typically leads to the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are collective excitations associated with the broken continuous symmetry. Magnons are spin wave excitations in magnets and are Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions can be understood as approximate Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and can be considered Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in field theories and condensed matter systems but are not themselves Nambu-Goldstone bosons and are not directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetries in the same way. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
