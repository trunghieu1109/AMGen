Question: {'question': 'Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', 'choice1': 'Magnon', 'choice2': 'Skyrmion', 'choice3': 'Pion', 'choice4': 'Phonon'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='We need to identify which of these effective particles is not a Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken symmetry. Magnons arise from broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Phonons are the Goldstone modes of broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes from symmetry breaking.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
