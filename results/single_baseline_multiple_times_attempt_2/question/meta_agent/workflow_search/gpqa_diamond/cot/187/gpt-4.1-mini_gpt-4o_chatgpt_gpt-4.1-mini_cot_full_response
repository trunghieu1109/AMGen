Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent RGi4', content="To find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in terms of the lattice parameters a and the angles α, β, γ. For a rhombohedral system, the formula for the interplanar spacing d_hkl is given by:\n\n1/d_hkl^2 = (h^2 sin^2 α + k^2 sin^2 β + l^2 sin^2 γ + 2hk (cos α cos β - cos γ) + 2kl (cos β cos γ - cos α) + 2hl (cos γ cos α - cos β)) / (1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ)\n\nFor the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1. Given that α = β = γ = 30 degrees and the interatomic distance a = 10 Å, we calculate:\n\ncos(30) = √3/2 and sin(30) = 1/2.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we find the interplanar distance d_111.\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3/8) = 1 - 9/4 + 3/4 = -3/4 + 3/4 = 0.\n\nThis suggests a mistake, so let's recompute carefully:\n\nThe correct denominator is:\n1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3/8) = 1 - 9/4 + 3/4 = 1 - 6/4 = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5.\n\nThe numerator simplifies to:\n3*(1/4) + 3*(3/4 -
