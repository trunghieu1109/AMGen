Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The mean free path (λ1) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum is determined by the gas pressure, temperature, and volume. When the electron beam is initiated, electron scattering with gas molecules affects the effective mean free path (λ2) for electrons. Due to the nature of electron scattering and the interaction cross-section, the electron mean free path in the gas tends to be longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves, but not arbitrarily longer. Typically, the electron mean free path is approximately 1.22 times or greater than the molecular mean free path due to differences in scattering cross-sections and interaction probabilities. Therefore, λ2 is expected to be greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.
