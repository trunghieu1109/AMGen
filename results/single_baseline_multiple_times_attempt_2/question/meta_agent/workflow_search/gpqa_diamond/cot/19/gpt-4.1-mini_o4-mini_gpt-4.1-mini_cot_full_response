Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rU4K', content='The impulse approximation treats the interaction as occurring with a single free nucleon, ignoring binding and final-state interactions. This requires: 1) the current only interacts with individual nucleons, 2) the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon (no final-state interactions), and 4) the nucleon behaves as if unbound (no binding forces). Assumption 3 about non-relativistic quarks is not needed. Thus the correct set is 1,2,4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
