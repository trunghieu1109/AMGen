proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering the energy conservation in the system. The total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is U = (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, all this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy K is given by K = (γ - 1)mc^2. Setting the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy gives (1/2)kA^2 = (γ - 1)mc^2. Solving for γ, we get γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Substituting γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) into this equation and solving for v^2/c^2 gives v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2. Therefore, the maximum speed is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This corresponds to choice 2.
