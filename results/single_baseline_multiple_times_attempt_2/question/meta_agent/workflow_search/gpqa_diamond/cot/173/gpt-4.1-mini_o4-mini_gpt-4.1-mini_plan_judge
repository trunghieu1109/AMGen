Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Initial nucleus mass M=300 GeV/c². Fragments: m1=2m2, m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m2=99 GeV/c², m1=198 GeV/c². Q=0.01M=3 GeV total KE. Classical split: T1_cl=3·m2/(m1+m2)=3·99/297=1 GeV. Exact relativistic: solve 2m1T1+T1²=2m2(3−T1)+(3−T1)² ⇒ T1≈1.005 GeV. Difference ≈0.005 GeV=5 MeV.
