Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Given: Initial nucleus mass M with rest mass energy 300 GeV. After fission, two fragments: one with rest mass 2m, other with rest mass m, so total rest mass = 3m. Given sum of rest masses after fission is 99% of initial mass M, so 3m = 0.99M => m = 0.33M. The mass defect is 1% of M, so energy released (Q) = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. This energy is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments. The two fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let the kinetic energies be T1 (more massive fragment) and T2 (less massive fragment). By conservation of momentum and energy, and considering relativistic effects, the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical kinetic energy T1 can be estimated. Since the kinetic energy is about a few GeV, and the fragments have masses on the order of 100 GeV (since M=300 GeV), their velocities are not negligible compared to the speed of light, so relativistic corrections are important. The difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy for the more massive fragment is on the order of a few MeV. Among the options given, 5 MeV is the most reasonable estimate for the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations.
