Question: {'question': 'An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content='Initial nucleus mass M=300\u2009GeV/c². Fragments: m1=2m2, m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m2=99\u2009GeV/c², m1=198\u2009GeV/c². Q=0.01M=3\u2009GeV total KE. Classical split: T1_cl=3·m2/(m1+m2)=3·99/297=1\u2009GeV. Exact relativistic: solve 2m1T1+T1²=2m2(3−T1)+(3−T1)² ⇒ T1≈1.005\u2009GeV. Difference ≈0.005\u2009GeV=5\u2009MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
