Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question is about the flux of neutrinos from the Sun, specifically from the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, particularly from reactions involving beryllium-8 and boron-8. The neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range are likely from different reactions (such as the pp-I or pp-II branches), whereas those in the 800-900 keV range are more likely to be affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch, which produces higher energy neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range would decrease significantly, while the 700-800 keV range would be less affected. Therefore, the flux ratio of band 1 to band 2 would increase.
