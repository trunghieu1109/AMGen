    <pre>The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos predominantly in the high-energy range, specifically the 800-900 keV range (band 2). If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, neutrinos in that energy range would drop to zero. The 700-800 keV range (band 1) neutrinos come mainly from other branches (pp-I and pp-II), which remain unchanged. Therefore, the flux in band 1 remains the same, while the flux in band 2 drops significantly (to zero or near zero). Hence, the ratio flux(band 1)/flux(band 2) would become very large. Since the question asks for an approximate ratio, and considering the flux in band 2 approaches zero, the ratio would be large (much greater than 1). Among the choices, 10 (choice B) is the only large value, while others are less than or equal to 1. Thus, the best answer is 10.
