Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The state is |ψ>=0.5|↑>+√3/2|↓>. 〈σz〉=|a|^2−|b|^2=0.25−0.75=−0.5. 〈σx〉=2ab=2*(0.5)*(√3/2)=√3/2≈0.866. So 〈10σz+5σx〉=10*(−0.5)+5*(0.866)=−5+4.33=−0.67≈−0.7.
