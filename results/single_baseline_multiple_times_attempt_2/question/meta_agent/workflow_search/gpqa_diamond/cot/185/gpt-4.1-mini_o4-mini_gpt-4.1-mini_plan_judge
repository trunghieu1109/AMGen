Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The aza‐Cope [3,3] rearrangement of N-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene breaks the N–Cα and C5–C6 σ bonds and migrates the π bonds from Cα–Cβ and C5–C6 to N=Cβ (position 1–2 of the pyridine) and C4–C5. Thus the product is a 3H‐cyclopenta[c]pyridine with double bonds at 1–2 and 4–5 (saturations at 3,6,4a,7a), matching choice 3.
