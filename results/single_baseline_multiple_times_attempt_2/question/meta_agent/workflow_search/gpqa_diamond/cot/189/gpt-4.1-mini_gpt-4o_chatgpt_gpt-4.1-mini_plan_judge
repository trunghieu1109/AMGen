Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the reactivity of nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we should consider factors such as the basicity of the nucleophile, the solvent effects, and the nature of the nucleophilic atom. In general, in polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity decreases down a group in the periodic table because larger atoms are less solvated and can attack more easily. Therefore, sulfur-containing nucleophiles like ethanethiolate (5) are typically more nucleophilic than oxygen-containing ones like hydroxide (2). Hydroxide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Alkoxide ions like 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) are also good nucleophiles. Carboxylate ions like propionate (3) are less nucleophilic than alkoxides and thiolates. Methanol (4) is a weak nucleophile because it is neutral and not negatively charged. Based on these considerations, the order from most reactive to least reactive should be ethanethiolate (5), hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), propionate (3), and methanol (4).
