Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions of benzene derivatives with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Ortho/para-directing groups are typically activating, such as alkyl groups and halogens, while meta-directing groups are usually deactivating, such as nitro groups and carboxylic acid groups. The stronger the activation, the higher the para-isomer yield. Nitro (NO2) is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, while carboxyl (COOH) and ester (COOC2H5) groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. Chlorine (Cl) is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. Methyl (CH3) and ethyl (C2H5) are ortho/para-directing and activating. Thus, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield should be: nitro < ester < carboxylic acid < chloro < methyl < ethyl.\n\nAnswer:4<2<6<3<1<5', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
