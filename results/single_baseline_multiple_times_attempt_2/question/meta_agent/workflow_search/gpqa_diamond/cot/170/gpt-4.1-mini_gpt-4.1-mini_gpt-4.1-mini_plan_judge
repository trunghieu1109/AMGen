proposed answer: The question involves electrophilic substitution on monosubstituted benzene rings and asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) generally direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, with a significant para contribution. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) generally direct substitution to the meta position, reducing para substitution. The substituents are: 1) CH3 (methyl, EDG, ortho/para director), 2) COOC2H5 (ester, EWG, meta director), 3) Cl (halogen, ortho/para director but less activating), 4) NO2 (strong EWG, meta director), 5) C2H5 (ethyl, EDG, ortho/para director), 6) COOH (carboxylic acid, EWG, meta director). The order of increasing para-isomer yield should start with strong meta directors (NO2, COOH, COOR), then halogen (Cl), then alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5). Among meta directors, the steric hindrance and resonance effects affect para yield; COOH and COOR have some resonance, NO2 is strongest meta director with least para product. So order of increasing para: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOR) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This matches choice4: '4<6<2<1<5<3'.
