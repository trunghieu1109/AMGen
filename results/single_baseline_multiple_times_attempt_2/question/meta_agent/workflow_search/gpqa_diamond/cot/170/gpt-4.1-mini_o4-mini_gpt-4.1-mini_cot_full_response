Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='Meta-directing groups (NO2, COOH, COOR) give no para product, so 4, 6, 2 are lowest (increasing slightly by weakening deactivation). Among ortho/para directors: chlorobenzene is weak with low para fraction, toluene is higher, and ethylbenzene highest (less steric hindrance at para). Thus order: 4<2<6<3<1<5 (choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
