Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 along any direction. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n, which gives ±ε. Hence, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are +ε and -ε.
