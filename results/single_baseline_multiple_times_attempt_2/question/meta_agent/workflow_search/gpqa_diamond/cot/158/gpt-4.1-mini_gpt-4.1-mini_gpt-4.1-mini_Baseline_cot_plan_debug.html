    <pre>The quasar&#39;s peak emission is observed at 790 nm in the near-infrared/optical spectrum. Assuming the intrinsic emission peak is in the ultraviolet or visible range (e.g., around 121.6 nm for Lyman-alpha line or around 400-500 nm for typical quasar emission lines), the observed wavelength is redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The redshift z can be estimated by z = (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. If we assume the emitted wavelength is around 121.6 nm (Lyman-alpha), then z = (790/121.6) - 1 â‰ˆ 5.5. For a flat Lambda-CDM universe with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for z~5.5 is roughly around 8-9 Gpc. Among the choices, 8 Gpc and 9 Gpc are close, but 8 Gpc is a commonly cited approximate value for such redshift distances. Therefore, the best assumption is 8 Gpc.
