proposed answer: The spin state is given as (3i, 4). We denote the state vector as |ψ> = (3i, 4). The Pauli spin matrix for the y-direction is \sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The expectation value of S_y is given by <ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * <ψ|\sigma_y|ψ>. First, compute \sigma_y|ψ>: \sigma_y * (3i, 4)^T = (0*(-i*4) + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4) = (-i*4, i*3i) = (-4i, 3i^2). Since i^2 = -1, this is (-4i, -3). Now, <ψ| = (3i)*, 4* = (-3i, 4), where * denotes complex conjugate transpose. So <ψ| = (-3i conjugate is 3i, but actually conjugate of 3i is -3i, so careful: conjugate of 3i is -3i) So <ψ| = (-3i, 4) is incorrect; the state is (3i,4), so conjugate transpose is (-3i, 4) or ( -3i, 4 )? Actually, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, so <ψ| = (-3i, 4). Now compute <ψ|\sigma_y|ψ> = (-3i, 4) * (-4i, -3)^T = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = ( -3i * -4i ) + (4 * -3) = (12 * i^2) - 12 = 12*(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24. So <ψ|\sigma_y|ψ> = -24. Therefore, expectation value of S_y = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ. None of the options directly matches -12ħ. Check the options: A) -25ħ/2 = -12.5ħ, B) -12ħ/25 = -0.48ħ, C) 12ħ/25= 0.48ħ, D) 25ħ/2=12.5ħ. The closest is none. Possibly a mistake in calculation. Re-examine the conjugate transpose: The state is (3i,4), so conjugate is (-3i,4). So <ψ| = (-3i, 4). Multiply <ψ| by \sigma_y|ψ>: (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = (-3i)(-4i) + (-12) = (12)(i^2) - 12 = 12*(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24. So the expectation value is -24*(ħ/2) = -12ħ. Since none of the options matches -12ħ, but option B is -12ħ/25, which is close to -0.48ħ, not -12ħ. Option A is -25ħ/2 = -12.5ħ, close to -12ħ. So the answer is closest to option A. So the answer is A).
