Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The disease is caused by a retrovirus, which means its genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Therefore, the initial step should be to convert the viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) before sequencing. DNA sequencing directly from the virus would not be accurate since retroviruses have RNA genomes. Once the viral cDNA is sequenced, a real-time PCR kit can be developed for quick and accurate diagnosis. Real-time PCR is preferred over conventional PCR because it is faster and allows quantification of viral load. Identifying IgG antibodies is useful but not for early or quick diagnosis, as antibodies take time to develop. Designing a nested PCR kit based on symptoms is not precise and not the best approach.
