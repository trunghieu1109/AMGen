Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='Since the disease is caused by a retrovirus, the virus contains RNA as its genetic material. To detect the virus, we need to convert the RNA into cDNA, which can then be sequenced to identify the virus. Once identified, a real-time PCR kit can be developed to detect the virus quickly and accurately. Choice 1 involves DNA sequencing, which is not suitable for a retrovirus. Choice 2 involves detecting antibodies, which is indirect and not as quick as detecting the viral RNA itself. Choice 3 suggests using symptoms for virus identification, which is not reliable. Therefore, the best approach is choice 4, which involves cDNA sequencing and developing a real-time PCR kit.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
