Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Retroviruses carry RNA genomes. For rapid molecular detection you need to reverse-transcribe the viral RNA to cDNA and then perform a real-time PCR assay for sensitivity and speed. cDNA sequencing and conventional PCR (choice A) or nested PCR based on symptoms (choice C) are less ideal. Serology (choice B) detects antibodies, which appear later. Thus the best approach is choice D.
