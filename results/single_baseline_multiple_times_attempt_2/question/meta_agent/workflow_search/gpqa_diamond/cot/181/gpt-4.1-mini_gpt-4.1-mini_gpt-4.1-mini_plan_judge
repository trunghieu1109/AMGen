proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. This equation assumes a trap-free single-carrier device, meaning only one type of charge carrier dominates the conduction. It also assumes that the contacts are Ohmic, which means there is no injection barrier and carriers can be injected easily. Additionally, the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current. Option 1 states a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current, which aligns with the assumptions. Option 2 mentions negligible drift current, which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift current dominates. Option 3 mentions a two-carrier device, which is not consistent with the single-carrier assumption. Option 4 includes a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier and is not consistent with the Ohmic contact assumption. Therefore, the correct statement is choice 1.
