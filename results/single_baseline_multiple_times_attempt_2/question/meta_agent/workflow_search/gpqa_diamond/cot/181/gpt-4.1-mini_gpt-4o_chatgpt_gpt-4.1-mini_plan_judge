Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device where the current is limited by the amount of charge injected into the device, rather than by the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor. This equation assumes a single type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes), and it is valid in the absence of traps, meaning the device is trap-free. Additionally, the contacts are assumed to be Ohmic, meaning there is no barrier to carrier injection, and the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current. Therefore, the correct condition for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is that it is for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current.
