Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which protein complex will be least observed in the assay, we need to consider the context of the experiment. The peptide induces the formation of the shmoo in yeast, which is a response related to mating and signaling rather than DNA replication. The proteome of active chromatin in this context is likely to be involved in transcription and gene expression rather than DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex are involved in transcription, while the nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex, however, is specifically involved in DNA replication, which is not the primary focus during shmoo formation. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex will be least observed in the assay.
