Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ckaO', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to consider the equilibria of cobalt(II) ions with thiocyanate ions. The complex formation can be represented as follows: Co^2+ + SCN^- <-> [Co(SCN)]^+, Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <-> [Co(SCN)_2], Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <-> [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <-> [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. These constants represent the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes relative to the free ions. To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)_2], we use the formula: [% complex] = ([complex] / total [Co]) * 100. The total [Co] is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. We calculate the concentrations of each complex using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-. Let x = [Co^2+]. Then [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1*x*[SCN^-], [Co(SCN)_2] = β2*x*[SCN^-]^2, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3*x*[SCN^-]^3, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4*x*[SCN^-]^4. We solve for x using the mass balance equation: 10^-2 = x + β1*x*[SCN^-] + β2*x*[SCN^-]^2 + β3*x*[SCN^-]^3 + β4*x*[SCN^-]^4. After solving for x, we find the concentration of each complex, particularly [Co(SCN)_2], and calculate its percentage among all cobalt species. After performing these calculations, we find that the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is 25.6%.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
