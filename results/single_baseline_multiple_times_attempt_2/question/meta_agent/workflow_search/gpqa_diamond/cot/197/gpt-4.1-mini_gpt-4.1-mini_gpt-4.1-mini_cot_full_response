Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ckaO', content='Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we need to find the percentage of the Co(SCN)2 complex among all cobalt species. The stability constants (β) for Co(SCN)n complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, corresponding to the formation of Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4 respectively. To find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 (the dithiocyanato complex), we calculate the concentration of each species using the formula: [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [SCN-]^n * [Co2+]. However, since the total Co is 10^-2 M, we set [Co2+] free as x and write the mass balance: total Co = x + β1*x*[SCN-] + β2*x*[SCN-]^2 + β3*x*[SCN-]^3 + β4*x*[SCN-]^4. Plugging in values: 0.01 = x + 9*x*0.1 + 40*x*(0.1)^2 + 63*x*(0.1)^3 + 16*x*(0.1)^4 = x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.016) = x * 2.379. So x = 0.01 / 2.379 ≈ 0.0042 M (free Co2+). Now, concentration of Co(SCN)2 = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.0042 * 0.01 = 0.00168 M. The fraction of Co(SCN)2 is 0.00168 / 0.01 = 0.168 or 16.8%. The closest given choice is 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
