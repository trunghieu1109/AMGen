Question: {'question': 'The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', 'choice1': '1/3\n', 'choice2': '2/3\n', 'choice3': '\\sqrt{2/3}\n', 'choice4': '1'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent j36X', content='The state is |ψ> = (-1,2,1)/√6. The operator P has eigenvalue 0 with eigenvector v0 = (1,0,-1)/√2. The overlap is <v0|ψ> = (1/√2)(-1/√6)+(−1/√2)(1/√6) = −1/√3. The probability is |−1/√3|^2 = 1/3.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
