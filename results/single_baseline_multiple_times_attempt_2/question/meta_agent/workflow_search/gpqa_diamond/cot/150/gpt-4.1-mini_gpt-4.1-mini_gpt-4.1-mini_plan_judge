Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, we normalize the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The observable P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We want the probability that the measurement yields 0. This means we want the projector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P.

Let's find the eigenvalues of P.

The characteristic polynomial is det(P - λI) = 0.

P - λI = [[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
           [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
           [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]]

Compute determinant:
= -λ * det([[-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ]]) - (1/sqrt(2)) * det([[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ]]) + 0

First minor:
det([[-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ]]) = (-λ)*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) = λ^2 - 1/2

Second minor:
det([[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ]]) = (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ / sqrt(2)

So determinant:
= -λ*(λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ / sqrt(2))
= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ
= λ - λ^3
= λ(1 - λ^2)

Set equal to zero:
λ(1 - λ^2) = 0

Eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = +1, λ = -1.

We want the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0:
Solve (P - 0*I) x = 0

P x = 0
So,
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] [x1]   = 0
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] [x2] = 0
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] [x3]   = 0

Equations:
1) (0)*x1 + (1/sqrt(2))*x2 + 0*x3 = 0 => (1/sqrt(2))*x2 = 0 => x2 = 0
2) (1/sqrt(2))*x1 + 0*x2 + (1/sqrt(2))*x3 = 0 => (1/sqrt(2))*x1 + (1/sqrt(2))*x3 = 0 => x1 + x3 = 0 => x3 = -x1
3) 0*x1 + (1/sqrt(2))*x2 + 0*x3 = 0 => same as 1), x2=0

So eigenvector is (x1, 0, -x1) = x1*(1,0,-1). Normalize:
norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)

Normalized eigenvector: (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

Projector onto eigenvalue 0 eigenspace is |v><v| where v = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

Probability = |<v|ψ>|^2

Calculate <v|ψ>:
ψ normalized = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))

<v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))
= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 - (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))
= -1/(sqrt(12)) - 1/(sqrt(12))
= -2/(sqrt(12))

sqrt(12) = sqrt(4*3) = 2*sqrt(3)

So <v|ψ> = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3)

Probability = |<v|ψ>|^2 = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3
