    <pre>First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000935 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with a strong acid (monobasic) according to the reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve completely. Therefore, moles of H+ needed = 3 × 0.000935 mol = 0.002805 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so volume of acid solution needed = moles / concentration = 0.002805 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02805 L = 28.05 cm3. After adding 28.05 cm3 of acid to make a total volume of 100 cm3, the remaining acid concentration can be found. Total moles of acid added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol. Moles of acid consumed = 0.002805 mol (to dissolve Fe(OH)3). So, no free H+ remains from the acid. However, the solution will contain Fe3+ ions which can hydrolyze and affect pH. But since the acid is strong and monobasic and just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the pH will be determined by the remaining acid concentration (if any). Given that the acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the pH will be low but not extremely low. Among the options, pH 2.04 with 28.05 cm3 volume matches the calculations. Hence, choice A is correct.
