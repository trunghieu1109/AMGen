Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First calculate moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.85 g·mol⁻¹ = 0.000936 mol. Reaction needs 3 H+ per mole: 3×0.000936 = 0.002808 mol H+. At 0.1 M acid that requires 0.002808/0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³ (≈28.05 cm³). That matches choice A. Since acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, leftover H+ arises from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis. Using Ka₁≈6.3×10⁻³ and C(Fe³⁺)=0.000936/0.1 L=0.00936 M, approximate pH ≈2.04. Thus A is correct.
