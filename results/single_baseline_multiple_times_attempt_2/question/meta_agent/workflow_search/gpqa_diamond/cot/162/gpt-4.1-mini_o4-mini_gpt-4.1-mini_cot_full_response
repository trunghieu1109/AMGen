Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DmaR', content='First calculate moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.85 g·mol⁻¹ = 0.000936 mol. Reaction needs 3 H+ per mole: 3×0.000936 = 0.002808 mol H+. At 0.1 M acid that requires 0.002808/0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³ (≈28.05 cm³). That matches choice A. Since acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, leftover H+ arises from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis. Using Ka₁≈6.3×10⁻³ and C(Fe³⁺)=0.000936/0.1 L=0.00936 M, approximate pH ≈2.04. Thus A is correct.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
