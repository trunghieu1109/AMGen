proposed answer: We have metric ds^2 = 32/(4 – r^2)(dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2). The area element is dA = √g dr dθ = (32 r)/(4 – r^2) dr dθ. Integrating θ from 0 to 2π and r from 0 to 2 gives A = 2π·32 ∫_0^2 r/(4 – r^2) dr. The integral diverges (logarithmic divergence as r→2). Therefore the area is infinite.
