Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid will produce diastereomeric diols. The (E) and (Z) isomers lead to different stereochemistry in the epoxide and subsequently in the diol after acid treatment. Each alkene stereoisomer will give a pair of enantiomers (due to the formation of two stereocenters in the diol), so from (E)-oct-4-ene we get two enantiomers (a racemic mixture), and from (Z)-oct-4-ene we get another two enantiomers (another racemic mixture). Therefore, the mixture contains four stereoisomers: two pairs of enantiomers which are diastereomeric to each other. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute, so each pair of enantiomers appears as one peak; since there are two diastereomeric pairs, we expect 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each pair of enantiomers gives two peaks; with two diastereomeric pairs, we expect 4 peaks. Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
