Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Let's analyze the reactions. Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. This will form an epoxide intermediate, which upon treatment with acid, will open to form a diol. The (E)-alkene will lead to a trans-diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene, which will similarly form an epoxide and then a diol, but this time a cis-diol. So we have two different diols: a trans-diol from (E)-oct-4-ene and a cis-diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene. On a standard reverse-phase HPLC, which is achiral, these two diols (cis and trans) will have different retention times, resulting in 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the trans-diol will have two enantiomers, and the cis-diol will also have two enantiomers, leading to 4 peaks. Thus, the answer is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
