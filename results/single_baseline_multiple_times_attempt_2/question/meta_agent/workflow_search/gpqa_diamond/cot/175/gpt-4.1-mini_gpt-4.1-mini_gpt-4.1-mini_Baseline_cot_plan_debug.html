    <pre>First, we identify the state vector |ψ&gt; = (-1, 2, 1). The operators P and Q are given by matrices: 
P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]
Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]

We want the probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

Step 1: Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Check the eigenvalues of P:
P is symmetric, so eigenvalues are real.

We solve P|v&gt; = 0|v&gt; = 0.

Let |v&gt; = (x, y, z). Then:
Row 1: 0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 =&gt; (1/√2)*y = 0 =&gt; y = 0
Row 2: (1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0 =&gt; (1/√2)*x + (1/√2)*z = 0 =&gt; x + z = 0 =&gt; z = -x
Row 3: 0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 =&gt; (1/√2)*y = 0 =&gt; y = 0 (already found)

So eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v&gt; = (x, 0, -x) = x*(1,0,-1).
Normalize: norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Step 2: Project initial state |ψ&gt; onto this eigenvector to find the state after measurement of P=0.

|ψ&gt; = (-1, 2, 1)
|v&gt; = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

Projection amplitude c = &lt;v|ψ&gt; = (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 - (1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2

Probability of measuring 0 for P is |c|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2, but since |ψ&gt; is not normalized, we must normalize |ψ&gt; first.

Normalize |ψ&gt;:
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6)
Normalized |ψ&gt; = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)

Now c = (1/√2)*(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)*(1/√6) = (-1)/(√2√6) - (1)/(√2√6) = -2/(√2√6) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3

Probability P=0 = |c|^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3

Step 3: After measurement of P=0, the state collapses to |v&gt; = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

Step 4: Now measure Q and want probability of getting -1.

Q eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors:
For eigenvalue -1: eigenvector is (0,0,1)

Probability of measuring Q=-1 is |&lt;eigenvector Q=-1 | state&gt;|^2

State after P=0 measurement is |v&gt; = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)
Eigenvector for Q=-1 is |w&gt; = (0,0,1)

Overlap = &lt;w|v&gt; = 0* (1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2

Probability = |overlap|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2

Step 5: Total probability = Probability(P=0) * Probability(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6

Answer corresponds to choice2: 1/6.
