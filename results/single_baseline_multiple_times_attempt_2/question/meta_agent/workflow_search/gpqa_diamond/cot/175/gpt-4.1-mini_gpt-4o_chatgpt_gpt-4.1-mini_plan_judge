Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we first need to find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, we project the initial state onto this eigenvector to find the state after measuring P. Next, we find the eigenvector of operator Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. Finally, we calculate the probability of the post-P-measurement state being found in the -1 eigenstate of Q. The matrix P is given by:

P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

The eigenvectors of P need to be found. The eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector v_0 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]. The initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]. Projecting |ψ> onto v_0 gives the component of |ψ> in the direction of v_0. After measuring P and getting the eigenvalue 0, the state collapses to |ψ'> = c * v_0, where c is the projection coefficient. Next, we consider the operator Q:

Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]

The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector v_Q = [0, 0, 1]. We calculate the probability of |ψ'> being in the state |v_Q>, which is |<v_Q|ψ'>|^2. After finding the relevant projections and normalizations, the final probability is 1/6.
