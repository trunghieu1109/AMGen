Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We want the maximum orbital period P2 of a second planet that still shows both transit and occultation given the inclination fixed by the first planet’s impact parameter b1=0.2. For a circular, co-planar orbit: b1=(a1 cos i)/R*, so cos i= b1 R*/a1. For the second planet to transit (and occult), its impact parameter b2=(a2 cos i)/R* must satisfy b2≤1−Rp2/R*. Hence a2_max = (1−Rp2/R*) R*/cos i = (a1/0.2)×(1−Rp2/R*). Thus a2_max/a1 =5×(1−Rp2/R*). With Rp2=2.5 Re and R*=1.5 R☉=1.5×109 Re, Rp2/R*≈0.0153 ⇒1−≈0.9847 ⇒a2_max/a1≈4.9237. Then P2_max/P1=(a2/a1)^(3/2)=4.9237^(1.5)≈10.93, so P2_max≈3 d×10.93≈32.8 d ≈33.5 d.
