    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometric constraints of the system. The key constraint is that the second planet must have an orbit that allows it to pass both in front of and behind the star from our line of sight. The transit impact parameter b is given as 0.2 for the first planet, which means the first planet transits the star at a distance of 0.2 times the star&#39;s radius from the star&#39;s center. For a second planet to also transit, it must have an impact parameter less than 1, meaning it must pass within the star&#39;s disk. However, for it to also be occulted, it must pass behind the star, meaning its orbit must be such that the star&#39;s radius plus the planet&#39;s radius is less than or equal to the semi-major axis times the sine of the inclination angle. Given the first planet has a period of 3 days, we can use Kepler&#39;s third law to relate the semi-major axis of the orbit to the period. The semi-major axis a is proportional to the cube root of the period squared. The maximum period that allows for both transits and occultations is determined by the condition that the orbital plane allows the planet to be behind the star. Since the star&#39;s radius is 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius, we calculate the maximum period using the geometry of the system. The maximum period corresponds to the condition where the planet&#39;s orbital plane is tangent to the star&#39;s disk, leading to the longest possible period while still allowing for occultation. The maximum period is given by the ratio of the star&#39;s radius to the semi-major axis, considering the orbital period of the first planet and the scaling with the planet&#39;s radius. Calculating this, we find that the maximum period consistent with both transits and occultations is approximately 33.5 days.
