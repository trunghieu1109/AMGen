    <pre>Given the first planet&#39;s parameters, the star radius is 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius, and the planet radius is 1 Earth radius. The impact parameter is 0.2, which means the transit chord is slightly offset from the center of the star. The planet&#39;s orbital period is 3 days. For the second planet, with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, to exhibit both transit and occultation, it must have an orbit such that it passes in front of and behind the star from our line of sight. The maximum orbital period for the second planet to have both transit and occultation events depends on the inclination and the size of the star relative to the orbit. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the maximum impact parameter for the second planet to still transit and occult is related to the star radius and the planet&#39;s orbital distance. The first planet has a small impact parameter (0.2) and a 3-day period, indicating it is close to the star. The second planet must be further out but still aligned enough to transit and occult. The maximum orbital period is therefore larger than 3 days but limited by the geometry. Among the choices, ~7.5 days is too close; ~33.5 and ~37.5 days are quite long; ~12.5 days seems reasonable as a maximum period allowing both events given the larger planet size and orbital geometry. Therefore, the best choice is D) ~12.5.
