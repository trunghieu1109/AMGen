Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Michael addition involves nucleophilic attack at the β-position of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For reaction A, dimethyl malonate (a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound) reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under basic conditions (NaOEt, EtOH), leading to a Michael adduct where the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The product is a trimethyl tricarboxylate derivative with the p-tolyl group at the 3-position relative to the malonate core. For reaction B, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile under MeOH and acidic conditions, leading to a Michael adduct where the 2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl group is attached to butanenitrile. For reaction C, with but-3-en-2-one and a compound C under KOH and water, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which suggests that C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, as this compound can undergo Michael addition to give the product. Matching these observations with the choices, choice 3 correctly identifies A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B as 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, and C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.
