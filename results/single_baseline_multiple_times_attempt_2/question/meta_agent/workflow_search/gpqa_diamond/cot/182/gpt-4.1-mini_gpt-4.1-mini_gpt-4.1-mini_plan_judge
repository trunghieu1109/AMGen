Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) or degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula: IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1, where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens. The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, which has multiple unsaturations: one aldehyde group, one vinyl group (double bond), one alkene in the ring, and a carboxylic acid group (which includes a carbonyl double bond). When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to corresponding hydrocarbons (removing the carbonyl double bonds), and the vinyl group may be reduced to an alkane. This reduces the number of double bonds and thus the IHD decreases. Initially, the molecule has 3 double bonds (aldehyde, alkene, vinyl) plus the carboxylic acid carbonyl, so total 4 double bonds, corresponding to IHD = 4. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, all these double bonds are reduced, so IHD becomes 1 (due to the ring). Therefore, the product has an IHD of 1.
