Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has an aldehyde group, a vinyl group, a cyclohexene ring, and a carboxylic acid group. When it is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, it undergoes exhaustive hydrogenation, which reduces all double bonds and functional groups to alkanes. The resulting product is a fully saturated cyclohexane derivative, with the aldehyde, vinyl, and carboxylic acid groups all reduced to alkyl groups. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product is 0, as there are no rings or double bonds left.
