Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The HI/red P reagent reduces both the –COOH and –CHO groups to –CH3 without affecting the C=C bonds. The ring retains its one double bond and the vinyl substituent remains. The product has C10H16, giving IHD = (2·10+2–16)/2 = 3, corresponding to three degrees of unsaturation (one ring + two C=C).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
