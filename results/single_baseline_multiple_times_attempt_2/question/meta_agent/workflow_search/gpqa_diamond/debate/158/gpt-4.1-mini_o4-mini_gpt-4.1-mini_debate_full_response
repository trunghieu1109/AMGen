In a flat ΛCDM with H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7 the comoving distance to z=5.5 is c/H0 ∫0^z dz′/√(Ωm(1+z′)3+ΩΛ). Numerically (e.g. trapezoidal integration of 1/E(z)), ∫0^5.5 dz′/E≈1.88 ⇒ DC≈(c/H0)×1.88≈4282.7\u2009Mpc×1.88≈8066\u2009Mpc≈8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fldN:\nWe observe a sharp drop at 790 nm in the quasar spectrum, which corresponds to the redshifted Lyα (121.6 nm) break, giving z ≈ (790/121.6) − 1 ≈ 5.5. In a flat ΛCDM with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is roughly 25.7 Gly. Converting to Gpc (1 Gpc ≈3.26 Gly) yields ~7.9 Gpc, i.e. ~8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent kLLR:\nThe observed break at 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman α forest drop at 121.6 nm rest, giving z ≃ (790/121.6)–1 ≃ 5.5. For ΛCDM with H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is ≈7.8 Gpc, so about 8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Fr2v:\nThe drop at λ≲790 nm is the Lyman-α break (rest 121.6 nm), so (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In ΛCDM (H₀=70,Ωₘ=0.3,Ω_Λ=0.7) the line–of–sight comoving distance is χ=c/H₀∫₀^{z}dz/E(z). Numerically ∫₀^{5.5}dz/√(0.3(1+z)³+0.7)≈1.88, so χ≈(3×10⁵/70)×1.88 Mpc≈8.1 Gpc.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Kdyo:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fldN:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent kLLR:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Fr2v:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
