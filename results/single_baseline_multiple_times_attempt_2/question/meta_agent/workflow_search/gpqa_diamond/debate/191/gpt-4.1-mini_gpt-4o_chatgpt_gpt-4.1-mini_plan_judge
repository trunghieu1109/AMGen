Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity within a conductor. The conductor will redistribute its charges such that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. This means that the charge +q will induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor. For points outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the charge +q on the outer surface, which behaves as if it is a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor depends only on the total charge +q and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Since L is the distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P, the electric field E at point P is given by Coulomb's law as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Thus, the correct answer is choice 4.
