    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
A charge +q inside a cavity induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. The conductor shields internal charge distribution, so outside the sphere the field is as if a point charge +q at its center. Thus E = q/(4πε₀L²).

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
A charge +q placed inside a cavity of a conductor induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law, the external field depends only on the net charge +q on the conductor and behaves as if this charge is at the center of the sphere. Hence E at distance L is (1/4πε₀)·q/L².

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
In electrostatic equilibrium, the induced charges ensure the external field is as if the total charge +q resides at the conductor&#39;s center regardless of cavity offset. Thus at distance L from the center, E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
The net external field of a charged conductor with an off‐center cavity is as if all induced charge +q on the outer surface sits at the conductor’s center (spherical symmetry). Hence at distance L from the center, E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2.
