    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
The uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity will redistribute its charges such that the electric field inside the conductor&#39;s material is zero. The charge +q inside the cavity will induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the charge +q on the outer surface, which behaves as if it is a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor depends only on the total charge +q and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Since L is the distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P, the electric field E at point P is given by Coulomb&#39;s law as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
The problem involves a charged cavity within a conductor. By electrostatic shielding, the conductor&#39;s outer surface will have an induced charge that exactly cancels the field due to the charge inside the cavity. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at any point outside the conductor depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor to that point.

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. The outer surface of the conductor will have an equal positive charge to maintain the conductor as a whole neutral. The electric field outside the conductor due to the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces can be considered as if the entire charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor, not on the specific configuration inside the cavity. Hence, the magnitude of the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined by the distance L from the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
In this problem, we have a charged particle inside a cavity within a conductor. The key principle here is that the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. Therefore, the charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field due to the conductor can be considered as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at point P is due to the charge +q at the center of the conductor, which is at a distance L from point P. The electric field at point P is given by Coulomb&#39;s law for a point charge at a distance L. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 4.
