The conductor shields internal charge distribution, so outside the sphere the field is as if a point charge +q at its center. Thus E = q/(4πε₀L²).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:\nA charge +q placed inside a cavity of a conductor induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law, the external field depends only on the net charge +q on the conductor and behaves as if this charge is at the center of the sphere. Hence E at distance L is (1/4πε₀)·q/L².\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:\nIn electrostatic equilibrium, the induced charges ensure the external field is as if the total charge +q resides at the conductor's center regardless of cavity offset. Thus at distance L from the center, E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:\nThe net external field of a charged conductor with an off‐center cavity is as if all induced charge\u2009+q on the outer surface sits at the conductor’s center (spherical symmetry). Hence at distance L from the center, E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent uh70:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent z13v:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FuR4:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9Us2:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
