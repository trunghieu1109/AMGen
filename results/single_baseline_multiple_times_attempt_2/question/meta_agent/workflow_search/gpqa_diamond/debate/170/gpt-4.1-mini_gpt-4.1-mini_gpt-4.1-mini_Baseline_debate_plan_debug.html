### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
The question involves electrophilic substitution on monosubstituted benzene derivatives with bromine. The substituents influence the orientation and the ratio of ortho, meta, and para products. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions, often with a high para yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) deactivate the ring and direct substitution to meta positions, typically resulting in lower para product yield.

Let&#39;s analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an EDG (activating, ortho/para director).
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Ester is an EWG (deactivating, meta director).
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Cl is a halogen, weakly deactivating but ortho/para director.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): NO2 is a strong EWG, meta director.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Ethyl is an EDG (activating, ortho/para director).
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Carboxyl is an EWG, meta director.

Expected order of increasing para-isomer yield:
Strong meta directors (NO2) give lowest para yield.
Then other meta directors (COOC2H5, COOH) with slightly higher para yield.
Weakly deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) would have higher para yield than meta directors.
Strongly activating ortho/para directors (CH3, C2H5) give highest para yield.

So the order should be:
4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5)

This matches choice 2 exactly.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
The problem asks to arrange the substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination. The substituents on the benzene ring influence the orientation and distribution of the bromination products. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) typically activate the ring and direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, often increasing the para-isomer yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) deactivate the ring and tend to direct substitution to the meta position, reducing para-isomer yield.

Let&#39;s analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): ester is an EWG, meta directing, low para yield.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): halogen is deactivating but ortho/para directing, moderate para yield.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): strong EWG, meta directing, very low para yield.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): alkyl is EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxyl is EWG, meta directing, low para yield.

Ranking from lowest to highest para-isomer yield based on substituent effects:
4 (NO2) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5)

This matches choice 4: 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3. However, note that halogen (Cl) is ortho/para directing but deactivating, so para yield is less than strong EDGs but more than EWGs. The given order places Cl last, which is inconsistent with the typical directing effects. Choice 2: 4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5 puts Cl after 6, which is more reasonable.

Between choices 2 and 4, choice 2 better reflects the para-isomer yield considering the directing effects and deactivation:
4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (ester) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5).

Therefore, choice 2 is the correct order.

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
The question involves electrophilic bromination of substituted benzene derivatives and the relative amounts of para-isomer formed. The substituents influence the directing effect and the ratio of ortho/para products.

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an electron-donating group (EDG), ortho/para directing, with a good amount of para product.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Ester is electron-withdrawing (EWG), meta directing, less para product.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Halogen is deactivating but ortho/para directing, moderate para product.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Strong EWG, meta directing, very little para product.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Alkyl group, EDG, ortho/para directing, good para product.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Carboxyl is EWG, meta directing, low para product.

Increasing weight fraction of para-isomer corresponds to increasing para selectivity.

From least to most para product:
4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5)

Looking at the options, choice 2 is &#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39; which matches this order.

Therefore, the answer is B).

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
The question involves electrophilic substitution on monosubstituted benzene rings and the relative amounts of para-isomer formed. The substituents affect the orientation and the ratio of ortho/para/meta products. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) direct to ortho and para positions, usually giving more para product, whereas electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) are meta-directing and give less para product. 

Let&#39;s analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an EDG, ortho/para director with significant para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): ester is EWG, meta-directing, less para product.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): halogen is deactivating but ortho/para directing; moderate para yield.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): strong EWG, meta-directing, very low para yield.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): alkyl group, EDG, ortho/para director, high para yield.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxyl is EWG, meta-directing, low para yield.

Order of increasing para yield (from low to high): strong EWG (NO2) &lt; moderate EWG (COOH, ester) &lt; halogen &lt; alkyl groups.

So expected order is:
4 (NO2) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5)

This matches choice 4: &#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39; except the last two are swapped. But choice 4 is &#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39; which matches our reasoning except that Cl is last which is questionable because Cl is ortho/para director but less activating than alkyl groups. Alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5) give more para than Cl.

Choice 2 is &#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39; which puts 2 before 6, but ester is more electron withdrawing than COOH, so 2 should be less para than 6. So 2&lt;6 is questionable.

Choice 3 and 1 are less consistent.

Therefore, the best matching answer is choice 4: &#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39;. Although Cl last is debatable, it is the best fit.

Hence, answer is D).

    <pre>The question asks to arrange the substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) like alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5) direct substitution to ortho and para positions, generally increasing the para-isomer yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like NO2, COOH, and esters are meta directors and reduce para-isomer yield. Halogens (Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing, giving moderate para yield. Considering these effects, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield should be: 4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5). This matches choice 2 exactly. Although there is some debate about the exact order of 2 and 6, and the position of 3, choice 2 best fits the general directing effects and para-isomer yields. Therefore, the final answer is B).
