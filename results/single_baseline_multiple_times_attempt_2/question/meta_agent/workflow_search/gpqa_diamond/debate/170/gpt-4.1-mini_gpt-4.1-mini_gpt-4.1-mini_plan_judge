Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks to arrange the substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) like alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5) direct substitution to ortho and para positions, generally increasing the para-isomer yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like NO2, COOH, and esters are meta directors and reduce para-isomer yield. Halogens (Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing, giving moderate para yield. Considering these effects, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield should be: 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This matches choice 2 exactly. Although there is some debate about the exact order of 2 and 6, and the position of 3, choice 2 best fits the general directing effects and para-isomer yields. Therefore, the final answer is B).
