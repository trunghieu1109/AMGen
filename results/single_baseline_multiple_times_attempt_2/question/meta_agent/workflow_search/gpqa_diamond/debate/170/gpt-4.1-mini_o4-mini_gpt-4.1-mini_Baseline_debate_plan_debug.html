### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
We rank substituents by their para–isomer fraction in bromination. Strong meta director –NO2 gives almost no para (lowest), then –COOH is next strongest deactivator (meta) so next-lowest para, then –COOC2H5 is a weaker meta director so higher para. Activators CH3 and C2H5 give ortho/para directors: toluene (CH3) gives ca. 40% p, ethylbenzene slightly more, and Cl (deactivating but o/p director) gives highest p (ca. 60%). Thus the increasing order is 4 (NO2) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5) &lt; 3 (Cl), which is choice 4 (D).

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
Meta directors (2, 4, 6) give essentially zero para product, so they occupy the lowest positions. Among ortho/para directors, chlorobenzene (3) gives the smallest para fraction, toluene (1) a higher one, and ethylbenzene (5) the highest. Thus the order is 4 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 3 &lt; 1 &lt; 5, i.e. choice 2, which is B).

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
We need the relative para‐isomer fractions for electrophilic bromination of six benzene derivatives:

Meta‐directors (give low para yields): 4) –NO2 is strongest, so gives the smallest p; 6) –COOH is next; 2) –COOC2H5 is milder, so p(2)&gt;p(6)&gt;p(4).

Ortho/para‐directors (give higher p, but with steric effects): 1) –CH3 gives more ortho than para (p≈36%); 5) –C2H5 is bulkier so p≈48%; 3) –Cl is deactivating yet directs o/p favoring para somewhat more (p≈52%). Thus p(1)&lt;p(5)&lt;p(3).

Combining: 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3, which is choice4⇒D).

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
We need to order the six benzene derivatives by the weight fraction of the para‐bromo isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. Meta directors (–NO2 #4, –COOH #6, –COOC2H5 #2) give essentially zero para product, so they go first. Among ortho/para directors: CH3 (#1), C2H5 (#5), and Cl (#3), the strongest resonance director (Cl) gives the highest p fraction, while alkyls give less (with CH3 slightly less than C2H5). Thus the ascending order is: 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3, which is choice D).

    <pre>Meta directors give very little para product, with strength order: –NO2 (4) strongest → lowest p fraction; –COOH (6) next; –COOR (2) weakest meta director of the three. Ortho/para directors: –CH3 (1) gives moderate p, –C2H5 (5) bulkier so more para, and –Cl (3) a deactivating o/p director that gives the highest para fraction. Thus ascending: 4 &lt; 6 &lt; 2 &lt; 1 &lt; 5 &lt; 3, which is choice 4 (D).
