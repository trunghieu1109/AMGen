Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Meta directors give very little para product, with strength order: –NO2 (4) strongest → lowest p fraction; –COOH (6) next; –COOR (2) weakest meta director of the three. Ortho/para directors: –CH3 (1) gives moderate p, –C2H5 (5) bulkier so more para, and –Cl (3) a deactivating o/p director that gives the highest para fraction. Thus ascending: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, which is choice 4 (D).
