    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --&gt;(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --&gt; (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---&gt; 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent VApC:
First, identify the Michael donor and acceptor in each reaction and predict the 1,4-addition product, then name the tricarboxylate, the nitrile ketone, and the dione precursor.

(A) Dimethyl malonate attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate to give a trimethyl tricarboxylate with two esters on the malonate carbon and one from the acrylate, and the p-tolyl on the remaining carbon. Correct systematic name is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

(B) The cyclohexenamine derived from cyclohexanone attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile in a Michael reaction; hydrolysis regenerates the ketone, giving 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

(C) Cyclohexane-1,3-dione enolate adds to but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone) to give the 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the Michael donor C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Matching these to the choices, only choice 4 has the correct B and C and is the closest match for A among the given options.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6iCN:
For A: 1,4‐addition of the malonate enolate to methyl 3‐(p-tolyl)acrylate gives a trimethyl tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl on C2 of the propane main chain and esters at C1,C1,C3 → trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For B: the enamine of cyclohexanone adds to crotononitrile then hydrolyzes to give the ketonitrile 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For C: the Michael donor is cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the active methylene, keto form) which adds to methyl vinyl ketone to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Only choice 4 matches all.

### thinking by Debate Agent DmaR:
For reaction A: dimethyl malonate adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate giving a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl on C2: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For B: the enamine adds to but-2-enenitrile and hydrolysis yields the ketone with nitrile substitution at the β-carbon: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For C: the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione adds to methyl vinyl ketone to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. These correspond to choice4, i.e. D).

### thinking by Debate Agent MasV:
Reaction A yields a trimethyl propane tricarboxylate with two esters on the malonate carbon (C1) and one at C3, with the p-tolyl at C2: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Reaction B uses the enamine of cyclohexanone (1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine) to Michael add to but-2-enenitrile, then hydrolyze, giving 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Reaction C is a simple Michael of cyclohexane-1,3-dione with methyl vinyl ketone to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C must be the diketone, not its enol. These match choice 4.
