Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In reaction A the malonate enolate adds 1,4 to methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate giving trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate; in B the cyclohexanone enamine adds to crotononitrile then hydrolyzes to 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile; in C cyclohexane-1,3-dione enolate gives 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione. These correspond to choice 4, i.e. D).
