proposed answer: To determine the detectability of each star using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and compare it to the spectrograph's sensitivity. The ESPRESSO spectrograph can detect stars with an apparent magnitude of around 16 or brighter for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

Let's calculate the apparent magnitude for each star:

- Canopus (a) has an apparent magnitude of about -0.74, which is easily detectable.
- Polaris (b) has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98, which is also detectable.
- Star (c) at 10 pc with M = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(10) - 1) = 15. This is detectable.
- Star (d) at 200 pc with M = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(200) - 1) = 20.5. This is too faint and likely undetectable.
- Star (e) at 5 pc with M = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(5) - 1) = 13.5. This is detectable.
- Star (f) at 50 pc with M = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(50) - 1) = 19.5. This is too faint and likely undetectable.

Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), Star (c), and Star (e), making a total of 4 stars.
