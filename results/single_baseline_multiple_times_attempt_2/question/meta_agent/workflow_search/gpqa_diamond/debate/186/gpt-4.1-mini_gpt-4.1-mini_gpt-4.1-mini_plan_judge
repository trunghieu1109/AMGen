Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The key to solving this problem is to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and compare it to the detection limit of the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope, which is approximately V=16 mag for achieving S/N=10 in a 1-hour exposure. Canopus and Polaris are very bright stars and easily detectable. For the stars with absolute magnitude 15, the apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5. Calculations show that stars at 5 pc (m=13.5) and 10 pc (m=15) are detectable, while those at 50 pc (m=18.5) and 200 pc (m=21.5) are too faint. Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 10 pc, totaling 4 stars. This matches the choice '4'.
