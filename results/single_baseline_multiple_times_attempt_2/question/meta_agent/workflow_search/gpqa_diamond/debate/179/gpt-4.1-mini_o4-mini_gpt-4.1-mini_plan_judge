Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have one central charge q=2e and 12 charges on a sphere of radius R=2 m. Total energy U = sum of k q_i q_j / r_ij over all pairs. Central–outer pairs (12 at distance 2 m) give U_c =12·k(2e)^2/2 =24 k e^2. Outer–outer pairs arranged at icosahedron vertices: distances r_ij are 2×{1.05146 (30 pairs),1.7040 (30),2.0 (6)}, so Σ1/r =½[30/1.05146+30/1.7040+6/2] ≃24.57. Thus U_o =k(2e)^2·24.57=98.28 k e^2. Total U=(24+98.28) k e^2 ≃122.28·(8.9876×10^9·(1.602×10^−19)^2) ≃2.82×10^−26 J, matching choice A).
