Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges. Each charge is 2e, and there are 12 charges at a distance of 2 m from a fixed charge at point P. The potential energy between two charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r. Here, q1 = q2 = 2e, and r = 2 m. The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of the 12 pairs. Calculating this gives U_total = 12 * (8.99 x 10^9) * (4 * (1.6 x 10^-19)^2) / 2. This simplifies to approximately 5.645 x 10^-26 J, which matches choice B).
