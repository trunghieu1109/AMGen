Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Step 1: NaH/BnBr benzylates the primary alcohol to a benzyl ether. Step 2: p-TsNHNH2 converts the ketone to a tosylhydrazone. Step 3: n-BuLi induces a Shapiro reaction, giving an exocyclic alkene at C1. Step 4: H2/Pd hydrogenates both alkenes (isopropenyl→isopropyl, exocyclic CH2=→CH3) and cleaves the benzyl ether to regenerate the free alcohol. The product is a saturated cyclohexane with a CH2OH at C3 and an isopropyl at C5, i.e. (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
