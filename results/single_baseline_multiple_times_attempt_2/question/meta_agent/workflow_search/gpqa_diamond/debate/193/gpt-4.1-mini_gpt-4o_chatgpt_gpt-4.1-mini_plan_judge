Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The partition function Z is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors for all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 configurations. The energy for each configuration is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Calculating the energy for each configuration and the corresponding Boltzmann factor, we find: 1) S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or -1 gives E = -3J, contributing 2e^(3Jβ); 2) Two spins aligned and one opposite (e.g., S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1) gives E = J, contributing 6e^(-Jβ). Summing these contributions, we get Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). This matches choice A).
