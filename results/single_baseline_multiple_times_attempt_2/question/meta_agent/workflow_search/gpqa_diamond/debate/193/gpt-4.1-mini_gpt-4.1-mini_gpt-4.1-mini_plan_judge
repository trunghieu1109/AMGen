Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The system has three spins S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Enumerating all configurations, we find that two configurations have energy -3J and six configurations have energy J. The partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^(-beta * E), which equals 2 * e^{3J beta} + 6 * e^{-J beta}. This matches choice A.
