Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: There are 8 spin configurations. When all spins align (2 states), S1S2+S1S3+S2S3=3, giving E=-3J and weight e^{3Jβ}. The 6 remaining states have one spin flipped, giving sum -1, E=+J and weight e^{-Jβ}. Hence Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ}, which is choice A).
