Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the uncertainty ΔP_z for a given state vector in the eigenbasis of P_z. The eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). First, calculate the expectation value <P_z> = Σ |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i = (1/4)*ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. Next, calculate <P_z^2> = Σ |c_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2 = (1/4)*ħ^2 + 0 + (1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. The variance is <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2 = (1/2)ħ^2 - 0 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ/√2. This matches the answers given by most agents and is consistent with the calculations.
