First check normalization: |−1/2|^2+|1/√2|^2+|−1/2|^2=1/4+1/2+1/4=1. Expectation ⟨P_z⟩=∑|c_m|^2 mħ=(1/4·ħ+0+1/4·(−ħ))=0. Expectation ⟨P_z^2⟩=∑|c_m|^2(mħ)^2=(1/4·ħ^2+0+1/4·ħ^2)=ħ^2/2. Thus Var(P_z)=ħ^2/2 and ΔP_z=ħ/√2 which corresponds to choice C).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Gp5k:\nThe state in the Pₓ eigenstate with eigenvalue -ħ is given in the P_z basis as (c₁,c₀,c₋₁)=(-1/2,1/√2,-1/2). The operator P_z has eigenvalues mħ with m=1,0,-1. Compute ⟨P_z⟩=Σ|c_m|²mħ = (1/4·1+1/2·0+1/4·(-1))ħ=0. Compute ⟨P_z²⟩=Σ|c_m|²m²ħ²=(1/4·1+1/2·0+1/4·1)ħ²=½ħ². Thus (ΔP_z)²=⟨P_z²⟩−⟨P_z⟩²=½ħ² so ΔP_z=ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zrGJ:\nThe state in the P_z basis is ψ = (–1/2, 1/√2, –1/2), normalized. The P_z eigenvalues are ħ, 0, –ħ. Compute ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)(–ħ) = 0. Compute ⟨P_z^2⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Thus ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ – ⟨P_z⟩^2) = ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:\nWe have a spin-1 system with basis eigenstates of P_z having eigenvalues ħ,0,−ħ. The given state in this basis is (−1/2,1/√2,−1/2), normalized. Compute ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(1/4−1/4)=0 and ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2(1/4+1/4)=ħ^2/2. Hence (ΔP_z)^2=ħ^2/2 and ΔP_z=ħ/√2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent cXsv:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Gp5k:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zrGJ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MGzN:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
