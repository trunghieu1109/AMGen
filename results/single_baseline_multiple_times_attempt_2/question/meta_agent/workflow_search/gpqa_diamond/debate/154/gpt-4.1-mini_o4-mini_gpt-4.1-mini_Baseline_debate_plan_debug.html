    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent cXsv:
We have a spin-1–like operator with P_z eigenvalues +ħ,0,−ħ and the state in that basis is (−1/2,1/√2,−1/2). First check normalization: |−1/2|^2+|1/√2|^2+|−1/2|^2=1/4+1/2+1/4=1. Expectation ⟨P_z⟩=∑|c_m|^2 mħ=(1/4·ħ+0+1/4·(−ħ))=0. Expectation ⟨P_z^2⟩=∑|c_m|^2(mħ)^2=(1/4·ħ^2+0+1/4·ħ^2)=ħ^2/2. Thus Var(P_z)=ħ^2/2 and ΔP_z=ħ/√2 which corresponds to choice C).

### thinking by Debate Agent Gp5k:
The state in the Pₓ eigenstate with eigenvalue -ħ is given in the P_z basis as (c₁,c₀,c₋₁)=(-1/2,1/√2,-1/2). The operator P_z has eigenvalues mħ with m=1,0,-1. Compute ⟨P_z⟩=Σ|c_m|²mħ = (1/4·1+1/2·0+1/4·(-1))ħ=0. Compute ⟨P_z²⟩=Σ|c_m|²m²ħ²=(1/4·1+1/2·0+1/4·1)ħ²=½ħ². Thus (ΔP_z)²=⟨P_z²⟩−⟨P_z⟩²=½ħ² so ΔP_z=ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent zrGJ:
The state in the P_z basis is ψ = (–1/2, 1/√2, –1/2), normalized. The P_z eigenvalues are ħ, 0, –ħ. Compute ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)(–ħ) = 0. Compute ⟨P_z^2⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Thus ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ – ⟨P_z⟩^2) = ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:
We have a spin-1 system with basis eigenstates of P_z having eigenvalues ħ,0,−ħ. The given state in this basis is (−1/2,1/√2,−1/2), normalized. Compute ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(1/4−1/4)=0 and ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2(1/4+1/4)=ħ^2/2. Hence (ΔP_z)^2=ħ^2/2 and ΔP_z=ħ/√2.
