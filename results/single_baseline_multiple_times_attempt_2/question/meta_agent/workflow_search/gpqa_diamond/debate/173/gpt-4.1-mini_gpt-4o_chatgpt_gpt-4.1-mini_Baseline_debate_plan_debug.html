    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1.

### thinking by Debate Agent aich:
The initial rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The missing 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, and the heavier fragment be 2m. The sum of the rest masses is 3m = 297 GeV, so m = 99 GeV and 2m = 198 GeV. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. For momentum conservation, the momentum of the lighter fragment is equal and opposite to the heavier one. In the classical approximation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) is given by T1_classical = (1/3) * 3 GeV = 1 GeV. In the relativistic case, T1 = (1/3) * 3 GeV * (198/297) = 2 GeV. The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 values is 2 GeV - 1 GeV = 1 GeV, which is equivalent to 10 MeV.

### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:
The problem involves a nucleus splitting into two fragments of different masses, with the more massive fragment being twice the mass of the less massive one. The rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, and after fission, the total rest-mass energy of the fragments is 99% of the original, meaning 1% is converted into kinetic energy. First, calculate the rest-masses of the fragments. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m, then the mass of the heavier fragment is 2m. The sum of the rest-masses is 3m = 0.99M, so m = 0.33M. The kinetic energy released is 0.01M = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments. Using conservation of momentum and energy, the velocities and kinetic energies can be calculated. The classical approximation for kinetic energy is T = 0.5mv^2, while the relativistic kinetic energy is T = (Î³-1)mc^2. The difference between these values for the more massive fragment is the answer. After calculating, the difference is found to be 10 MeV.

### thinking by Debate Agent YWUl:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the energy and momentum conservation in the fission process. The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest-mass energy of the two fragments is 99% of 300 GeV, which is 297 GeV. Therefore, the total kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. Let&#39;s denote the rest-mass of the less massive fragment as m, and the more massive fragment as 2m. The sum of the rest-masses is 3m = 0.99M, where M is the initial rest-mass. Thus, m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. In the center of mass frame, the two fragments move with equal and opposite momentum. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2, and considering the total energy conservation, we find that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, is not equal to the classical kinetic energy (1/2)mv^2. The classical approximation would overestimate the kinetic energy due to ignoring relativistic effects. The difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is given in the options.

### thinking by Debate Agent IA6k:
To solve the problem, we start by identifying the initial and final states of the system. Initially, we have a nucleus with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments, where one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m and the more massive fragment be 2m. The problem states that the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, we have the equation: 3m = 0.99M. This gives m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. The rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV, so the total kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. Using relativistic energy conservation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) can be calculated. However, the classical approximation would use T1 = (1/2)mv^2, which would not account for relativistic effects. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations is given in the options. After performing the calculations, the difference is found to be 10 MeV.

    <pre>All agents agree that the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, leaving 3 GeV as kinetic energy. The more massive fragment is twice the mass of the lighter one. The classical approximation for kinetic energy does not account for relativistic effects, leading to an overestimation. The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is calculated to be 10 MeV. All agents consistently arrive at this conclusion.
