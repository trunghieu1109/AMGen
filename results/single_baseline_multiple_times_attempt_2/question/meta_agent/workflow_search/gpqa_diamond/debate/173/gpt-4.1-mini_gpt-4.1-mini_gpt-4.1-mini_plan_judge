Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses in ratio 2:1, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the original mass, meaning 1% of the mass (3 GeV) is converted into kinetic energy. The heavier fragment has rest mass 0.66 M and the lighter 0.33 M. Using conservation of momentum and energy, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Calculations show that the momentum p is about 20 GeV/c. The classical kinetic energy for the heavier fragment is p^2/(2m) â‰ˆ 1.01 GeV, while the relativistic kinetic energy is about 0.99 GeV, giving a difference of about 20 MeV. Other estimates gave 5 MeV or 10 MeV, but the detailed calculation supports 20 MeV as the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy for the heavier fragment. Therefore, the best choice is 20 MeV, corresponding to choice D).
