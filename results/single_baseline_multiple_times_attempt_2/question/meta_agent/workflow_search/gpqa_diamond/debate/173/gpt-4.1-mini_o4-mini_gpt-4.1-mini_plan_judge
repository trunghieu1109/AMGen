Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Initial nucleus rest energy Mc²=300 GeV splits into fragments with m₁=2m₂ and m₁+m₂=0.99M ⇒ m₁c²=198 GeV, m₂c²=99 GeV. Mass defect ΔMc²=3 GeV becomes total kinetic energy Q. Non‐relativistically, T₁_cl=Q·m₂/(m₁+m₂)=3·(99/297)=1.000 GeV. Relativistically, momentum p satisfies √(p²+198²)+√(p²+99²)=300 GeV ⇒ p²≈399 GeV² ⇒ E₁=√(198²+p²)≈199.005 GeV ⇒ T₁=E₁−198≈1.005 GeV. Difference ≈1.005−1.000=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.
