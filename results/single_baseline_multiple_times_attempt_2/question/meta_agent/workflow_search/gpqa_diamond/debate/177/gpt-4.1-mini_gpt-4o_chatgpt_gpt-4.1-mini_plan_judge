Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we analyze the mass dimensions of the components in the Lagrangian. The fermion field \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} \), and the field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of 2. The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) has a mass dimension of 3, since \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless. Therefore, the interaction term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of 5. For the Lagrangian to have a mass dimension of 4, \( \kappa \) must have a mass dimension of \( -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension. Since \( \kappa \) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.
