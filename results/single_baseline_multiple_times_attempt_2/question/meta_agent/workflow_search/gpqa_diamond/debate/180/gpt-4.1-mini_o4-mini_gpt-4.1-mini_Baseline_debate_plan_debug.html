    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent q69j:
Band1 (700–800 keV) is dominated by CNO neutrinos (~10^7–10^8 cm^-2s^-1), band2 (800–900 keV) is overwhelmingly dominated by the monoenergetic 7Be line (~5×10^9 cm^-2s^-1). 8B neutrinos from pp-III are negligible in both. Removing pp-III thus doesn’t change the dominant contributions. The ratio is ~few×10^7/5×10^9 ≈10^-2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3IcK:
Neutrino sources in 700–900 keV: pp neutrinos cut off at 420 keV, only ^8B continuum contributes to 700–800 keV. At 800–900 keV there is both ^8B continuum and the strong 0.862 MeV ^7Be line. If the pp-III branch (the ^8B source) stops, the 700–800 keV band loses essentially all flux (numerator≈0), while 800–900 keV still sees the ^7Be line (denominator≈5×10^9 cm^–2 s^–1). Thus the flux ratio→0, so the only reasonable choice is the smallest nonzero option, 10^–2.

### thinking by Debate Agent NcUY:
Band1 (700–800 keV) gets only CNO neutrinos (≈5×10^8 cm⁻²s⁻¹ total, but only ≈7% falls in that 100 keV slice ≈3.5×10^7). Band2 (800–900 keV) gets the 7Be 862 keV line ≈4.3×10^9. Ratio ≈3.5×10^7/4.3×10^9≈8×10⁻³≈10⁻².

### thinking by Debate Agent eOCo:
Band 1 (700–800 keV) gets only CNO neutrino continuum once the pp-III (B-8) branch is shut off. Band 2 (800–900 keV) gets that same small CNO continuum plus the large Be-7 line at 861 keV. CNO flux in each 100 keV slice is ∼3×10^7 cm^-2 s^-1, while the Be-7 line contributes ∼5×10^9 cm^-2 s^-1 entirely in band 2. So flux1/flux2≈3×10^7/5×10^9≈6×10^-3, i.e. ∼10^-2.

    <pre>With the pp-III (⁸B) branch stopped, the 700–800 keV band is left only with the weak CNO continuum (≈3×10^7 cm⁻² s⁻¹), while the 800–900 keV band still has both that CNO continuum and the strong ⁷Be line at 861 keV (≈5×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹). The resulting ratio ≈3×10^7/5×10^9≈6×10⁻³, i.e. ≈10⁻².
