    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest, their temperatures are the same (since peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature by Wien&#39;s law). Luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and the same factor increase in mass, and both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest, this implies both have the same temperature (since peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature by Wien&#39;s law). Luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since temperatures are equal, luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio. Radius ratio is 1.5, so luminosity ratio = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Hence, Star_1&#39;s luminosity is greater than Star_2&#39;s by approximately 2.25 times.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
Given: Radius of Star_1 (R1) = 1.5 * Radius of Star_2 (R2), Mass of Star_1 = 1.5 * Mass of Star_2, and both stars have the same peak wavelength (implying same temperature, since peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature T by Wien&#39;s Law: λ_max * T = constant). Since temperatures are the same, T1 = T2. Luminosity L of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since T1 = T2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2)/(R2^2) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25. Checking the options, the closest is choice1: ~2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
Given that the stars have the same wavelength of peak emission, by Wien&#39;s law, they have the same temperature. Luminosity L of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities and mass do not affect the luminosity calculation here because temperature and radius determine luminosity. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

    <pre>The stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same temperature by Wien&#39;s law. Luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to the square of its radius times the fourth power of its temperature (L = 4πR^2σT^4). Since temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Given Star_1&#39;s radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, Star_1&#39;s luminosity is greater than Star_2&#39;s by a factor of approximately 2.25.
