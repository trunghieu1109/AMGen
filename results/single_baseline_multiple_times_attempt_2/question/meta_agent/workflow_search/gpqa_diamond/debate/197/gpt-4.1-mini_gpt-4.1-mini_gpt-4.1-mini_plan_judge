Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in a solution with total cobalt concentration 10^-2 M and SCN- concentration 0.1 M. The cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 are given. Using the formula for total cobalt concentration as the sum of free Co(II) and its complexes, and expressing each complex concentration in terms of free Co(II) concentration and SCN- concentration, we find the free Co(II) concentration by dividing the total cobalt concentration by the sum (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Calculating this sum gives approximately 2.3646, so free Co(II) concentration is about 0.00423 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is then β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%. This matches choice A).
