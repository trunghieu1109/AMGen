The distribution coefficient αn = βn[SCN–]^n / Σ_i βi[SCN–]^i with β0=1. Using [SCN–]=0.1 M: D = 1 + 9·0.1 + 40·0.01 + 63·0.001 + 16·0.0001 = 2.3646. The dithiocyanato term is 40·0.01 = 0.4. So α2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 = 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:\nWe use the overall stability constants βn for Co(SCN)n complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. With [SCN–]≈0.10 M, the fraction of Co in the dithiocyanato form (n=2) is α2 = β2[SCN–]2 / (1 + β1[SCN–] + β2[SCN–]2 + β3[SCN–]3 + β4[SCN–]4).\nPlugging in gives:\nβ1[SCN–] = 9×0.1 = 0.9\nβ2[SCN–]2 = 40×0.01 = 0.4\nβ3[SCN–]3 = 63×0.001 = 0.063\nβ4[SCN–]4 = 16×0.0001 = 0.0016\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nSo α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 = 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:\nWe have total [Co] = 1e-2 M and excess [SCN–] ≈ 0.1 M. The fraction of Co present as the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is\nfraction = β2[SCN–]2\n           / (1 + β1[SCN–] + β2[SCN–]2 + β3[SCN–]3 + β4[SCN–]4).\nWith β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 and [SCN–]=0.1 M:\nDenominator = 1 + 9·0.1 + 40·0.01 + 63·0.001 + 16·0.0001 = 2.3646\nNumerator = 40·0.01 = 0.4\nFraction = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92% ≈ 16.9%\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent UD2w:\nWe have total cobalt c(Co)=10^-2 M and [SCN-]≈0.1 M. Complex formation constants: β1=9; β2=40; β3=63; β4=16. Fraction of Co(SCN)2 (blue dithiocyanato) is α2=β2[SCN]^2/(1+β1[SCN]+β2[SCN]^2+β3[SCN]^3+β4[SCN]^4). Compute terms: 1; 9×0.1=0.9; 40×0.1^2=0.4; 63×0.1^3=0.063; 16×0.1^4=0.0016. Sum=2.3646; α2=0.4/2.3646≈0.1692=16.9%.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent E6Fv:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eJow:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xVo6:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent UD2w:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
