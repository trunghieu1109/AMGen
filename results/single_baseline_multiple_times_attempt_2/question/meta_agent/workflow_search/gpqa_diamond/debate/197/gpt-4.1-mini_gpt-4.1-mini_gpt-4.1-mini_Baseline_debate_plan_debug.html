### thinking by Debate Agent E6Fv:
Given: c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes. We want the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which corresponds to the species with two SCN- ligands: Co(SCN)2^0 or Co(SCN)2^2-. The stability constants βn are cumulative: β1 = [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN-], β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/[Co][SCN-]^2, etc. We can express the fraction of each species in terms of free Co(II) concentration and SCN- concentration using β values.

Let [Co]_total = 10^-2 M.
Let [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Species:
- Co^2+ (free)
- Co(SCN)+
- Co(SCN)2
- Co(SCN)3-
- Co(SCN)4^2-

Using β values:
[Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]
[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2
[Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3
[Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4

Sum of all species = [Co]_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]

Substitute:
[Co]_total = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)

Calculate each term:
β1*[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
β2*[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4
β3*[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063
β4*[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum inside parentheses = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

Therefore,
[Co^2+] = [Co]_total / 2.3646 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Now calculate [Co(SCN)2]:
[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.0000423 = 0.001692 M

Calculate total Co species concentration to verify:
Sum = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]
= 0.00423 + (9*0.00423*0.1) + 0.001692 + (63*0.00423*0.001) + (16*0.00423*0.0001)
= 0.00423 + 0.00381 + 0.001692 + 0.000266 + 0.000007
= approx 0.009995 M (close to 0.01 M)

Percentage of Co(SCN)2 complex = ([Co(SCN)2] / [Co]_total) * 100 = (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%

Comparing to choices, closest is 16.9%.

### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:
We have a solution with total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (cumulative) for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. These correspond to the equilibria: Co + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN), β1=9; Co + 2SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2, β2=40; Co + 3SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)3, β3=63; Co + 4SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)4, β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. To find this, we calculate the concentration fractions of each species using the stepwise or cumulative constants and the free SCN- concentration (approx 0.1 M). The fraction of Co(SCN)2 is given by: fraction(Co(SCN)2) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Calculate numerator and denominator: β1[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9; β2[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4; β3[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063; β4[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016. Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Fraction Co(SCN)2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.

### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:
First, identify the species and their stability constants: β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16 correspond to stepwise or overall stability constants for Co(II) complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-). Typically, βn represents the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)n^(2-n). Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we want the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the species with two SCN- ligands, i.e., Co(SCN)2. The fraction is given by the concentration of Co(SCN)2 divided by the total cobalt concentration. The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of βn and [SCN-]^n: [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN-]^n. The total cobalt concentration c(Co) = [Co^{2+}] + Σ[Co(SCN)n] for n=1 to 4 = [Co^{2+}] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). We can solve for [Co^{2+}]: [Co^{2+}] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Calculate the denominator: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Then, [Co^{2+}] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all Co species is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%.

### thinking by Debate Agent UD2w:
We have Co(II) ions with total concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and SCN- concentration = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes Co(SCN)n^2-n are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. These constants represent cumulative formation constants: β1 = [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN], β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/[Co][SCN]^2, etc. We want the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt species.

Step 1: Calculate the concentration ratios of each complex relative to free Co(II) using:
[Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co][SCN]^n

Step 2: Let [Co] = x (free Co(II) concentration). Then:
[Co(SCN)] = β1 * x * (0.1)^1 = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x
[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x
[Co(SCN)3] = β3 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x
[Co(SCN)4] = β4 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x

Step 3: Total Co concentration is sum of all species:
10^-2 = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x * 2.3646

Step 4: Solve for x:
x = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Step 5: Calculate [Co(SCN)2]:
[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M

Step 6: Percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species:
(0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%

Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.

    <pre>The problem involves calculating the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in a solution with total cobalt concentration 10^-2 M and SCN- concentration 0.1 M. The cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 are given. Using the formula for total cobalt concentration as the sum of free Co(II) and its complexes, and expressing each complex concentration in terms of free Co(II) concentration and SCN- concentration, we find the free Co(II) concentration by dividing the total cobalt concentration by the sum (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Calculating this sum gives approximately 2.3646, so free Co(II) concentration is about 0.00423 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is then β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%. This matches choice A).
