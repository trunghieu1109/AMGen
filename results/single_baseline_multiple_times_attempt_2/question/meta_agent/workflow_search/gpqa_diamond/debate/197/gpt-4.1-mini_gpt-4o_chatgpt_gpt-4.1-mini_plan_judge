Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, we need to calculate its concentration using the stability constant β2 and compare it to the total concentration of all cobalt species. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is calculated as [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all complexes: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%. All agents calculated this and concluded that the percentage corresponds to choice B) 42.3%.
