    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 6Fve:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 using the given stability constant β2. We start by calculating the concentrations of all cobalt species using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The expression for β2 is [Co(SCN)2]/([Co][SCN-]^2) = 40. We calculate [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co][SCN-]^2. Similarly, we calculate the concentrations for all other cobalt species using their respective stability constants. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%.

### thinking by Debate Agent Jowx:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the stability constants for each complex. The concentration of each complex can be calculated using the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes follows these equilibria: Co + SCN- &lt;-&gt; Co(SCN), Co + 2SCN- &lt;-&gt; Co(SCN)2, etc. The concentration of each complex is given by: [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co] * [SCN-]^n. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co]total = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. We calculate each term and then find the fraction of [Co(SCN)2] over [Co]total. Given β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16, [Co] = 10^-2 M, and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we calculate: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 10^-2 * (0.1)^2. Similarly, calculate other complexes and sum to find [Co]total. Finally, find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2] by dividing by [Co]total and multiplying by 100. This results in the percentage corresponding to one of the given choices.

### thinking by Debate Agent Vo6U:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, we need to calculate the concentration of this complex and compare it to the total concentration of all cobalt species. The formation of Co(SCN)2 is described by the second stability constant β2, which is 40. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the formula: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We first need to determine the concentration of free Co2+ ions and then find the concentration of Co(SCN)2. Finally, the percentage is calculated as: (concentration of Co(SCN)2 / total concentration of Co species) * 100%.

### thinking by Debate Agent D2wx:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of each cobalt complex using the stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The total concentration of cobalt is given as c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants indicate the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes relative to the free ions. We can set up the equilibrium expressions for each complex: [Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co2+] * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^3, and [Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^4. Calculate the concentration of each complex and then find the percentage of Co(SCN)2 among the total cobalt species.

    <pre>All agents agree that to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, we need to calculate its concentration using the stability constant β2 and compare it to the total concentration of all cobalt species. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is calculated as [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all complexes: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%. All agents calculated this and concluded that the percentage corresponds to choice B) 42.3%.
