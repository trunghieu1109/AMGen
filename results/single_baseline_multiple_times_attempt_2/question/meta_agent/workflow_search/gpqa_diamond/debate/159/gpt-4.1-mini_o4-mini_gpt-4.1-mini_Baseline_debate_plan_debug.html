    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 755K:
For N→∞ the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. The diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with minima at 2πaθ/λ = zeros of J1: α1=3.8317, α2=7.0156. Thus θ1=α1λ/(2πa)=0.610λ/a, θ2=α2λ/(2πa)=1.116λ/a, and their separation Δθ=θ2−θ1=0.506λ/a.

### thinking by Debate Agent ERnq:
As N→∞ the N‐gon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far‐field pattern is the Airy pattern with zeros at kaθ=αn (α1≈3.832, α2≈7.016) and k=2π/λ. Thus θ1=α1/(ka)=0.61λ/a, θ2=α2/(ka)=1.12λ/a, so Δθ=θ2−θ1≈(7.016−3.832)/(2π)*(λ/a)=0.506λ/a.

### thinking by Debate Agent ckaO:
As N→∞ the aperture becomes circular with diameter D=2a. The Airy pattern minima occur at angles θ_n = x_n λ/D, where x_1≈1.22, x_2≈2.23. The angular separation between the first two minima is Δθ = (x_2−x_1) λ/D = (2.23−1.22)λ/(2a) ≈1.01λ/(2a) ≈0.505λ/a ≈0.506λ/a.

### thinking by Debate Agent iWQ8:
As N→∞ the polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The minima occur where k a sinθ = j1,m (zeros of J1), with j1,1≈3.8317 and j1,2≈7.0156 and k=2π/λ. Hence θ1=j1,1λ/(2πa)≈0.610λ/a and θ2=j1,2λ/(2πa)≈1.1166λ/a. The angular separation is θ2−θ1=(j1,2−j1,1)λ/(2πa)≈0.506λ/a, matching choice D).
