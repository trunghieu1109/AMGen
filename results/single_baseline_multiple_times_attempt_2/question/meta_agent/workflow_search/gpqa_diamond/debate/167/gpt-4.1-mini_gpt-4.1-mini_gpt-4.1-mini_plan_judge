Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks for the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis among four issues: mutually incompatible data formats, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. While all these issues can cause errors, mutually incompatible data formats usually cause more obvious errors that are easier to detect early. The other three issues ('chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion) are more subtle and often lead to silent, difficult-to-spot errors. Therefore, the most accurate answer is the one that includes issues 2, 3, and 4 but excludes 1. This corresponds to choice 4.
