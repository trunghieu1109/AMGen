Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks for the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. Each agent has evaluated the issues: mutually incompatible data formats, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. While mutually incompatible data formats can cause errors, they are often easier to detect. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are all common and can lead to subtle errors that are difficult to spot. Most agents agree that these three issues (2, 3, and 4) are particularly problematic, aligning with choice D. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is D) 2, 3 and 4.
