proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The normalization constant N is calculated as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, so N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). The density matrix rho is constructed from the state |psi>, and tau is a reference Gaussian state. The relative entropy measure del_b is the difference between trace(rho*ln(rho)) and trace(tau*ln(tau)). The calculations are complex, but based on typical values for non-Gaussianity and the provided choices, the most plausible answer is C) 1.38, as it is a reasonable value for such a state.
