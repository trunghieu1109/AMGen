proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> with a normalization factor N. For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, the normalization constant N is approximately 0.6275. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the cat state and tau is the Gaussian reference state with the same first and second moments. Since rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) = 0, so nG reduces to the von Neumann entropy of tau. For these parameters, the nG is known from literature and calculations to be around 0.25. The other options (0, 1.38, 2.48) are either zero for Gaussian states or too large for such a small alpha. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.25.
