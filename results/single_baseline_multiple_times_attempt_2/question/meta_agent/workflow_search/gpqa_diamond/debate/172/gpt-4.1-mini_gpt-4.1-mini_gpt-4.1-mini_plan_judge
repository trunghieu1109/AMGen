Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents used Heisenberg's uncertainty principle Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 to find the uncertainty in momentum Δp, then used the relation ΔE ≈ v * Δp to estimate the uncertainty in energy ΔE. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^-10 m, ħ ≈ 1.055 × 10^-34 Js, and electron speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s, the calculation yields Δp ≈ 5.275 × 10^-25 kg·m/s and ΔE ≈ 1.055 × 10^-16 J. This corresponds to choice3: ~10^(-16) J. All agents agree on this result, confirming the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately 10^-16 J.
