Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents used the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to calculate the uncertainty in momentum Δp using Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. They then calculated the uncertainty in energy ΔE using ΔE = Δp * v, where v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. The calculations consistently resulted in ΔE ≈ 1.05 × 10^(-16) J, which corresponds to choice C) ~10^(-16) J. Therefore, the final answer is C).
