Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The spin state is given as (3i, 4). First, normalize the state vector: norm = sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5. The normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator along y-direction is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Calculate σ_y |ψ>: σ_y * (3i/5, 4/5)^T = (-4i/5, -3/5)^T. The conjugate transpose of |ψ> is (-3i/5, 4/5). Compute <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5) = (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25. Therefore, <S_y> = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. This matches choice 2: '-12*hbar/25'.
