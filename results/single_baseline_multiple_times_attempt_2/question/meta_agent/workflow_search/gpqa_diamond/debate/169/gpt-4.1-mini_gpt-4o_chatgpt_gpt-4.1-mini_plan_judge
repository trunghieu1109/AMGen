Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, we use the formula <ψ|σ_y|ψ>, where |ψ> is the spin state and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. The given spin state is (3i, 4), which can be represented as a column vector: |ψ> = (3i, 4). The σ_y matrix is given as: \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}. The expectation value is calculated as <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = (3i, 4)† * σ_y * (3i, 4), where † denotes the conjugate transpose. First, calculate the conjugate transpose of |ψ>: (3i, 4)† = (-3i, 4). Then, compute σ_y|ψ>: σ_y * (3i, 4) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}. Next, calculate <ψ|σ_y|ψ>: (-3i, 4) * \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(3) = 12 + 12 = 24. The expectation value of S_y is (24 * ħ)/2 = 12ħ. However, the options provided must be checked for consistency with units and coefficients. The correct choice is 12*hbar/25. This matches the reasoning of Debate Agent 0Ypb and YkWQ, who both concluded that the correct answer is C) 12*hbar/25.
