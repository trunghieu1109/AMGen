    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FXLU:
The radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid with its symmetry axis along z is that of an electric dipole along z. The angular dependence of radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2θ, which peaks at θ=90°. At θ=30°, the fraction is sin^2(30°)=1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4∝(1/λ)^4. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ^(−4), corresponding to choice 3, i.e. C).

### thinking by Debate Agent qrA9:
The spheroidal charge oscillates along z, acting as an electric dipole. The angular distribution of dipole radiation is ∝sin^2θ, peaking at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4. The frequency dependence of dipole radiation power is ∝ω^4∝λ^{-4}. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ^{-4}, corresponding to choice 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent S6HI:
The radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution with a net dipole moment is that of an electric dipole: power per unit solid angle ∝ sin^2θ. The maximum occurs at θ=90°; at θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum. The frequency dependence comes from the second time derivative of the dipole moment: p̈^2 ∝ ω^4 ∝ (2πc/λ)^4 ∝ λ^{-4}. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the dependence is λ^{-4}, corresponding to choice 3, i.e. C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9lWX:
An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry axis along z acts as an electric dipole. Its angular radiation pattern is ∝sin²θ, which peaks at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4, so the radiated power is 1/4 of the maximum. The frequency dependence for dipole radiation is ∝ω⁴∝(1/λ)⁴, so f∝λ⁻⁴. Hence the correct choice is 1/4 and λ⁻⁴, i.e., choice3, corresponding to C).

    <pre>An oscillating spheroidal charge with symmetry axis along z behaves like an electric dipole. Its angular distribution is proportional to sin^2θ, giving sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4 ∼ λ^(−4). Hence the correct choice is 1/4 and λ^(−4), i.e. choice 3 corresponding to C).
