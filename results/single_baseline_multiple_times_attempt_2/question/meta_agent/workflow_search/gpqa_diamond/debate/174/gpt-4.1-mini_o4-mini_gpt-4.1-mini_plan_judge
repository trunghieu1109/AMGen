Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: An oscillating spheroidal charge with symmetry axis along z behaves like an electric dipole. Its angular distribution is proportional to sin^2θ, giving sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4 ∼ λ^(−4). Hence the correct choice is 1/4 and λ^(−4), i.e. choice 3 corresponding to C).
