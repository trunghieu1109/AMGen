Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution in the shape of a spheroid, which radiates power depending on the angle \theta with respect to the z-axis. The power pattern is typically proportional to \sin^2(\theta), which means at \theta = 30^0, the fraction of maximum power radiated is \sin^2(30^0) = 1/4. The wavelength dependence for such radiation is often \lambda^(-4), characteristic of dipole radiation. All agents agree on these points, and the choice that matches is 1/4, \lambda^(-4).
