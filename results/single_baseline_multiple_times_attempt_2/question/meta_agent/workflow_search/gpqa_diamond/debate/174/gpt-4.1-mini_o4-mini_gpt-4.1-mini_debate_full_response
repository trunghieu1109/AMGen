Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 0UjO', content='An oscillating spheroidal charge with symmetry axis along z behaves like an electric dipole. Its angular distribution is proportional to sin^2θ, giving sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4 ∼ λ^(−4).

The angular dependence of radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2θ, which peaks at θ=90°. At θ=30°, the fraction is sin^2(30°)=1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4∝(1/λ)^4. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ^(−4), corresponding to choice 3, i.e. C).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent qrA9:\nThe spheroidal charge oscillates along z, acting as an electric dipole. The angular distribution of dipole radiation is ∝sin^2θ, peaking at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4. The frequency dependence of dipole radiation power is ∝ω^4∝λ^{-4}. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ^{-4}, corresponding to choice 3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent S6HI:\nThe radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution with a net dipole moment is that of an electric dipole: power per unit solid angle ∝ sin^2θ. The maximum occurs at θ=90°; at θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum. The frequency dependence comes from the second time derivative of the dipole moment: p̈^2 ∝ ω^4 ∝ (2πc/λ)^4 ∝ λ^{-4}. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the dependence is λ^{-4}, corresponding to choice 3, i.e. C).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 9lWX:\nAn oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry axis along z acts as an electric dipole. Its angular radiation pattern is ∝sin²θ, which peaks at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4, so the radiated power is 1/4 of the maximum. The frequency dependence for dipole radiation is ∝ω⁴∝(1/λ)⁴, so f∝λ⁻⁴. Hence the correct choice is 1/4 and λ⁻⁴, i.e., choice3, corresponding to C).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FXLU:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent qrA9:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent S6HI:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9lWX:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
