Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We first derive the inclination from the known impact parameter b1=(a1/R*) cos i=0.2 for P1=3 d around a 1.5 R⊙ star. Kepler’s law gives a1/R*≈5.85, so cos i≈0.2/5.85≈0.034. For the second planet to both transit and be occulted, its impact parameter b2=(a2/R*) cos i must satisfy b2≤1+Rp2/R*. With Rp2/R*≈0.0153, (1+Rp2/R*)/cos i≈29.2 so a2/a1≈29.2/5.85≈5.0. Then P2=P1·(a2/a1)^{3/2}≈3·5^{3/2}≈33.5 d, corresponding to choice B).
