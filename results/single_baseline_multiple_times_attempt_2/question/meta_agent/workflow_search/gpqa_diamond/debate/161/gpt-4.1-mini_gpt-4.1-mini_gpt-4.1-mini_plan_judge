proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), which is conformal to the Euclidean metric with conformal factor 32 / (4 - r^2), where r^2 = x^2 + y^2. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we integrate the area element dA = (32 / (4 - r^2)) dx dy over the disk of radius 2. Converting to polar coordinates, the area integral becomes ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^{2} (32 / (4 - r^2)) r dr dθ. The angular integral is 2π, and the radial integral is ∫_0^{2} (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr. Using substitution u = 4 - r^2, the integral transforms to 16 ∫_0^{4} (1/u) du, which diverges logarithmically at u=0 (r=2). Therefore, the area integral diverges to infinity. Hence, the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 under this metric is infinite.
