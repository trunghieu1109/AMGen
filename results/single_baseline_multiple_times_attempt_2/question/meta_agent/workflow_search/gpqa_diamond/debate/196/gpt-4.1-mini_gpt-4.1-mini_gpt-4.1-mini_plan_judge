Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows a broad peak at 3400-2500 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group in the starting compound. The 1H NMR data supports a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to the corresponding alkyl benzenes by removing the COOH group. Therefore, the final product should be an alkylbenzene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group para to each other. Among the choices, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene fits this description. Hence, the final product is choice A).
