Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the mass ratio of the two binary systems, we use the mass function, which is proportional to the product of the period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the period is 2 years and the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a mass function proportional to 2 * (10 + 5)^3 = 2 * 15^3 = 6750. For system_2, the period is 1 year and the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a mass function proportional to 1 * (15 + 10)^3 = 1 * 25^3 = 15625. The ratio of the mass functions is 6750 / 15625 â‰ˆ 0.432, which is closest to the choice ~0.4. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
