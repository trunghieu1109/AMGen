Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The total mass of a binary star system can be estimated using Kepler's third law combined with the radial velocity amplitudes. The total mass M_total is proportional to the orbital period P multiplied by the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2)^3, assuming similar inclination and circular orbits. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s, so (K1_1 + K2_1) = 15 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s, so (K1_2 + K2_2) = 25 km/s. The ratio of total masses is M1/M2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3) / (P2 * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3) = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3) = (2 * 3375) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 â‰ˆ 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive by a factor of approximately 0.4.
