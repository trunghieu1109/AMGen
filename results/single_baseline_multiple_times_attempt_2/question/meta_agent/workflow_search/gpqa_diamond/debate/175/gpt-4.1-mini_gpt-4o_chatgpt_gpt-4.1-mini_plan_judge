Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the probability of sequential measurements of two observables P and Q on a given state. The key steps involve finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operators P and Q, projecting the initial state onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P, and then projecting the resulting state onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 of Q. The probability is the product of the probabilities of these projections. After reviewing the calculations and the reasoning provided by the agents, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is found to be 1/6, which corresponds to choice B).
