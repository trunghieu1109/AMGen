The IR shows a broad O–H (3500–2700 cm^-1) and a carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR has a COOH singlet at 11 ppm (1H) and an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern (two doublets, each 2H), indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Para-chlorobenzoic acid fits all data (MW ~156; one Cl; carboxylic acid; symmetric aromatic protons).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Vr9h:\nMass spec: M=156 with M+2 at 158 (~32%) indicates one Cl. IR: broad 3500–2700 cm–1 plus sharp 1720 cm–1 indicates a carboxylic acid. 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is COOH; two doublets integrating to 2H each show an AA′BB′ system, i.e. a para-disubstituted benzene. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid fits all data.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2cpG:\nThe mass spec shows M+ at 156 and M+2 at 158 (32%), indicating one Cl atom. IR has broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ and strong C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carboxylic acid. 1H NMR shows 11.0 ppm (1H, s) for COOH and two doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid fits all data (C7H5ClO2, MW 156).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Kygp:\nThe molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 (32%) indicates one chlorine atom. IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ O–H stretch and a strong 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR has an 11 ppm singlet (–COOH) and two aromatic doublets (2H each), indicating a para-substituted benzene. Thus the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DQVo:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Vr9h:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2cpG:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Kygp:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
