Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in two stars under LTE, which follows the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in the excited state is given by the exponential of the negative energy difference over kT. Given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we set up the ratio and take the natural logarithm, leading to ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Rearranging this gives ln(2) proportional to (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Among the given options, only choice 4 matches this form exactly.
