Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves the excitation of iron atoms in two stars and the energy difference between the levels, implying a Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of excited states in thermal equilibrium follows the Boltzmann factor: n_1/n_2 = exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. Given that star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2, we have n_1/n_2 = 2. This implies 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). Taking the natural logarithm, ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1). We need to match this with the given choices, which are likely simplified forms of this expression. The choice that matches this form is choice 4: ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)].
