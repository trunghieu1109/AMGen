    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent CSzE:
We use the Boltzmann excitation law: the relative population of an excited level is proportional to exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The ratio of excited populations in star 1 versus star 2 is 2, so

2 = exp(−ΔE/(kT1)) / exp(−ΔE/(kT2)) = exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 − 1/T1)].

Taking logs: ln 2 = ΔE/k (1/T2 − 1/T1). Given ΔE ≃ 1.38×10^−23 J and k = 1.38×10^−23 J/K, ΔE/k = 1 K, so

ln 2 = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2),

which is choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent bTcQ:
Under LTE Boltzmann equilibrium, the excited‐level population scales as exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The ratio of excited populations between star 1 and star 2 is 2=exp[ΔE(1/(kT2)−1/(kT1))]. With ΔE=1.38×10^−23 J=k, ΔE/k=1, giving ln2=(T1−T2)/(T1 T2). That matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent KWrQ:
Under LTE, the fraction in the excited level f∝exp(−ΔE/kT). So
f1/f2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)]=2 ⇒ ln2=ΔE/k·(1/T2−1/T1)=ΔE/k·(T1−T2)/(T1T2).
Thus the temperature relation has the form ln(2)=(T1−T2)/(T1 T2), matching choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent mGv8:
Under LTE, the Boltzmann ratio gives N_j1/N_j2 = exp[–ΔE/kT1]/exp[–ΔE/kT2] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2–1/T1)] = 2. Taking the log yields ln2 = (ΔE/k)(T1–T2)/(T1T2). Ignoring the constant factor matches choice D.

    <pre>Under LTE the population ratio between the excited levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: N1/N2 = exp(–ΔE/kT1)/exp(–ΔE/kT2) = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 – 1/T1)]. Given that N1/N2 = 2 and ΔE/k = (1.38×10^–23 J)/(1.38×10^–23 J/K) = 1, we get ln 2 = (1/T2 – 1/T1) = (T1 – T2)/(T1 T2), which corresponds to choice D).
