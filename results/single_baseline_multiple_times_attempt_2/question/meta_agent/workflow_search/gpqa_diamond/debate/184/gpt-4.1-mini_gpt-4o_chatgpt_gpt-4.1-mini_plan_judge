Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε \vec{σ}.\vec{n}, where \vec{σ} are the Pauli matrices and \vec{n} is a unit vector. The operator \vec{σ}.\vec{n} is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices and has eigenvalues of ±1 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1 and \vec{n} is a unit vector. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H are ε times the eigenvalues of \vec{σ}.\vec{n}, which are ±ε. This matches choice A).
