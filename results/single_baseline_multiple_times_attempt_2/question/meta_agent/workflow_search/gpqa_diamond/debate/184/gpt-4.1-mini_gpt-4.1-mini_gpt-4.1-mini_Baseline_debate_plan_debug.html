### thinking by Debate Agent OfZu:
The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 operators and the dot product with a unit vector just projects spin along that direction. Since H = ε (σ · n), the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n, which are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are +ε and -ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:
The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 operators and σ · n corresponds to the spin operator along direction n, which has eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. The factor of ħ/2 is not present here because the Hamiltonian is given directly as ε times σ · n, not including ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:
The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 operators and the dot product with a unit vector just projects the spin operator along that direction. Multiplying by ε scales the eigenvalues by ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. The factor of ħ/2 is not present here because the Hamiltonian is defined directly as ε times σ · n, not involving the spin operator S = (ħ/2) σ. Hence, the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:
The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 along any direction n. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n, which are ±ε. The factor of ħ/2 does not appear here because the Hamiltonian is directly given as ε times σ · n, not multiplied by ħ/2. Hence, the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.
