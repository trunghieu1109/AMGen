Since σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 (σ·n squared = I and Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1), the eigenvalues of H are ε*(±1) = ±ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:\nThe Hamiltonian H = ε σ⋅n has eigenvalues equal to ε times the eigenvalues of σ⋅n. Since σ⋅n is a Pauli matrix in some direction, its eigenvalues are ±1. Therefore H has eigenvalues ±ε, which corresponds to choice A).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:\nThe Hamiltonian is H=ε\u2009σ·n. The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 since σ are Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Therefore H has eigenvalues ε·(±1)=±ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:\nThe Hamiltonian H = ε σ·n. Since σ·n is a Pauli matrix along some axis, its eigenvalues are ±1. Multiplying by ε gives eigenvalues ±ε.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent OfZu:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 7Dc4:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Mrcx:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent jHjk:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
