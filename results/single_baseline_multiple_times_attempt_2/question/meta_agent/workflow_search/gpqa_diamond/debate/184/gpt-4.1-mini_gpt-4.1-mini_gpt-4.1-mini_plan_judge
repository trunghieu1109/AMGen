proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 operators and the dot product with a unit vector projects the spin operator along that direction. Multiplying by ε scales these eigenvalues by ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. The factor of ħ/2 is not included in the Hamiltonian, so eigenvalues involving ħ/2 are incorrect.
