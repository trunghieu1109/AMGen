Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA forms epoxides. The stereochemistry of the alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide. (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, which is a meso compound (achiral), while (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Thus, the product mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso epoxide and two enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers co-elute, so the pair of enantiomers appears as one peak, and the meso epoxide appears as another peak, totaling two peaks. On a chiral HPLC, enantiomers are separated, so the pair of enantiomers gives two peaks, plus the meso epoxide peak, totaling three peaks. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks on standard HPLC and 3 peaks on chiral HPLC.
