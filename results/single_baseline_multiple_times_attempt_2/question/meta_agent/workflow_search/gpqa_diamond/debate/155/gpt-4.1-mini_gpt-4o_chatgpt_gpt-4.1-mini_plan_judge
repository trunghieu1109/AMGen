Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reactions involve epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene followed by hydrolysis to form diols. The (E)-alkene forms a trans-diol, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. The (Z)-alkene forms a cis-diol, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC, the meso compound and the racemic mixture of enantiomers will result in two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic mixture. On a chiral HPLC, the meso compound will still result in one peak, but the enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks, resulting in three peaks in total. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
