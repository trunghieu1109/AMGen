    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent xMjR:
Epoxidation of E-oct-4-ene gives the trans epoxide (racemic, 2 enantiomers). Epoxidation of Z-oct-4-ene gives the cis epoxide (meso, achiral, 1 isomer). Standard (achiral) HPLC sees diastereomers only: cis vs trans (racemate co-elutes) → 2 peaks. Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers of the trans isomer into 2 peaks plus the meso cis as 1 peak → 3 peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent xKiP:
The epoxidation of E-oct-4-ene gives the trans-epoxide (which is chiral) but since the alkene is symmetrical it forms a racemic mixture. The Z-alkene gives the cis-epoxide, which with identical substituents is meso. Acid opening (anti addition) yields trans-diols: anti addition to trans-alkene gives a meso diol, while anti addition to cis-alkene gives a racemic diol. Mixing both reactions gives one meso diol + two enantiomers. On an achiral column enantiomers coelute (2 peaks: meso vs racemate). On a chiral column all three separate (3 peaks).

### thinking by Debate Agent vDzD:
Epoxidation of an achiral trans‐alkene gives a racemic epoxide, then anti‐opening yields a racemic anti‐diol (R,R + S,S). Epoxidation of the cis‐alkene gives a meso epoxide, which yields the meso diol (achiral). Combining gives two diastereomers: the racemic pair (co‐eluting on achiral column) and the meso. Thus on achiral HPLC: 2 peaks (meso + racemate coelute). On a chiral column: the enantiomers of the racemate separate, plus the meso diol, for 3 peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent RtOd:
Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives a racemic trans-epoxide (two enantiomers), whereas (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a single meso cis-epoxide. Acid opening yields corresponding diols: a racemic pair (two enantiomers) plus one meso diol (achiral). On achiral HPLC, enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso vs racemate). On chiral HPLC, the two enantiomers separate, yielding three peaks.

    <pre>Epoxidation of E‐oct‐4‐ene gives the trans epoxide, which (because substituents differ) is meso → after acid opening it gives a single meso diol. Epoxidation of Z‐oct‐4‐ene gives the cis epoxide as a racemic pair → after opening it gives a racemic (enantiomeric) diol pair. On an achiral column the two enantiomers coelute, so meso vs racemate gives 2 peaks. On a chiral column the racemate splits into 2 plus the meso gives a third peak → 3 peaks total.
