Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are all (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken symmetries (spin-rotation, chiral, and translational respectively), whereas skyrmions are topological solitons not tied to a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
