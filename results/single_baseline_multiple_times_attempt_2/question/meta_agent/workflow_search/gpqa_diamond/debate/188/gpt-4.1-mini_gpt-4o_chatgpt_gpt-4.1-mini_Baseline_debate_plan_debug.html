### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of spins in a lattice, typically related to broken spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton typically associated with certain configurations in field theories and can be related to broken symmetries in certain contexts. A pion is a particle associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quasiparticle representing quantized sound waves or lattice vibrations and is generally not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same sense as the others.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
To determine which of the listed particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option: 

- A) Magnon: This is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation in a lattice of spins, typically found in magnetic systems. Magnons are indeed associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, specifically the breaking of rotational symmetry in spin space.

- B) Skyrmion: This is a topological soliton that can occur in magnetic systems and is related to the breaking of certain symmetries. However, Skyrmions are not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries in the same sense as the other particles listed.

- C) Pion: Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are considered Goldstone bosons of the broken symmetry.

- D) Phonon: Phonons are quasiparticles that represent quantized modes of vibrations within a crystal lattice. They are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal.

Given this analysis, Skyrmions are the least directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries compared to the other options.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to understand the context of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electrons&#39; spin in a lattice, related to the breaking of rotational symmetry in magnetic systems. A skyrmion is a topological soliton in a field theory, often arising in magnetic systems with broken symmetry. A pion is a meson associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, related to translational symmetry but not necessarily a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is likely the phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is associated with spin waves in a lattice, often related to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnets. A skyrmion is a topological soliton often found in magnetic systems, and its connection to symmetry breaking is not as direct as other particles. A pion is a Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, typically associated with the breaking of translational symmetry. Among these, the skyrmion is the least directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

A phonon is associated with lattice vibrations and is related to translational symmetry, but it is not typically considered a result of spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same sense as the others. The debate agents are split between skyrmions and phonons, but phonons are generally not considered to arise from spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as magnons and pions. Therefore, the phonon is the least associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.
