Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes from a broken continuous symmetry.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:\nMagnons are Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotational symmetry in magnets. Pions are Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:\nMagnons are Goldstone modes from broken spin-rotation symmetry. Phonons are Goldstone modes from broken translational symmetry in crystals. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:\nWe examine each effective particle: 1) Magnon: Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. 2) Pion: (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. 3) Phonon: Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. 4) Skyrmion: a topological soliton, not arising as the Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken symmetry. Therefore the correct choice is Skyrmion.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ctX7:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent g2dS:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent bA1y:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5SLk:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
