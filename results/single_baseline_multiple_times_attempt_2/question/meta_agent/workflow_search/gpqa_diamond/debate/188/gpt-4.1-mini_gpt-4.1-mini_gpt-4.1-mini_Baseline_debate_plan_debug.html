### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective spin wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system, which arise due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons representing stable, particle-like configurations in certain field theories or magnetic systems; although they emerge from nontrivial topology and interactions, they are not themselves Nambu-Goldstone modes arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Therefore, Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective spin wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system, arising from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are the (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and can be considered as arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone bosons or quasiparticles directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetries; they are stable field configurations characterized by topological properties, not by symmetry breaking per se. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnets. Pions are Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and not Goldstone bosons; they are not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry but rather with topological properties of the field configuration. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

    <pre>Magnons, pions, and phonons are all associated with spontaneously broken symmetries: magnons with spin rotational symmetry, pions with chiral symmetry, and phonons with translational symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and not Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. They represent stable topological configurations rather than excitations due to broken symmetries. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
