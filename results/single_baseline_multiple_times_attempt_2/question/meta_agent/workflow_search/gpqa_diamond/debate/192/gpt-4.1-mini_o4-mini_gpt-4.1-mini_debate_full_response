Thus N(r)dr = N(p)|dp/dr|dr = (1/p^5)(1/r^2)dr = (r^5)(1/r^2)dr = r^3 dr.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:\nParallax p∝1/r so N(p)∝1/p^5∝r^5. But N(r)dr=N(p)dp so N(r)=N(p)|dp/dr|. Since p∝r⁻¹, dp/dr∝r⁻². Thus N(r)∝r^5·r⁻²=r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:\nSince parallax plx ∝ 1/r, N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 ∝ r^5. The conversion to per unit distance is N(r) = N(plx) * |dplx/dr| ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:\nGiven n(p)∝1/p^5 and p=1/r, so dp=−dr/r^2. The number per unit r is n(r)=n(p)|dp/dr|∝(r^5)(1/r^2)=r^3.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 79YQ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent jaKR:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6GRO:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mN8g:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
