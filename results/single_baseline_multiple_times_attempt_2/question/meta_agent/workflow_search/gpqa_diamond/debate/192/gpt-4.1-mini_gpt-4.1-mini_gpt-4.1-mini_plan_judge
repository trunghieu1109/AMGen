Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ∝ 1/r, substituting plx = 1/r gives the number of stars ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.
