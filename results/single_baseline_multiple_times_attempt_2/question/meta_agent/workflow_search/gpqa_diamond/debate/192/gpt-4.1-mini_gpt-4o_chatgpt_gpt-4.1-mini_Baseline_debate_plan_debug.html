    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which means it is proportional to plx^5. Substituting plx = 1/r, we get the number of stars proportional to (1/r)^5, which simplifies to r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r. Therefore, the number of stars varies as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. This means the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Therefore, 1/plx^5 ~ r^5. Thus, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, giving us the expression for the number of stars as ~ (r)^5. However, we are interested in how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which requires considering the volume of space at a given distance. The volume of a spherical shell at distance r is proportional to r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is the number of stars times the volume element, which is ~ r^5 * r^2 = r^7. But we want the number of stars per unit distance, so we need to consider the density of stars, which is the number of stars divided by the volume element, giving us ~ r^5.

### answer by Debate Agent 79YQ:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent mN8g:
D) ~ r^5

    <pre>The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), so plx = 1/r. Substituting this into the expression, the number of stars varies as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which involves considering the volume of space at a given distance. The volume of a spherical shell at distance r is proportional to r^2.
