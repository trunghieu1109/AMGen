Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have N(p) ∝ 1/p^5 and p = 1/r, so dp/dr = -1/r^2. Then N(r) ∝ N(p) |dp/dr| ∝ r^5 * 1/r^2 = r^3, corresponding to choice C).

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
