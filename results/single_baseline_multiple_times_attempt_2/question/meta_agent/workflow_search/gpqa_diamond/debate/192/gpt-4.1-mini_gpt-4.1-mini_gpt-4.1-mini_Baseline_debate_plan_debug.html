    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Therefore, 1/plx^5 = 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. So, the number of stars varies as r^5 with distance. Hence, the correct choice is the one that says ~ r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, we need to find how the number of stars varies with distance r. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance r, i.e., plx ∝ 1/r. Therefore, plx = k/r for some constant k. Substituting plx into the given relation: Number of stars ∝ 1/(plx^5) = 1/((k/r)^5) = 1/(k^5 / r^5) = r^5 / k^5. Since k is a constant, the number of stars varies as r^5. Hence, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, we know that parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r, i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Therefore, 1/plx^5 = (r)^5. Hence, the number of stars varies as r^5 with distance. So, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r, we can substitute plx = 1/r into the expression. Thus, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.
