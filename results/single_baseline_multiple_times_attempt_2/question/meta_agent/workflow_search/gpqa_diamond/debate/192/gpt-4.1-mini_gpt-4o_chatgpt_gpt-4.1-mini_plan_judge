Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), so plx = 1/r. Substituting this into the expression, the number of stars varies as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which involves considering the volume of space at a given distance. The volume of a spherical shell at distance r is proportional to r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is the number of stars times the volume element, which is ~ r^5 * r^2 = r^7. But we want the number of stars per unit distance, so we need to consider the density of stars, which is the number of stars divided by the volume element, giving us ~ r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r^5.
