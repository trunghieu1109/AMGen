Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.85 g/mol. The moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve, so total moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. Using 0.1 M acid, the volume needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. This matches closely with 28.05 cm3 in choice 1. The pH after dissolution is expected to be around 2.04, which also matches choice 1. Other choices have either incorrect volume or pH values. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A).
