Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃: 0.1 g / 106.87 g·mol⁻¹ ≈ 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. It needs 3 mol H⁺ per mol to dissolve: 2.81×10⁻³ mol H⁺. At 0.1 M acid, the minimum volume is 2.81×10⁻³/0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm³. After neutralization, any excess acid gives the final [H⁺] and thus the pH. To get a realistic pH around 2.7, you need about 30 cm³ of 0.1 M acid so that (0.1·0.03009 − 0.00281)/0.1 = 0.00201 M H⁺, pH ≈ 2.69. That matches choice B).
