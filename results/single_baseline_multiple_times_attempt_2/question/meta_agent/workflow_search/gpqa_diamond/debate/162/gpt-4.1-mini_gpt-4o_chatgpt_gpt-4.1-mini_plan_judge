Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves dissolving Fe(OH)3 in an acidic solution. The key is to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 and the corresponding moles of H+ needed to dissolve it. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to 0.000936 mol. The reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, so 0.002808 mol of H+ is needed. Using a 0.1 M acid, the volume required is 28.08 cm3. The total volume becomes 128.08 cm3, and the concentration of H+ is 0.0219 M, giving a pH of 1.66. However, considering the choices, the closest match is choice A with pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3, which suggests a possible rounding or approximation in the problem statement.
