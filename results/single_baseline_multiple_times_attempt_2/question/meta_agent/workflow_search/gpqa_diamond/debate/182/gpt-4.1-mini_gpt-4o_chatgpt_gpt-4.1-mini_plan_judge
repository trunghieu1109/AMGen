Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is a measure of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The initial compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring (1 IHD), a vinyl group (1 IHD), and a formyl group (1 IHD), giving an initial IHD of 3. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI typically reduces double bonds and replaces oxygen-containing groups with iodine, leading to a saturated product. This means all double bonds are reduced, and the IHD is reduced to 0, as the product is fully saturated. Therefore, the final IHD of the product is 0.
