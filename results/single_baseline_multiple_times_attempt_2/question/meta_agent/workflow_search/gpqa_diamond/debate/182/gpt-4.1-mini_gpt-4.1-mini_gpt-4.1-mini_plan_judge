Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The initial compound has multiple degrees of unsaturation: one ring, one double bond in the ring, one formyl group (aldehyde), one carboxylic acid group, and one vinyl group, totaling 5 IHD. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI reduces the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups to alkyl groups, and also saturates the double bonds in the ring and the vinyl group. The ring remains intact, so the only remaining degree of unsaturation is the ring itself, which counts as 1. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.
