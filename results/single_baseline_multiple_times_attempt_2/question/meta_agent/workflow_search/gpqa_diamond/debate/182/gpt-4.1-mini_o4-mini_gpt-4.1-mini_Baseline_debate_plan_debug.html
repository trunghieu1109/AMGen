    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent lzdt:
HI with red phosphorus reduces the aldehyde (–CHO) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) substituents by cleavage of C–C bonds, converting each to a proton. Both substituents (formyl at C2 and carboxyl at C1) are removed, each losing one carbon, but the ring core (6 C) and the vinyl group (2 C) remain. The product is thus 5-vinylcyclohexene, C8H12. Its IHD = (2C + 2 – H)/2 = (2×8 + 2 – 12)/2 = 3. Counting ring (1) + two double bonds (2) also gives 3, matching choice B.

### thinking by Debate Agent ydVS:
The given molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Treatment with Hi/red P reduces the carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid) to methyl groups but leaves the C=C bonds intact. The original cyclohex-3-ene ring contributes 1 degree of unsaturation, the vinyl substituent contributes another 1, and the ring itself contributes 1, giving a total index of hydrogen deficiency of 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent wZed:
Red P/HI reduces R–COOH and R–CHO to R–H by removing the substituent entirely. Starting from 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, both the formyl (at C2) and carboxyl (at C1) groups are removed, leaving 5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene. That molecule has one ring plus two C=C bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl), for a total degree of unsaturation = 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent w3UP:
The HI/red P reaction decarboxylates COOH (removes that substituent entirely), reduces –CHO to –CH3, and hydrogenates alkenes (including vinyl substituent and the ring double bond) via HI addition and reduction. Thus the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (1 ring), with a methyl at C2 and an ethyl at C5. The product formula is C9H18. The saturated alkane formula C9 would be C9H20; (20–18)/2 = 1 degree of unsaturation, corresponding to the ring. Therefore the IHD is 1.

    <pre>Red P/HI strongly reduces and removes carboxyl groups (–COOH) by decarboxylation and also deoxygenates aldehydes (–CHO) to H, but does not hydrogenate C=C bonds. Starting from 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, both the –COOH at C1 and –CHO at C2 are lost, yielding 5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene, which has one ring plus two C=C bonds. Therefore the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.
