Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Red P/HI strongly reduces and removes carboxyl groups (–COOH) by decarboxylation and also deoxygenates aldehydes (–CHO) to H, but does not hydrogenate C=C bonds. Starting from 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, both the –COOH at C1 and –CHO at C2 are lost, yielding 5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene, which has one ring plus two C=C bonds. Therefore the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.
