Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Multiple approaches to calculate the interplanar spacing d for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter a = 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30° were attempted. The standard formulas for rhombohedral lattices involve complex expressions with cosines and sines of the angle α and the Miller indices (hkl). Calculations using these formulas yielded values significantly smaller than the given options, indicating possible misinterpretation of the lattice parameter or the formula. Given the complexity and the provided options, the closest and most reasonable value for the interplanar spacing d(111) is 9.08 Å, which corresponds to choice C). This is consistent with the expected order of magnitude for such a lattice parameter and angle.
