Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is complex, but the key is to correctly apply the formula and simplify it. The majority of the agents calculated the interplanar distance to be approximately 9.08 Angstrom, which corresponds to choice C). Agent Z92x's calculation seems to have an error in simplification, leading to a different result. Therefore, the consensus among the other agents is likely correct, and the interplanar distance is approximately 9.08 Angstrom.
