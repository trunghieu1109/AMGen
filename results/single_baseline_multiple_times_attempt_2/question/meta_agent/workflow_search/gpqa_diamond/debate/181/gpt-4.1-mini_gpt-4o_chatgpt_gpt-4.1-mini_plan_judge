Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation is used to describe the space-charge-limited current in semiconductor devices. It is valid under specific conditions: the device should be a trap-free single-carrier system, meaning only one type of charge carrier is considered, and it should have no carrier injection barrier, implying that the contacts are Ohmic. Additionally, the diffusion current should be negligible compared to the drift current. The equation assumes that the current is limited by the space charge rather than by traps or recombination. Based on these conditions, choice 1 aligns with the requirements for the Mott-Gurney equation: a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.
