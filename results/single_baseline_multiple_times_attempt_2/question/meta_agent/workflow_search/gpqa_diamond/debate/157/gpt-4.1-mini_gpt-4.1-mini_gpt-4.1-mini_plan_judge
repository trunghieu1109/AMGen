Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The transcription factor functions as a dimer, and mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically produce mutant proteins that can still dimerize with the wild-type protein but render the dimer nonfunctional, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in the presence of a wild-type allele. This often results in protein aggregation or formation of defective complexes that interfere with normal function. Loss of dimerization would not cause a dominant-negative effect because the mutant protein would not interact with the wild-type protein. Protein degradation is less typical for dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains, and gain-of-function is inconsistent with the dominant-negative loss-of-function description. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
