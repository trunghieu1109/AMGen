Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question involves a transcription factor with two mutations: a recessive loss-of-function mutation X in the transactivation domain and a dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation typically interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming non-functional complexes. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain suggests it affects dimer formation. The presence of mutation Y likely leads to a non-functional dimer, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. The most likely molecular phenotype is that the mutant protein interferes with normal dimerization, causing aggregation and loss of function. Therefore, the choice 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' aligns with the expected outcome.
