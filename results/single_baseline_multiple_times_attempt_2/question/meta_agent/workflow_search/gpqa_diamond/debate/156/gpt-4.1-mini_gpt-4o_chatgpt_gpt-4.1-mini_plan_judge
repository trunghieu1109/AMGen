Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that for a retrovirus, which has an RNA genome, the appropriate initial step is to perform cDNA sequencing. This is because retroviruses require reverse transcription to convert their RNA into cDNA for sequencing. Once the viral genome is identified, a real-time PCR kit can be developed for quick and accurate detection of the virus. This method is more direct and specific than antibody-based methods, which detect the host's immune response rather than the virus itself. Therefore, the best choice is to perform cDNA sequencing followed by the development of a real-time PCR kit.
