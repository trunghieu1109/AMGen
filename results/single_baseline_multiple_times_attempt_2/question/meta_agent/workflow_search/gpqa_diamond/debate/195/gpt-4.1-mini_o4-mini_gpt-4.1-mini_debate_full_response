At x=0 all energy is kinetic: E=γm c^2 so γ=1+ kA^2/(2m c^2). Thus v_max=c√(1−1/γ^2)=c√[1−1/(1+kA^2/(2m c^2))^2].\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Hj0Z:\nTotal energy E = mc^2 + ½kA^2 at turning point. At x=0 kinetic energy gives γmc^2 = E ⇒ γ = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). Then v_max = c√(1 – 1/γ^2) = c√[1 – 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2], which is choice B.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ieey:\nWe use conservation of total energy: at amplitude x=A, speed v=0 so total energy E=m c^2 + ½ kA^2. At x=0 potential is zero, so kinetic energy is E - m c^2 = (½ kA^2). Then gamma_max = E/(m c^2) = 1 + δ with δ = kA^2/(2m c^2). Hence 1/√(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + δ ⇒ 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + δ)^2 ⇒ v_max = c √[1 - 1/(1 + δ)^2], which matches choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7Iqo:\nWe use energy conservation: at maximum amplitude x=A, speed is zero so total energy E = mc^2 + ½kA^2. At x=0, potential energy is zero and speed is vmax so E = γmc^2. Therefore γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2) and vmax = c√(1−1/γ^2) = c√(1−1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which matches choice B).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ENDl:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Hj0Z:\nB\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ieey:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 7Iqo:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
