proposed answer: The problem involves a relativistic harmonic oscillator where the total energy is conserved. At maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero and the total energy is the rest mass energy plus the potential energy: E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed v_max, the potential energy is zero and the total energy is purely relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy: E = gamma * mc^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2 / c^2). Equating these energies gives gamma = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2). Solving for v_max yields v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2). This matches choice 2 exactly.
