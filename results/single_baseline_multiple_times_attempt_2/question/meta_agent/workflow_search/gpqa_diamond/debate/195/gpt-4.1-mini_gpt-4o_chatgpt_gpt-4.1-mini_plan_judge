Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the potential energy at maximum amplitude to the relativistic kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA^2, and the relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Solving for gamma gives gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). The Lorentz factor is also 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2). Equating these and solving for v_max gives v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This matches choice B.
