### thinking by Debate Agent Xlyw:
We need to build 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The high-yield approach uses: (1) nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene; (2) reduction to aniline; (3) Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation para to the amino (as anilinium salt, deactivated, gives ortho/para but mainly para to NH3+); (4) nitration installs the nitrometa to the amino; (5) diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and hydrolysis (H3O+, heat) convert the amino to phenol; (6) Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) gives the ethoxy; steps iv–vii are protection/desulfonation if needed. Choice 4 matches this sequence most closely.

### thinking by Debate Agent hvkM:
We need to introduce the nitro first (nitration), reduce to aniline, diazotize and hydrolyze to phenol, convert to ethoxy by Williamson, install a blocking sulfonyl, do Friedel–Crafts tert-butyl at ortho, remove sulfo, then final nitration at the meta (3) position. Scanning the sequences, only option D begins with nitration and reduction and includes diazotization, hydrolysis, Williamson, sulfonation/desulfonation, and tert-butylation in the roughly correct order.

### thinking by Debate Agent OaCI:
The high‐yield approach first introduces the –NO2 to give nitrobenzene, reduces to aniline, diazotizes and hydrolyzes to phenol, converts to the ethyl ether, then installs the tert‐butyl by Friedel–Crafts ortho to the ether, and finally nitrates to put –NO2 ortho to both substituents. Choice 4 is the only sequence matching those steps in order.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2Eed:
The target 2‐(tert‐butyl)‐1‐ethoxy‐3‐nitrobenzene can be built by first converting benzene to phenol via nitration → reduction → diazotization → hydrolysis, then etherifying to the ethoxy, then using sulfonation as a temporary blocking group to direct tert‐butylation to the ortho position, removing the sulfo group, and finally introducing the nitro at the meta position to the ethoxy. Only sequence 4 begins with nitration, follows with reduction (Fe/HCl), installs the diazonium (NaNO₂/HCl), hydrolyzes to phenol (H₃O⁺, heat), ethers to ethoxy (NaOH/EtBr), then uses SO₃/H₂SO₄ to block, tert‐butylates, deblocks with dilute H₂SO₄, and nitrates last. Hence choice 4 is correct.

    <pre>The optimal high‐yield route installs the nitro first (nitration), reduces to aniline, converts to phenol by diazotization/hydrolysis, etherifies to the ethoxy, uses sulfonation to block the para position, performs Friedel–Crafts tert‐butylation at the ortho position, removes the sulfo group, and yields the final nitroarene. Among the options only sequence 4 begins with nitration and reduction, then follows through with the diazo–hydrolysis to phenol and etherification steps, fitting the high‐yield strategy. Thus choice 4 (D) is correct.
