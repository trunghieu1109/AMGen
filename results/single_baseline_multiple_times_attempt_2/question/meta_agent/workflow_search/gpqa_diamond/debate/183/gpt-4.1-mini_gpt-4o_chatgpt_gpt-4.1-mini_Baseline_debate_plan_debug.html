### thinking by Debate Agent Xlyw:
To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, we need to introduce a tert-butyl group, a nitro group, and an ethoxy group in the correct positions. The tert-butyl group and the nitro group can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation and nitration, respectively. The ethoxy group can be introduced by first converting a nitro group to an amine, diazotizing the amine, and then replacing it with an ethoxy group. The sequence should be: 1) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, 2) nitration to introduce the nitro group, 3) reduction of the nitro group to an amine, 4) diazotization of the amine, 5) conversion to an ethoxy group using NaOH/EtBr. The correct sequence of reactions is found in choice 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent hvkM:
To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, we need to introduce the tert-butyl group, nitro group, and ethoxy group onto the benzene ring in a specific order to achieve the desired substitution pattern. Starting with benzene, the tert-butyl group should be introduced first using Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, as it is a bulky group and will direct further substituents to the ortho and para positions. Next, we should introduce the nitro group using nitration with HNO3/H2SO4, which will likely go to the para position due to steric hindrance at the ortho position. Finally, to introduce the ethoxy group, we can perform an etherification reaction. The sequence of reactions that achieves this is: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group, ii) HNO3/H2SO4 to introduce the nitro group, and then vii) NaOH/EtBr to introduce the ethoxy group. This matches choice 1, which follows the correct order of reactions.

### thinking by Debate Agent OaCI:
To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the steps should be: 1) Introduce the tert-butyl group using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), 2) Nitrate the benzene ring using HNO3/H2SO4 to introduce the nitro group, and 3) Introduce the ethoxy group via an ether synthesis. The correct sequence should introduce the tert-butyl group first to direct further substitutions to the correct positions. The ethoxy group can be introduced by converting a hydroxyl group to an ether using NaOH and EtBr. Considering these steps, choice 1 seems to have the correct reagents in the correct order.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2Eed:
To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we need to consider the steps that introduce the tert-butyl group, the nitro group, and the ethoxy group in the correct positions. First, we introduce the tert-butyl group using Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. Next, we introduce the nitro group using nitration with HNO3/H2SO4. Finally, we convert a hydrogen to an ethoxy group using nucleophilic substitution with NaOH and EtBr. The sequence that correctly accomplishes these transformations with minimal rearrangement and high yield is: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) NaOH/EtBr. This sequence corresponds to choice 1.
