    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;pre-initiation complex&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;pre-replication complex&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;enhancer protein complex&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;nucleosome histone complex&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent fBw6:
Active chromatin in the shmoo (transcriptionally active regions) will be associated with factors involved in transcription initiation (pre-initiation complex), enhancer proteins, and nucleosome histones. The pre-replication complex is loaded at replication origins during G1 and is not specifically associated with actively transcribed chromatin regions targeted by ChIP in the shmoo.

### thinking by Debate Agent dzzT:
Active chromatin immunoprecipitation of transcriptionally active regions will capture transcription-related complexes (pre-initiation complexes, enhancer-associated factors) and histones. Pre-replication complexes load at origins in G1 and are not components of active transcription chromatin, so they will be least present.

### thinking by Debate Agent tmsD:
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin in shmoo cells will enrich proteins associated with transcription (pre‐initiation complex, enhancer binding proteins) and core histones at nucleosomes. The pre‐replication complex (ORC, Cdc6, MCMs) is associated specifically with origins during replication initiation but not with actively transcribed regions, and in pheromone‐arrested (G1) shmoo cells replication does not proceed. Thus these proteins will be least represented in the active‐chromatin proteome.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6XrI:
We want proteins bound to active chromatin in shmoo cells (transcriptionally active). ChIP-MS will pull down histones (nucleosome histone complex), transcription initiation factors (pre-initiation complex), and transcription activators at enhancers (enhancer protein complex). However, the pre-replication complex loads at origins to license DNA replication and is not part of active transcriptional chromatin, especially in G1-arrested mating cells. Thus the least represented proteins will be from the pre-replication complex.

    <pre>Active chromatin in shmoo cells is transcriptionally active, so ChIP-MS will recover transcription-related complexes (pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex) and histones (nucleosome histone complex). The pre-replication complex is only associated with replication origins during S phase/G1 licensing, not with active transcription, especially in G1-arrested shmoo cells. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex will be least observed.
