Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks which protein complex would be least observed in the proteome of active chromatin isolated from the shmoo form of yeast treated with a quorum-sensing peptide. The shmoo formation is related to mating and involves active transcriptional changes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry would capture proteins associated with active chromatin. The pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are all associated with active chromatin and transcriptional regulation. The pre-replication complex, however, is involved in DNA replication initiation and is not typically associated with active transcriptional chromatin, especially in the context of shmoo formation which is a mating response rather than DNA replication. Therefore, the pre-replication complex proteins would be least observed in this assay.
