Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks which protein complex will be least observed in the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The shmoo formation is related to mating and involves transcriptional changes. Active chromatin is associated with transcription, so proteins from transcription-related complexes like the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex are expected. The nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin and will be present. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, not transcription, and is less likely to be associated with active chromatin in the context of shmoo formation. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex are least likely to be observed.
