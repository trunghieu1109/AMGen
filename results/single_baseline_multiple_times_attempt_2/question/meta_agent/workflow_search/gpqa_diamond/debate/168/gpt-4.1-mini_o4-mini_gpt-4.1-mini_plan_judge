Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The original decay has four bodies (2 electrons + 2 neutrinos), so the summed electron spectrum is continuous up to Q because the neutrinos share energy arbitrarily. Replacing the two neutrinos with one massless exotic still leaves a three-body final state (2 electrons + M), so the spectrum remains continuous, but with a different phase-space weighting (shape). Since the exotic is massless (whereas two neutrinos carry at least a tiny rest mass), the maximum electron energy is slightly higher, shifting the endpoint up.
