    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Uxz:
This is analogous to neutrinoless double beta decay: replacing two neutrinos (two-body phase space) with a single exotic (three-body decay: two electrons + one exotic particle) reduces the number of light particles. The electron energy‐sum spectrum becomes a monoenergetic line (discrete) at the full Q value, whereas the original decay has a continuous distribution up to Q. Thus the spectrum becomes discrete, with the electrons reaching a higher maximum energy (effectively the full Q), compared to the continuous distribution endpoint in the original decay.

### thinking by Debate Agent qGTQ:
The standard 2νββ‐decay (2A→2B+2e⁻+2ν) yields a continuous summed‐electron spectrum up to the Q‐value because the two neutrinos share energy arbitrarily. Replacing the two neutrinos by one massless boson M (single majoron emission) still leaves one freely sharing carrier, so the electron sum‐energy remains continuous. Since M is massless (whereas the two ν’s carried at least 2mν of rest energy), less rest‐mass energy is locked up, so the maximum kinetic energy available to the electrons is slightly larger. Hence: continuous spectrum with shifted (increased) endpoint.

### thinking by Debate Agent Cc5z:
The continuous energy sharing among three light particles (2E + 2V) gives a broad continuous E-sum spectrum up to endpoint Q. Replacing two (massive) V’s by one exactly massless M still leaves three bodies (2E + M), so the E energy sum remains continuously distributed. Because the new particle M can have zero energy (p=0) with no rest mass, the E’s can now carry away the full decay Q0 instead of Q0 – 2mV. Thus the endpoint increases.

### thinking by Debate Agent yai1:
The original double-β decay (2A→2B+2E+2V) is a three-body decay as far as the two electrons and the two neutrinos are concerned, so the summed electron energy is continuous up to the total Q‐value. Replacing the two neutrinos by one massless exotic M still leaves three final particles (2E+M), so the summed electron spectrum remains continuous, but with a different kinematic weighting (shape). Since M is massless (whereas real neutrinos carry at least a tiny rest mass), the maximum possible electron energy is slightly larger than in the 2ν case, so the spectral endpoint increases.

    <pre>The original decay has four bodies (2 electrons + 2 neutrinos), so the summed electron spectrum is continuous up to Q because the neutrinos share energy arbitrarily. Replacing the two neutrinos with one massless exotic still leaves a three-body final state (2 electrons + M), so the spectrum remains continuous, but with a different phase-space weighting (shape). Since the exotic is massless (whereas two neutrinos carry at least a tiny rest mass), the maximum electron energy is slightly higher, shifting the endpoint up.
