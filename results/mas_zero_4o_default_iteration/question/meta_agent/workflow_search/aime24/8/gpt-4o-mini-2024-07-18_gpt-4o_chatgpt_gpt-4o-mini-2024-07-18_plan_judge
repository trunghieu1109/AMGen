Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
proposed answer: The task is to count the number of integers up to 2024 that are winning positions for Bob. From the previous sub-tasks, we know that Bob wins if the number of tokens is not a multiple of 3. There are 2024 total numbers from 1 to 2024. To find the number of multiples of 3, we divide 2024 by 3, which gives approximately 674.67. The largest integer less than or equal to this is 674, meaning there are 674 multiples of 3 up to 2024. Therefore, the number of integers that are not multiples of 3 is 2024 - 674 = 1350. This calculation has been verified and is correct.

Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
proposed answer: The problem involves determining the number of winning positions for Bob in a game where the positions are of the form n = 2 + 3k, with k being a non-negative integer. The task is to count how many such positions exist for n <= 2024. Solving the inequality 2 + 3k <= 2024 gives 3k <= 2022, leading to k <= 674. Therefore, k can take values from 0 to 674 inclusive, resulting in 675 possible values for k. Each value of k corresponds to a winning position for Bob. The previous attempts and feedback confirm that this reasoning and calculation are correct.
