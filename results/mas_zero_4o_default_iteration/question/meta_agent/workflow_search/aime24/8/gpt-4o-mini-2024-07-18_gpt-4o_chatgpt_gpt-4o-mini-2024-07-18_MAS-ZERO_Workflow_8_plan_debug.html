    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

### Sub-task 2: Based on the losing positions for Alice from Sub-task 1, determine the winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking by CoT-SC Agent eUnN:
In the game, a position is winning for Bob if it is a losing position for Alice. From Sub-task 1, we identified the losing positions for Alice as those of the form 2 + 3k for k = 0, 1, 2, ... Therefore, these positions are winning for Bob because if Alice starts at one of these positions, she cannot make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position. Thus, the winning positions for Bob are exactly the same as the losing positions for Alice, which are n = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ...

### answer by CoT-SC Agent eUnN:
The winning positions for Bob are n = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ... which are of the form 2 + 3k for k = 0, 1, 2, ...

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6PWC (yourself):
The winning positions for Bob are of the form n = 2 + 3k, where k is a non-negative integer. We need to find how many such positions exist for n &lt;= 2024. We set up the inequality 2 + 3k &lt;= 2024 to find the maximum value of k. Solving for k, we get 3k &lt;= 2022, so k &lt;= 674. Therefore, k can take values from 0 to 674 inclusive, which gives us 675 possible values for k. Each value of k corresponds to a winning position for Bob.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6PWC (yourself):
675

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent fDOu:
The reasoning provided is correct. The winning positions for Bob are indeed of the form n = 2 + 3k, where k is a non-negative integer. The calculation of the number of such positions up to 2024 is also correct.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6PWC (yourself):
The winning positions for Bob are those of the form n = 2 + 3k, where k is a non-negative integer. To find how many such positions exist for n &lt;= 2024, we solve the inequality 2 + 3k &lt;= 2024. This simplifies to 3k &lt;= 2022, so k &lt;= 674. Therefore, k can take values from 0 to 674 inclusive, which gives us 675 possible values for k. Each value of k corresponds to a winning position for Bob. The previous calculations and feedback confirm this reasoning is correct.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent fDOu:
The reasoning provided in thinking #2 is correct. The winning positions for Bob are those of the form n = 2 + 3k, where k is a non-negative integer. Solving 2 + 3k &lt;= 2024 gives k &lt;= 674, so there are 675 such positions.
