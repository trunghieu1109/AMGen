Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
proposed answer: To find the number of b-beautiful integers for a given base b, we need to count the number of perfect squares n in the range from b to b^2 - 1 that satisfy the condition that the sum of the digits of n in base b equals the square root of n. For each n in this range, n = ab + c, where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b, and a + c = sqrt(n). We need to check each perfect square in this range to see if it can be expressed in this form. The number of such integers will depend on the number of perfect squares in the range and whether they satisfy the digit sum condition. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 such integers. This requires checking each base b starting from b = 2 and counting the number of b-beautiful integers until we find a base with more than 10.

For each base b, we check each integer n from b to b^2 - 1 to see if it is a perfect square and if there exist digits a and c such that 1 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b, and a + c = sqrt(n). We continue this process for increasing values of b until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful integers.
