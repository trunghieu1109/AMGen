Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
proposed answer: From Sub-task 1, we have s = 9/(4 - t). From Sub-task 2, we found t = 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. Substituting t = 0.4 into the equation for s gives s = 9/(4 - 0.4) = 9/3.6 = 2.5 km/h. Now, we need to find the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 km at s + 1/2 km/h. So, s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. The walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours. Including the 24 minutes (0.4 hours) spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Converting 0.4 hours to minutes gives 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time in minutes is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 3 * 60 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
proposed answer: From Sub-task 1, we have the equation s = 9/(4 - t). From Sub-task 2, we determined that t = 1 hour. Substituting t = 1 into the equation for s, we get s = 9/(4 - 1) = 9/3 = 3 km/h. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 km at s + 1/2 km/h. So, s + 1/2 = 3 + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h. The walking time is 9/3.5 hours. 9/3.5 = 2.5714 hours, which is approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes. Including the 1 hour spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 2 hours and 34 minutes + 1 hour = 3 hours and 34 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we have 3 * 60 + 34 = 214 minutes.
