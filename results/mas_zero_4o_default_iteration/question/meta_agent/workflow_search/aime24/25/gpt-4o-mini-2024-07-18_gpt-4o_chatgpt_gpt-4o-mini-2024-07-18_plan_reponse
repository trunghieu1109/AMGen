        "response": "The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, known as a parallelohexagon. The extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The side length of the hexagon is related to the side lengths of this triangle. In sub-task 2, it was determined that the side length of the hexagon is a common factor in the distances between parallel sides, and the answer given was 60. This suggests that the side length of the hexagon is 60, as it is a common divisor of the triangle's side lengths and fits the geometric properties of the hexagon.\n\nAnswer:60",
