Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
proposed answer: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, known as a parallelohexagon. The extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The side length of the hexagon is related to the side lengths of this triangle. In sub-task 2, it was determined that the side length of the hexagon is a common factor in the distances between parallel sides, and the answer given was 60. This suggests that the side length of the hexagon is 60, as it is a common divisor of the triangle's side lengths and fits the geometric properties of the hexagon.

proposed answer: The sub-task 2 answer indicates that the side length of the hexagon is half of the smallest side of the triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. The smallest side of the triangle is 200, so the side length of the hexagon is 100.
