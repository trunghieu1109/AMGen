        "response": "We have the area of triangle ABC as 78 and the semi-perimeter s as 13. The formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its circumradius R and sides a, b, c is A = abc / (4R). We also have the condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI}, which implies that the triangle is right-angled at A. In a right triangle, the circumradius R is half the hypotenuse. However, we are not given which side is the hypotenuse directly. We can use the formula A = r * s = 78 to find the area, and we know R = 13. We can use the relation A = abc / (4R) to find ab = AB * AC. Substituting the known values, we have 78 = ab / (4 * 13), which simplifies to ab = 78 * 52 / 13 = 312. Therefore, AB * AC = 312.\n\nAnswer:312",

        "response": "The problem involves a triangle with specific conditions: the circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6, and the condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). The area A = 78 and semi-perimeter s = 13 are correctly calculated. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) is a special geometric condition that implies a specific relationship between the sides of the triangle. This condition is known to occur in a triangle when the triangle is isosceles and the angle bisector of the vertex angle is perpendicular to the line joining the incenter and circumcenter. In such a configuration, the triangle is not necessarily right-angled, and the previous assumption that the hypotenuse is 26 is incorrect. Instead, we should use the known geometric result that in such a configuration, the product of the sides opposite the equal angles (AB and AC) is given by \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4Rr \\). Substituting the given values, we have \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4 \\times 13 \\times 6 = 312 \\).\n\nAnswer:312",
