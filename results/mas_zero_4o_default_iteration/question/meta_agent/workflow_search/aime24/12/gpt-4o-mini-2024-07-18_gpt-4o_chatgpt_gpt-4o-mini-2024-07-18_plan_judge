Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
proposed answer: The expression 324\cos(θ) + 432\sin(θ) can be rewritten in the form R\cos(θ - φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540. The phase shift φ is determined by \tan(φ) = 432/324 = 4/3, so φ = \arctan(4/3). The maximum value of the expression occurs when \cos(θ - φ) = 1, which means θ = φ. Therefore, the value of θ that maximizes the real part is φ = \arctan(4/3).

Answer:arctan(4/3)
Extracted answer: arctan(4/3)
Correct answer: 540
Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
proposed answer: To maximize the real part of the expression 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ), we can express it in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), calculated as R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540. The angle φ is determined by the equations cos(φ) = 324/540 and sin(φ) = -432/540, which simplify to cos(φ) = 3/5 and sin(φ) = -4/5. The maximum value of the expression occurs when cos(θ + φ) = 1, which is when θ + φ = 0, leading to θ = -φ. Therefore, the value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = -φ, where φ satisfies the given trigonometric identities.

Answer:θ = -φ, where φ satisfies cos(φ) = 3/5 and sin(φ) = -4/5.
Extracted answer: θ = -φ, where φ satisfies cos(φ) = 3/5 and sin(φ) = -4/5.
Correct answer: 540
