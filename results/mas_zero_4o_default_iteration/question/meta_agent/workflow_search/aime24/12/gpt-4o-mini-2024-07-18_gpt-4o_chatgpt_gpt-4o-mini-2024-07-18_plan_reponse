        "response": "To maximize the real part of the expression 324 cos(\u03b8) - 432 sin(\u03b8), we can express it in the form R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), calculated as R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540. The angle \u03c6 is determined by the equations cos(\u03c6) = 324/540 and sin(\u03c6) = -432/540, which simplify to cos(\u03c6) = 3/5 and sin(\u03c6) = -4/5. The maximum value of the expression occurs when cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = 1, which is when \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 0, leading to \u03b8 = -\u03c6. Therefore, the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the real part is \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 satisfies the given trigonometric identities.\n\nAnswer:\u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 satisfies cos(\u03c6) = 3/5 and sin(\u03c6) = -4/5.",
