    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Generate all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent C8J6:
To generate all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, we need to consider all combinations of nonnegative integers a, b, and c that sum to 300. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the stars and bars method. The number of solutions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the sum (300) and k is the number of variables (3). Therefore, the number of solutions is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent C8J6:
45551

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent TPcv (yourself):
The problem requires filtering the 45551 possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 to find those that also satisfy the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. This is a complex task because it involves checking each of the 45551 combinations to see if they satisfy the second equation. The equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, which might help reduce the number of cases to check, but it is still computationally intensive to verify each combination. Without computational assistance or further simplification of the equation, it is challenging to manually filter these triples.

Suggestion: Use computational tools to iterate over all possible triples (a, b, c) and check which ones satisfy the given equation. Alternatively, look for patterns or simplifications in the equation that might reduce the number of cases to check.
