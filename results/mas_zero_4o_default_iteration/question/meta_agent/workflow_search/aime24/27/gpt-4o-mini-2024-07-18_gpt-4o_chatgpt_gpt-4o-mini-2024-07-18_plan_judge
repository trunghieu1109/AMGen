Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the sum of the quotient (Q) and remainder (R) when the number N, which is 9996, is divided by 1000. From the related sub-task, it is given that when 9996 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 996. Therefore, Q + R is simply 9 + 996.

proposed answer: The problem has been solved in the related original question. The greatest four-digit integer N that satisfies the condition is 7776. When 7776 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 776. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 776 = 783. This calculation is straightforward and has been verified as correct.
