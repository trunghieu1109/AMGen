Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: The functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) both have ranges [0, 1]. For the graphs to intersect, we need points (x, y) such that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) = y. This implies 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since g(f(x)) maps [0, 1/2] to [0, 1/4], this condition is satisfied when f(sin(2πx)) = f(cos(3πy)). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is symmetric about x = 0 and x = 1, mapping [-1, 1] to [0, 1/2]. The condition f(sin(2πx)) = f(cos(3πy)) means either |sin(2πx)| = |cos(3πy)| or |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| are symmetric about 1/2. Both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) oscillate between -1 and 1, so the condition |sin(2πx)| = |cos(3πy)| is quite restrictive. The number of solutions can be found by considering the periodicity and symmetry of the sine and cosine functions. Specifically, the period of sin(2πx) is 1 and the period of cos(3πy) is 2/3. Considering these periodicities and the condition |sin(2πx)| = |cos(3πy)|, we find there are 6 intersections in one period of sin(2πx), which is 1. Therefore, the number of intersections is 6.

Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: The functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) both have ranges [0, 1]. The function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1, while x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) is periodic with period 2/3. For the graphs to intersect, we need y = x, meaning both functions must take the same value. Since both functions range from 0 to 1, we look for points where they are equal. The periodicity of the functions suggests that intersections will occur periodically. Specifically, both functions will be equal at y = x = 0 and y = x = 1, as well as at other points within their periods. Given the periodicity, the functions will intersect at y = x = 0 and y = x = 1 within each period of 2/3. Therefore, within one full cycle of the smaller period (2/3), there are 2 intersection points. As x varies from 0 to 1, there will be 3 full cycles of the smaller period (2/3), leading to 3 * 2 = 6 intersection points.
