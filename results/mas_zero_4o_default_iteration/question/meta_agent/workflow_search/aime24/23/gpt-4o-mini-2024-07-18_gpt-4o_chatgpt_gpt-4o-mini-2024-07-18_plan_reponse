        "response": "To find the common combinations that satisfy both conditions, we need to compare the results from sub-task 3 and sub-task 4. Sub-task 3 provides pairs of top and bottom row numbers that sum to 999, while sub-task 4 provides digit combinations that sum to 99 when read top to bottom. We need to ensure that the digit combinations from sub-task 4 match the top and bottom row numbers from sub-task 3. For example, from sub-task 3, one pair is top row 9 and bottom row 990. From sub-task 4, the combination (0,0,9) with (9,9,0) matches this pair because the top row 9 corresponds to (0,0,9) and the bottom row 990 corresponds to (9,9,0). We repeat this process for each pair from sub-task 3 and check if there is a corresponding combination from sub-task 4.\n\nAnswer:The common combinations are: (0,0,9) with (9,9,0), (0,1,8) with (9,8,1), (0,2,7) with (9,7,2), (0,3,6) with (9,6,3), (0,4,5) with (9,5,4), (0,5,4) with (9,4,5), (0,6,3) with (9,3,6), (0,7,2) with (9,2,7), (0,8,1) with (9,1,8), (0,9,0) with (9,0,9).",
