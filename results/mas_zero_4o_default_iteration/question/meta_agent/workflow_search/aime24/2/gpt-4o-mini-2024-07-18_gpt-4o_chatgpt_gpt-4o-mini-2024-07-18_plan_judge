Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
proposed answer: The probability that a valid rotation exists is given as 1/8, which is already in its simplest form. The integers m and n are 1 and 8, respectively, and they are relatively prime. Therefore, m+n is simply 1+8.

Answer:9
Extracted answer: 9
Correct answer: 371

What is $m+n$?
proposed answer: The probability that a valid rotation exists is given as 9/256. The numbers 9 and 256 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Thus, m = 9 and n = 256, and m+n = 265.
