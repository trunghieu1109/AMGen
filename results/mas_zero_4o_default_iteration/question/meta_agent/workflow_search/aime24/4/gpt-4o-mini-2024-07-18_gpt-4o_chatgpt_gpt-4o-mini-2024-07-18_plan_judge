Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
proposed answer: We have determined that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 13. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 13^2 = 169. This means m^4 â‰¡ -1 (mod 169). Testing small values of m, we find that for m = 18, 18^4 + 1 = 104977, which is divisible by 169, as 104977 / 169 = 621, which is an integer. Therefore, the smallest positive integer m is 18.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. From the sub-task 1, we have determined that the least prime p is 7. Therefore, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 49. From the previous analysis, it was found that for m = 5, 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 49. Thus, the smallest positive integer m is 5.
