Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$..

### Sub-task 1: Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 16mM:
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. This means that n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). We start by considering small prime numbers and checking if such an n exists. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4 because n^4 is always even, making n^4 + 1 odd. For p = 3, we check if n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9). We find that for n = 2, 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 9. For n = 3, 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 9. For p = 5, we check if n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25). We find that for n = 3, 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. For n = 4, 4^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. For p = 7, we check if n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 49). We find that for n = 5, 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 49. Therefore, the least prime number p is 7.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent VEas (yourself):
We have determined that the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 7. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 7^2 = 49. We need to check small values of m to find the smallest one that satisfies this condition. We calculate m^4 + 1 for small values of m and check divisibility by 49. For m = 5, we have 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 49. Therefore, the smallest positive integer m is 5.
