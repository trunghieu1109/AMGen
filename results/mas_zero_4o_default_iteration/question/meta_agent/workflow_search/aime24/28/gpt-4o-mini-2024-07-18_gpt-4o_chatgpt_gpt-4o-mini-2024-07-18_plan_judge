Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of tangency circles of a torus and a sphere, expressed as a rational number m/n, where m and n are relatively prime, and then finding m+n. The derived expression for this difference is 2*sqrt(7) - 4*sqrt(10), which involves irrational numbers. This expression cannot be simplified into a rational number using standard algebraic methods, as the square roots do not simplify to rational numbers. Without additional context or a method to transform this into a rational number, the task remains unsolvable in its current form. The problem might involve specific approximations or relationships between these square roots that are not provided, making it impossible to express the difference in the required rational form as it stands. Thus, without additional information or a method to rationalize this expression, the task cannot be completed in its current form.

[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: The problem requires additional context or a different approach to express the difference in a rational form. Consider exploring geometric or algebraic relationships that might simplify the expression, or check if any approximations or assumptions were intended.

proposed answer: The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency was calculated as 12 in sub-task 3. Since 12 is already an integer, it can be expressed as a fraction 12/1, which is in simplest form. The numerator is 12 and the denominator is 1, both of which are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 12 + 1 = 13.
