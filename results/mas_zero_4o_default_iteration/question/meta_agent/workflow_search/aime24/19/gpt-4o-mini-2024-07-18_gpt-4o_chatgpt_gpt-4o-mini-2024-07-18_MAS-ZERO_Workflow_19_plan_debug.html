Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000..

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent nZRu:
We have the expression (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1 for each k from 0 to 12. Since omega is a 13th root of unity, the polynomial x^13 - 1 = 0 has roots omega^k for k = 0, 1, ..., 12. The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is the value of the polynomial (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x = 1, which is 13. However, we need to consider the expression (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1. This expression is equal to (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1 = 1 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) + 1 = 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k). We need to find the product of these expressions for k = 0 to 12. The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is 13, but we need the product of (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1. This is equivalent to finding the product of (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1 for all k, which is a complicated expression. However, since the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is 13, we can use this to simplify the calculation. The product of (1 - omega^k)^2 for k = 0 to 12 is 13^2, and the product of (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1 is related to this product. However, without further simplification, this calculation is complex, but we can use symmetry and properties of roots of unity to simplify. The product of (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1 is actually related to the polynomial (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at a specific point. Since this is a complex calculation, it is best approached by recognizing symmetry and using the properties of roots of unity. The product simplifies to 13^2, but we need to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000. The remainder of 169 when divided by 1000 is 169.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6Po1 (yourself):
The sub-task 2 already provides the product of the terms as 169. The task now is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. Since 169 is less than 1000, the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000 is simply 169 itself.
