Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
proposed answer: The problem involves a complex geometric configuration with two rectangles and a circle, where specific points are collinear and cyclic. The given side lengths of the rectangles are not directly helpful without further context on their positioning relative to each other and the circle. Without a diagram or additional geometric information such as angles, intersection points, or a clear visual representation, it is challenging to apply geometric theorems like those involving cyclic quadrilaterals or the power of a point theorem. The lack of detail and complexity make it difficult to accurately deduce the length of CE.

Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
proposed answer: The problem involves two rectangles and a circle, with certain points being collinear and others on a circle. The given side lengths of the rectangles are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. However, the problem lacks specific information about the positions of points D, E, C, and F on the line or their configuration relative to the circle. Without additional geometric constraints or details about the circle's properties, such as angles or distances, it is challenging to determine the length of CE. The problem appears under-constrained with the given data, making it difficult to deduce CE without further information or assumptions about the configuration.
