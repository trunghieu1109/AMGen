Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the coordinates of a point C on the line segment AB that does not belong to any unit length segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of C have been determined as \((1/3, \sqrt{3}/6)\). To find \(OC^2\), we use the distance formula from the origin O to point C: \(OC^2 = (1/3)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/6)^2\). Calculating this, we have \(OC^2 = 1/9 + 1/12 = 4/36 + 3/36 = 7/36\). The fraction \(7/36\) is in its simplest form, with relatively prime integers \(p = 7\) and \(q = 36\). Therefore, \(p + q = 7 + 36 = 43\).

Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: The point C on line AB that does not belong to any segment PQ of unit length other than AB itself was determined to be C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). To find OC^2, we use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate OC as sqrt((1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2), which simplifies to sqrt(1/16 + 3/16) = sqrt(4/16) = 1/2. Therefore, OC^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The fraction 1/4 is already in its simplest form, with p = 1 and q = 4, making them relatively prime. Thus, p + q = 1 + 4 = 5.
