    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the fraction representing r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent uUDO:
From the sub-task 3, we have determined that r^2 = 997/144. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 997 and 144 are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is simply 997 + 144.

### thinking by Debate Agent SELF:
From sub-task 3, we have the fraction representing r^2 as 997/144. The problem requires that p and q be relatively prime, which they are, because 997 is a prime number and does not divide 144. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 997 + 144.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the fraction representing r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry.</pre>

    <pre>The fraction representing r^2 is given as 997/144. We need to check if this fraction is in its simplest form. Since 997 is a prime number and does not divide 144, the fraction is already simplified. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 997 + 144.
