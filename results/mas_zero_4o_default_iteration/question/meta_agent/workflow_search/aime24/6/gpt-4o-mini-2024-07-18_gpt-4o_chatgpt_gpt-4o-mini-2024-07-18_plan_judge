Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the dimensions of a rectangular box with a given surface area and volume, and then determining the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The equations 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23 are difficult to solve analytically without additional information or numerical methods. Without the dimensions, we cannot calculate the diagonal of the box, which is necessary to find the radius of the sphere. Therefore, the problem is too complex to solve with the given information.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Provide explicit dimensions of the box that satisfy the constraints or use numerical methods to approximate them. Once dimensions are known, calculate the diagonal, then find r^2 and simplify.

Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
proposed answer: The fraction representing r^2 is given as 997/144. We need to check if this fraction is in its simplest form. Since 997 is a prime number and does not divide 144, the fraction is already simplified. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 997 + 144.
