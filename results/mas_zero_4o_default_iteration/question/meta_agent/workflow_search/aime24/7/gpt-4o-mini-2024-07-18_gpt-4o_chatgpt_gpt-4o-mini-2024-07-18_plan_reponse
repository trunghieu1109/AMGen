Specifically, for x = 100 and y = 10, we have y^x = 10^{100} and x^{10} = 100^{10}, which are equal, satisfying the first equation. For the second equation, x^{4y} = 100^{40} and y^{10} = 10^{10}, which are also equal, satisfying the second equation. Therefore, the product xy is 100 * 10 = 1000.\n\nAnswer:1000",

        "response": "We have already determined that x = 16 and y = 64 satisfy the given logarithmic equations. Therefore, the product xy = 16 * 64. We can calculate this product directly. 16 * 64 is equal to 1024. This calculation is consistent with the reasoning provided in sub-task 2, where these values satisfy both logarithmic equations.\n\nAnswer:1024",
