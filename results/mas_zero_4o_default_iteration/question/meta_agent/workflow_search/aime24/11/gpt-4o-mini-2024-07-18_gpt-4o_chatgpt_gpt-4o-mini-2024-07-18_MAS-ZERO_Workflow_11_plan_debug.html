Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent CZKU:
For each configuration of direction changes, we need to calculate the number of valid paths. Each configuration specifies the number of consecutive right and up moves, and we use combinations to determine how to distribute these moves. For example, for the configuration (1) 2R, 3U, 3R, 5U, 3R, we calculate the number of ways to arrange the segments of moves. The total number of moves is 16, consisting of 8 &#39;R&#39; and 8 &#39;U&#39;. We need to calculate the number of ways to place the segments in the sequence. For configuration (1), we have segments of 2R, 3U, 3R, 5U, 3R. The number of ways to arrange these segments is calculated by considering the number of ways to choose positions for each segment in the 16-move sequence. We use combinations for this calculation.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vhml (yourself):
The sub-task 2 provides the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. We have the numbers 70, 56, 56, 56, and 56 for different configurations. To find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times, we simply sum these numbers together.

[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry.</pre>
