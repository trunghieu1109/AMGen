Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves, with exactly four direction changes. This means there are five segments of moves, alternating between right and up. The possible configurations of these segments must sum to 8 right moves and 8 up moves. For example, a configuration could be 2-3-3-2-3-3, where the numbers represent the number of moves in each segment. Each configuration must be analyzed to determine the number of valid paths, using combinatorial methods to choose positions for each segment. The total number of paths is the sum of the valid paths for each configuration. However, without the specific configurations and their counts from sub-task 2, it's challenging to aggregate the results accurately. The problem requires detailed combinatorial analysis for each configuration, which is complex and involves careful counting of combinations. The previous sub-tasks suggest that there are 140 valid paths for each configuration, but without knowing the number of configurations, we cannot determine the total number of paths.

Answer:140
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes using combinatorial methods, ensuring the total number of right and up moves remains 8 each, and sum the possibilities for each configuration.

proposed answer: The task is to sum the numbers provided in sub-task 2 to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. The numbers given are 70, 56, 56, 56, and 56. By adding these numbers together, we can find the total number of such paths. The sum is 70 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 294.
