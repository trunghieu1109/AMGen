    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, convert \(AP\) into \(rac{m}{n}\) and find \(m + n\). 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent EYW8:
The problem requires using the power of point theorem to find the length of AP. From the given information and previous sub-tasks, we found that AP = 9/2. This fraction is already in its simplest form, where m = 9 and n = 2. These numbers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the task of finding m + n is simply to add these two integers together, which gives us 11.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry.</pre>
