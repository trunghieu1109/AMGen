        "response": "The problem involves finding the length of segment AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle, with tangents intersecting at a point D. The power of a point theorem gives us DA * DP = 81, but without specific values for DA or DP, we cannot directly find AP. The problem likely requires additional geometric insights or properties, such as the circumradius or specific relationships between DA and DP, which are not provided. Without these, the problem is too complex to solve with the given information.\n\nAnswer:81\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Additional geometric insights or properties, such as the circumradius or specific relationships between DA and DP, are needed to determine AP.",

These numbers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is simply 9 + 2, which equals 11.\n\nAnswer:11",
