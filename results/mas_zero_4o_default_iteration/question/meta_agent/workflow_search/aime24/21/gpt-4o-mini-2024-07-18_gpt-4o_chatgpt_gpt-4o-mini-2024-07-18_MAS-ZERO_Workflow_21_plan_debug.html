    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy].

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of rectangles formed by ensuring the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 9TWN:
The task involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon by selecting pairs of parallel lines, which can be either sides or diagonals. A regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry, and its diagonals can be classified based on their lengths and directions. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to 5 other sides, and each diagonal is parallel to 5 other diagonals of the same length. There are 6 sets of parallel lines (3 sets of sides and 3 sets of diagonals). The number of ways to choose 2 sets from these 6 is given by the combination formula C(6, 2) = 15. Each choice of two sets of parallel lines forms exactly one rectangle, as the lines intersect at right angles to form a closed rectangle shape. Therefore, the number of rectangles formed by ensuring the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape is 15. The problem is well-defined, and the geometric analysis provided is sufficient to ensure accuracy.

Each choice of two sets of parallel lines forms exactly one rectangle, as the lines intersect at right angles to form a closed rectangle shape. Therefore, the number of rectangles formed by ensuring the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape is 15. The problem assumes symmetry and the geometric properties of the dodecagon ensure that the selection of any two sets of parallel lines guarantees the formation of a closed rectangle.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the debate results, provide the final count of rectangles.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry.</pre>
