Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon using pairs of parallel lines. According to the debate results from the sub-task, there are 90 possible pairs of parallel lines that can form rectangles. Each rectangle is formed by selecting two pairs of parallel lines, and the count of 90 already considers the valid configurations of parallel lines that result in rectangles. Therefore, the number of rectangles is directly given by these valid pair combinations.

proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon by selecting pairs of parallel lines, which can be either sides or diagonals. A regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry, and its diagonals can be classified based on their lengths and directions. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to 5 other sides, and each diagonal is parallel to 5 other diagonals of the same length. There are 6 sets of parallel lines (3 sets of sides and 3 sets of diagonals). The number of ways to choose 2 sets from these 6 is given by the combination formula C(6, 2) = 15. Each choice of two sets of parallel lines forms exactly one rectangle, as the lines intersect at right angles to form a closed rectangle shape. Therefore, the number of rectangles formed by ensuring the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape is 15. The problem is well-defined, and the geometric analysis provided is sufficient to ensure accuracy.
