proposed answer: To distinguish between two quantum states with lifetimes of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, we can use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. The longer lifetime corresponds to a smaller uncertainty in energy. For the state with a lifetime of 10^-9 sec, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 * 10^-9 sec). Given that ħ is approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 J·s, we can calculate ΔE for the shorter lifetime. This gives us an energy uncertainty of about 5.27 x 10^-26 J, which is equivalent to about 3.29 x 10^-9 eV. To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than this uncertainty. Among the options provided, 10^-8 eV is the only choice that exceeds this uncertainty, making it the most suitable option for clearly distinguishing the two energy levels.
