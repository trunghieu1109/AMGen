For |sin(2πx)| = 0.25, we have sin(2πx) = ±0.25. Solving 2πx = arcsin(0.25) + 2kπ and 2πx = π - arcsin(0.25) + 2kπ for integer k gives x = (1/12 + k) and x = (5/12 + k). For |sin(2πx)| = 0.5, we have sin(2πx) = ±0.5. Solving 2πx = π/6 + 2kπ and 2πx = 5π/6 + 2kπ gives x = (1/6 + k) and x = (1/3 + k). For |cos(3πy)| = 0.25, we have cos(3πy) = ±0.25. Solving 3πy = arccos(0.25) + 2kπ and 3πy = 2π - arccos(0.25) + 2kπ gives y = (1/9 + k) and y = (7/9 + k). For |cos(3πy)| = 0.5, we have cos(3πy) = ±0.5. Solving 3πy = π/3 + 2kπ and 3πy = 5π/3 + 2kπ gives y = (1/6 + k) and y = (5/6 + k).

From Subtask 2, we know these piecewise functions are determined by the critical breakpoints derived in Subtask 1. For g(f(sin(2πx))), we have breakpoints at x = 1/12, 5/12, 1/6, and 1/3. For g(f(cos(3πy))), we have breakpoints at y = 1/9, 7/9, 1/6, and 5/6. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| changes behavior at x = ±1/2, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| changes behavior at x = ±1/4. We consider the intervals created by these breakpoints and evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) for each interval. The function g(f(sin(2πx))) is piecewise linear across these intervals due to the absolute value operations. After determining the piecewise functions, we apply the 4× scaling by multiplying each piece by 4. This scaling affects the range of the function, stretching it vertically by a factor of 4.

The piecewise nature of these functions means they are linear on certain intervals, and we must consider each possible pair of intervals for x and y. We solve the linear equations for each pair and check if the solution falls within the domain constraints of both intervals. The critical breakpoints for x are at 1/12, 5/12, 1/6, and 1/3, while for y they are at 1/9, 7/9, 1/6, and 5/6. For each pair of intervals, we solve the linear equations to find candidate intersection points. We then verify these points to ensure they lie within the specified intervals for both x and y.

Each piecewise segment corresponds to a linear function over a specific interval of x or y. We solve for intersections by setting y = 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) equal to x and x = 4·g(f(cos(3πy))) equal to y, which gives us a system of two linear equations in two variables (x, y). We solve this system for each pair of linear segments from the functions. Each solution gives a candidate intersection point. However, we must verify that each candidate point lies within the domain constraints specified by the intervals for the piecewise segments.

Each linear segment of y = 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) corresponds to a linear equation in terms of x, and each segment of x = 4·g(f(cos(3πy))) corresponds to a linear equation in terms of y. To find intersections, we solve these linear equations simultaneously for each pair of branches. For each solution (x, y), we must check that x and y fall within the specific intervals defined by the breakpoints for the respective branches. If a solution satisfies the domain constraints for both x and y, it is a valid intersection point.

The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| has breakpoints at x = ±1/2. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| has breakpoints at x = ±1/4. For g(f(sin(2πx))), we consider the values of |sin(2πx)| at the breakpoints x = 1/12, 5/12, 1/6, 1/3. Similarly, for g(f(cos(3πy))), we consider the values of |cos(3πy)| at the breakpoints y = 1/9, 7/9, 1/6, 5/6. We then evaluate f and g at these points to determine the piecewise behavior. For example, if |sin(2πx)| < 1/4, then f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, and g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - |1/2 - |sin(2πx)||. We repeat this process for each interval determined by the breakpoints to derive the complete piecewise formulas.\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent aSjn:\\nThe piecewise formulas for g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are derived by evaluating the functions at the critical breakpoints and considering the intervals between them. For g(f(sin(2πx))), the intervals are determined by x = 1/12, 5/12, 1/6, 1/3, and for g(f(cos(3πy))), the intervals are determined by y = 1/9, 7/9, 1/6, 5/6. The explicit piecewise formulas depend on the behavior of f and g at these points.\\n\\n### Subtask 1: Identify all critical breakpoints by solving |sin(2πx)|=0.25,0.5 and |cos(3πy)|=0.25,0.5, and verify the correctness of these breakpoints against the problem constraints. \\n\\n ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ondu:\\nTo identify the critical breakpoints, we solve the equations |sin(2πx)| = 0.25, 0.5 and |cos(3πy)| = 0.25, 0.5. For |sin(2πx)| = 0.25, we have sin(2πx) = ±0.25. Solving 2πx = arcsin(0.25) + 2kπ and 2πx = π - arcsin(0.25) + 2kπ for integer k gives x = (1/12 + k) and x = (5/12 + k). For |sin(2πx)| = 0.5, we have sin(2πx) = ±0.5. Solving 2πx = π/6 + 2kπ and 2πx = 5π/6 + 2kπ gives x = (1/6 + k) and x = (1/3 + k). For |cos(3πy)| = 0.25, we have cos(3πy) = ±0.25. Solving 3πy = arccos(0.25) + 2kπ and 3πy = 2π - arccos(0.25) + 2kπ gives y = (1/9 + k) and y = (7/9 + k). For |cos(3πy)| = 0.5, we have cos(3πy) = ±0.5. Solving 3πy = π/3 + 2kπ and 3πy = 5π/3 + 2kπ gives y = (1/6 + k) and y = (5/6 + k).
