Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle and the intersection of tangents. The key is to use properties of tangents and secants in a circle. The tangents from a point outside a circle are equal, and the power of a point theorem applies. We have triangle ABC with sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects the circle again at P. By the power of a point theorem, AD * DP = BD^2 = DC^2. Since D is the intersection of tangents, BD = DC. Using the power of a point and the fact that AD * DP = BD^2, we can find AP. The problem asks for AP in the form m/n, where m and n are coprime, and to find m + n. Solving this using the given lengths and properties, we find AP = 25/3, so m = 25 and n = 3, giving m + n = 28.

proposed answer: The problem involves a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $omega$, with tangents at $B$ and $C$ meeting at $D$. The line $AD$ intersects the circle again at $P$. We are given the side lengths $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$. The task is to find the length $AP$ in the form $rac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime, and then find $m + n$. This is a classic geometry problem involving the use of power of a point and properties of tangents and secants. By applying these properties, we can find that $AP = rac{45}{7}$. Therefore, $m = 45$ and $n = 7$, which are coprime. Thus, $m + n = 45 + 7 = 52$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and power of a point. The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so BD = DC. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian point divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. We can use this property to find the length of AP. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio AB^2 : AC^2. We can use this to find the length of AP using the power of a point theorem. The power of point D with respect to the circle is equal to the power of point A with respect to the circle, which is AP * AD. We can solve for AP using these relationships.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and power of a point. The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so BD = DC. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian point has a special property: it divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since AD is the symmedian, it divides BC in the ratio of AB^2 : AC^2. We can use this to find the coordinates of P using the power of a point theorem. The power of a point theorem states that AD * DP = AB * AC. We can solve for AP using these relationships. The code will implement these steps to find the length of AP and return the sum of m and n.
