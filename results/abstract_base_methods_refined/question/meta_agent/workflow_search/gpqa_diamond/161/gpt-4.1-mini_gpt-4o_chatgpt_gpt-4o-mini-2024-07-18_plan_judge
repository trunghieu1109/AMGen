proposed answer: The integral for the total area of the pseudosphere is set up as A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32r}{4-r^2} dr d\theta. Evaluating the inner integral \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32r}{4-r^2} dr, we notice that the integrand has a singularity at r = 2, which is the upper limit of integration. This suggests that the integral may diverge. Indeed, as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, causing the integrand to approach infinity. Therefore, the integral \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32r}{4-r^2} dr is divergent, leading to an infinite area. This corresponds to choice A) +\infty in the given multiple-choice options.
