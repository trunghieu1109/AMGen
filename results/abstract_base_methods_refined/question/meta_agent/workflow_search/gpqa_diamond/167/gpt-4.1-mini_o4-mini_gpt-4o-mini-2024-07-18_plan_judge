Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_167
proposed answer: The top stealthy error sources in genomics data analysis are: 1) the “chr”/“no chr” naming mismatch (issue 2), and 2) incorrect ID conversion (issue 4). Neither exact combination “2 and 4” nor “3 and 4” nor “2 and 3” alone is offered. Option C (“All of the above”) overstates by including incompatible formats, which are less frequent. The only choice that includes both issue 2 and issue 4 is D (“2, 3 and 4”), making it the best available answer.

proposed answer: The integrated findings from Subtask 6 ranked all four listed issues—mutually incompatible data formats, the “chr”/“no chr” confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion—as common and often hard-to-spot sources of erroneous results in genomics data analysis. While incompatible formats and chr/no-chr confusion were the most frequent, reference mismatches and ID conversion errors remained significant contributors. Among the provided options, only “All of the above” (choice C) encompasses all four identified error sources, matching our comprehensive assessment. Other options omit one or more of these key issues, making them incomplete representations of the major error sources.
