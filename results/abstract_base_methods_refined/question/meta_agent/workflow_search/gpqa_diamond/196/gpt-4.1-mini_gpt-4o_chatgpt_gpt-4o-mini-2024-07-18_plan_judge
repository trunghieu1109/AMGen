proposed answer: All agents agree that Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid based on the IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1, indicative of a carboxylic acid O-H stretch, and a peak at 1720 cm-1, characteristic of a C=O stretch in carboxylic acids. The NMR data supports this structure with a deshielded peak at 10.5 ppm corresponding to the carboxylic acid proton. Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes, typically by converting the carboxylic acid group into an alkyl iodide, which is then further reduced to an alkane. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group is transformed into a methyl group, while the aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group remain unchanged. This results in the formation of 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.

Answer:1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene
Extracted answer: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: The validated predicted final product structure is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Comparing this with the multiple-choice options: 1) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene matches exactly with the predicted structure. 2) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid contains a carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the expected reduction to a hydrocarbon. 3) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid has an additional propanoic acid group and an ethyl substituent, which does not match the predicted structure. 4) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has an isobutyl group instead of a sec-butyl group, making it structurally different from the predicted product. Therefore, the best match for the validated predicted final product structure is choice 1, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which corresponds to option A.
