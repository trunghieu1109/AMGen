Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The decarboxylation of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus/HI removes the –COOH, leaving only the sec-butyl substituent on benzene, i.e. sec-butylbenzene. Among the choices, the only one that corresponds to a benzene ring bearing a single sec-butyl group (with no extra COOH or other substituents) is A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene if the methyl is actually the ring hydrogen (misnamed), which best matches sec-butylbenzene. Choices B, C, and D either retain the acid or introduce extra groups that are not present.
