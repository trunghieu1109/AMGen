        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The IR shows a very broad band from 3400\u20132500 cm\u207b\u00b9, characteristic of hydrogen-bonded O\u2013H stretches in carboxylic acids. The sharp, strong absorption at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 corresponds to a C=O stretch, consistent with a carbonyl (and in combination with the broad O\u2013H, specifically a carboxylic acid). The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm\u207b\u00b9 are typical aromatic C=C stretches, indicating a benzene ring. No other strong characteristic absorptions appear, so the major functional groups are an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid.; answer - Compound X contains a carboxylic acid functional group (broad O\u2013H stretch at 3400\u20132500 cm\u207b\u00b9 and C=O stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9) and an aromatic ring (C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm\u207b\u00b9).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The 1H NMR shows a total of 14 H, consistent with a para-substituted benzoic acid bearing a sec-butyl group. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is the carboxylic acid proton. The two aromatic doublets at 8.0 ppm (d, J\u22488 Hz, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, J\u22488 Hz, 2H) indicate an AA\u2032BB\u2032 pattern of a para-disubstituted benzene. In the aliphatic region, the multiplet at 2.9 ppm integrates to 1H, characteristic of the methine proton in the sec-butyl moiety (\u2013CH(CH3)\u2013). The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) corresponds to the adjacent methylene (\u2013CH2\u2013). The doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, J\u22486 Hz, 3H) is the methyl group attached to the sec-butyl methine, and the triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, J\u22487 Hz, 3H) is the terminal methyl of the butyl chain.; answer - 10.5 ppm, bs, 1H \u2013 COOH proton; 8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H \u2013 aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene; 2.9 ppm, m, 1H \u2013 sec-butyl methine proton; 1.7 ppm, m, 2H \u2013 sec-butyl methylene; 1.4 ppm, d, 3H \u2013 methyl on sec-butyl carbon; 0.9 ppm, t, 3H \u2013 terminal methyl of the butyl chain.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The IR spectrum shows a broad 3400\u20132500 cm\u207b\u00b9 band and a sharp 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak, diagnostic of a hydrogen-bonded O\u2013H and C=O of a carboxylic acid. Peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicate an aromatic ring. The \u00b9H NMR has a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) for COOH, two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (each 2H, J\u22488 Hz) consistent with an AA\u2032BB\u2032 pattern of a para-disubstituted benzene, and aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which match a sec-butyl group. Together these data uniquely support 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid as the structure of Compound X.; answer - 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Red P/HI is a strong reducing system that converts \u2013COOH into a C\u2013H via reductive decarboxylation. In this case, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X) first forms the acyl iodide and then undergoes radical decarboxylation to release CO\u2082 and furnish the hydrocarbon. The sec-butyl substituent on the ring is untouched, so the net transformation is loss of the carboxyl group, yielding sec-butylbenzene.; answer - sec-butylbenzene\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Red phosphorus and HI is a classic radical de-carboxylation system (Hunsdiecker\u2013Barton reduction). First, the benzoic acid\u2019s \u2013COOH is converted in situ to an acyl iodide, which then undergoes homolysis to generate a carboxyl radical. Loss of CO\u2082 gives an aryl radical that abstracts H\u00b7, yielding the hydrocarbon. Since Compound X is 4\u2010(sec\u2010butyl)benzoic acid, the para\u2010sec\u2010butyl substituent remains intact, and the carboxyl group is removed, producing sec-butylbenzene.; answer - sec-butylbenzene\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The decarboxylation of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus/HI removes the \u2013COOH, leaving only the sec-butyl substituent on benzene, i.e. sec-butylbenzene. Among the choices, the only one that corresponds to a benzene ring bearing a single sec-butyl group (with no extra COOH or other substituents) is A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene if the methyl is actually the ring hydrogen (misnamed), which best matches sec-butylbenzene. Choices B, C, and D either retain the acid or introduce extra groups that are not present.; answer - A"
