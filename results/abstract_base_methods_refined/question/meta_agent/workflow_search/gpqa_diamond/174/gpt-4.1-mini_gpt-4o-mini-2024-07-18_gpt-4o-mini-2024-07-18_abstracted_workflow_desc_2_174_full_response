In the case of a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution that is symmetric about the z-axis, the contributions to the dipole moment from positive and negative charges will cancel each other out. This is because for every positive charge at a position (x, y, z), there is an equal negative charge at (-x, -y, -z), leading to a net dipole moment of zero.

For a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, the dipole moment can be calculated by integrating the charge density multiplied by the position vector over the volume of the distribution. Due to the symmetry of the spheroid, where the positive and negative charges are evenly distributed about the center, the contributions to the dipole moment from opposite sides of the spheroid will cancel each other out.
