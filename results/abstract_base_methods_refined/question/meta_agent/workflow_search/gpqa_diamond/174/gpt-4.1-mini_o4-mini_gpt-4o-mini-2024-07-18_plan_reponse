The spheroidal shape implies an axisymmetric distribution, so the radiation pattern depends only on \u03b8. The wavelength \u03bb sets the scale of angular variation in f(\u03bb,\u03b8). Thus the setup is a time-varying, axisymmetric source radiating at wavelength \u03bb, and we measure power per solid angle as a function of \u03b8 relative to the symmetry axis.; answer - The source is an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. It radiates electromagnetic waves at wavelength \u03bb, and in the far (radiation) zone the power per unit solid angle depends on \u03bb and the polar angle \u03b8 measured from the z-axis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry about z behaves like an electric dipole along z in the far field. The angular dependence of dipole radiation is sin\u00b2\u03b8, since radiation is zero on the axis and maximal in the equatorial plane. The frequency dependence arises from the time\u2010varying dipole moment \u00a8p\u221d\u03c9\u00b2, giving fields \u221d\u03c9\u00b2 and power \u221d|E|\u00b2\u221d\u03c9\u2074. Since \u03c9=2\u03c0c/\u03bb, power \u221d\u03bb\u207b\u2074.

The angular dependence of the power per unit solid angle is sin\u00b2\u03b8 (zero on axis, maximum at \u03b8=90\u00b0). The frequency dependence comes from p\u0308\u221d\u03c9\u00b2 so E\u221d\u03c9\u00b2, giving power \u221d|E|\u00b2\u221d\u03c9\u2074. Since \u03c9=2\u03c0c/\u03bb, this yields a \u03bb\u207b\u2074 scaling. Combining these gives f(\u03bb,\u03b8)\u221dsin\u00b2\u03b8/\u03bb\u2074.; answer - f(\u03bb, \u03b8) \u221d sin\u00b2\u03b8 / \u03bb\u2074\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3 we have f(\u03bb,\u03b8)\u221dsin\u00b2\u03b8/\u03bb\u2074. The maximum of sin\u00b2\u03b8 is 1 at \u03b8=90\u00b0, so the peak radiated power A occurs at \u03b8=90\u00b0 and scales as A\u221d1/\u03bb\u2074. At \u03b8=30\u00b0, sin\u00b230\u00b0=(1/2)\u00b2=1/4, so f(\u03bb,30\u00b0)=A\u00d7(1/4). Hence the radiated power at 30\u00b0 is one-quarter of the maximum A.; answer - The maximum radiated power A occurs at \u03b8=90\u00b0 (sin\u00b2\u03b8=1), and at \u03b8=30\u00b0 the power is A/4 (one-quarter of A).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the dipole\u2010radiation formula we have f(\u03bb,\u03b8)\u221dsin\u00b2\u03b8\u00b7\u03c9\u2074, where \u03c9=2\u03c0c/\u03bb. The radiated electric field scales like E\u221dp\u0308\u221d\u03c9\u00b2, so the power per unit solid angle goes as |E|\u00b2\u221d\u03c9\u2074.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The user\u2019s sub-task asks for a description of the oscillating charge distribution setup. We know from the original problem statement that the charge distribution is a spheroid with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. It oscillates at some frequency so it radiates electromagnetic waves of wavelength \u03bb. In the far (radiation) zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle depends on the emission angle \u03b8 relative to the z-axis and on \u03bb. This matches the typical analysis of an oscillating multipole (here a spheroidal dipole\u2010like source) where geometry, symmetry axis, and radiation parameters must be specified.; answer - The charge distribution is a spheroid whose symmetry axis is aligned with the z-axis. It oscillates at a frequency corresponding to a radiation wavelength \u03bb. In the far field, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on \u03bb and on the angle \u03b8 measured from the z-axis along which the spheroid\u2019s symmetry is defined.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The spheroidal charge oscillation is symmetric about the z\u2013axis and undergoes volume\u2010preserving distortions, so its net oscillating dipole moment vanishes. The first surviving time\u2010varying moment is therefore the electric quadrupole.  In the far zone its radiation power scales as the square of the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment, giving P\u221d\u03c96\u221d\u03bb\u22126, and the angular distribution for an axis\u2010aligned Qzz is \u221d(sin\u03b8\u2009cos\u03b8)2.; answer - The lowest nonzero multipole is the electric quadrupole moment, which radiates with P\u221d\u03bb\u22126 and angular dependence \u221dsin2\u03b8\u2009cos2\u03b8.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The spheroid\u2019s oscillation preserves charge symmetry about its center, so its net oscillating dipole moment is identically zero. Dipole radiation would require a nonzero first moment and predicts P\u221d\u03c9\u2074\u221d\u03bb\u207b\u2074 with a sin\u00b2\u03b8 pattern, which contradicts the \u03bb\u207b\u2076 scaling and sin\u00b2\u03b8\u2009cos\u00b2\u03b8 angular dependence found from Sub-task 2. The leading nonzero time-varying moment is the electric quadrupole, whose second time derivative gives power P\u221d\u03c9\u2076\u221d\u03bb\u207b\u2076 and an angular distribution \u221d(sin\u03b8\u2009cos\u03b8)\u00b2, exactly matching the observed f(\u03bb,\u03b8) and the fraction at \u03b8=30\u00b0. Therefore the electric quadrupole model is the correct radiation description for the oscillating spheroid.; answer - Quadrupole radiation model\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The oscillating spheroid has no net dipole moment, so its leading radiation arises from the time\u2010varying electric quadrupole. The power radiated by a quadrupole scales as the square of the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment, yielding P\u221d\u03c9^6. Since \u03c9=2\u03c0c/\u03bb, this gives a \u03bb^\u22126 dependence. The standard angular distribution for a zz\u2010aligned electric quadrupole is proportional to (sin\u2009\u03b8\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8)^2. To express f(\u03bb,\u03b8) in terms of A, the maximum power per unit solid angle, we note that (sin\u2009\u03b8\u2009cos\u2009\u03b8)^2 reaches 1/4 at \u03b8=45\u00b0, so setting f(\u03bb,45\u00b0)=A gives the normalization factor: k\u00b7(1/4)\u00b7\u03bb^\u22126=A \u21d2 k=4A.

Thus the power at 30\u00b0 is 3/4 of the maximum A.; answer - 3/4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The derived expression for the radiated power per unit solid angle is f(\u03bb,\u03b8) = 4A\u2009sin^2\u03b8\u2009cos^2\u03b8\u2009\u03bb^\u22126. Here the only \u03bb-dependence is in the factor \u03bb^\u22126. This comes directly from the quadrupole radiation scaling: P \u221d \u03c9^6 and \u03c9 = 2\u03c0c/\u03bb, so P \u221d (1/\u03bb)^6 = \u03bb^\u22126.
