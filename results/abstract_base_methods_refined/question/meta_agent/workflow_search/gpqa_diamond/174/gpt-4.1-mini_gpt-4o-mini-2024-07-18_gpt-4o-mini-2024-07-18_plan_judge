Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_174
proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, we evaluated that the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of theta = 30 degrees is 1/4, and the corresponding wavelength dependence is lambda^(-4). This directly matches with choice 3 from the original question, which states '1/4, \lambda^(-4)'. Therefore, based on this evaluation and the matching of both the fraction and the wavelength dependence, the correct answer to Sub-task 6 is clearly identified as choice 3.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_174
proposed answer: The evaluated fraction of maximum power radiated at θ = 30 degrees is 1/4, as derived from the dipole radiation pattern. The corresponding wavelength dependence is λ^(-4), indicating that the power radiated decreases with the fourth power of the wavelength. Among the provided options, the choice that matches both the fraction of 1/4 and the wavelength dependence of λ^(-4) is choice 3.
