Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_174
proposed answer: From Sub-task 4 we found f(λ,θ)∝sin²θ/λ⁴, giving at θ=30° a factor sin²30°=1/4 of the peak A, and from Sub-task 5 the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴. Among the choices, only choice 3) or C) gives 1/4 and λ⁻⁴.

proposed answer: We found in Sub-task 5b that the radiated power at θ=30° is 3/4 of the maximum A. In Sub-task 6 we determined that the wavelength dependence in f(λ,θ) is λ^(−6). Matching these two results to the given choices: A) 1/2, λ^(−4); B) 3/4, λ^(−6); C) 1/4, λ^(−4); D) 1/4, λ^(−3), only option B has the correct fraction (3/4) and the correct exponent (−6), so the correct answer is B).
