proposed answer: All debate agents agree that the function for radiated power per unit solid angle is f(λ, θ) = λ^{-4} * sin^2(θ). The maximum power A is radiated at θ = 90°, where sin^2(90°) = 1. At θ = 30°, sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, meaning the power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4. The wavelength dependence from the function f(λ, θ) is λ^{-4}. This matches choice 3, which is 1/4, λ^{-4}. All agents consistently reached this conclusion, confirming its correctness.

proposed answer: The derived function for the radiation pattern is consistent with dipole radiation, which has a power distribution proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \) and an angular dependence of \( \cos^2(\theta) \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \cos^2(30^\circ) = (\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 3/4 \). This means the fraction of maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 3/4 \). The wavelength dependence \( \lambda^{-4} \) is also consistent with dipole radiation. Comparing this with the multiple-choice options, choice B) '3/4, \lambda^{-6}' has the correct fraction but incorrect wavelength dependence, while choice C) '1/4, \lambda^{-4}' has the correct wavelength dependence but incorrect fraction. Therefore, the correct choice that matches both the fraction and the wavelength dependence is not explicitly listed, but the closest match based on the fraction is choice B).
