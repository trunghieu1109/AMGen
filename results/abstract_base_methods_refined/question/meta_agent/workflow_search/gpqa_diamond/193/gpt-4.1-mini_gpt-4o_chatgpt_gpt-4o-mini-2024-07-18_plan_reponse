The possible configurations are: (+1, +1, +1), (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1), (-1, -1, -1).; answer - (+1, +1, +1), (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1), (-1, -1, -1)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the energy E for each spin configuration, we use the formula E = -J (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3). We will substitute each of the spin configurations into this formula. For each configuration, we compute the product of the spins as needed and then substitute into the energy formula. The configurations and their corresponding energies are as follows: \n1. (+1, +1, +1): E = -J((+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)) = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n2.
