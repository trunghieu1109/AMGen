Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_15_193
proposed answer: All agents have independently verified that the computed partition function Z is Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ). This matches exactly with choice 1 in the original question, which is 'Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)'. Therefore, the consensus among all agents is that choice 1 is the correct answer. The consistent agreement among the agents and the exact match with the computed result provide strong justification for selecting choice 1 as the correct partition function.
