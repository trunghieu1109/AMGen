From Sub‐task 5 we have [Co2+] ≈ 4.228×10^–3 M, [SCN–] = 0.1 M, and β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Compute the bracketed term: 1 + 9·0.1 + 40·(0.1)^2 + 63·(0.1)^3 + 16·(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Therefore c(Co)_total = 4.228×10^–3 M × 2.3646 ≈ 1.00×10^–2 M, which confirms the original total cobalt concentration.; answer: 1.00×10⁻² M\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent nkgV, calculate total cobalt species concentration, thinking: To find the total [Co]sum, we add the free Co2+ plus all complex species:  \nGiven [Co2+] = 4.228×10^-3 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M,  \n[CoSCN+] = β1·[Co2+]·[SCN-] = 9·4.228×10^-3·0.1 = 3.8052×10^-3 M  \n[Co(SCN)2] = β2·[Co2+]·[SCN-]^2 = 40·4.228×10^-3·0.01 = 1.6912×10^-3 M  \n[Co(SCN)3]- = β3·[Co2+]·[SCN-]^3 = 63·4.228×10^-3·0.001 = 2.6636×10^-4 M  \n[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4·[Co2+]·[SCN-]^4 = 16·4.228×10^-3·0.0001 = 6.7648×10^-6 M  \nSumming: 4.228×10^-3 + 3.8052×10^-3 + 1.6912×10^-3 + 2.6636×10^-4 + 6.7648×10^-6 ≈ 9.998×10^-3 M ≈ 1.00×10^-2 M, which matches the analytical total cobalt concentration.; answer: 9.998×10^-3 M\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent cHkJ, calculate percentage of dithiocyanato complex, thinking: We have [Co(SCN)2] = 1.69 × 10^-3 M and the total cobalt concentration = 0.01 M. The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is given by ([Co(SCN)2] / [Co]total) × 100 = (1.69 × 10^-3 M / 0.01 M) × 100 = 16.9%.; answer: 16.9%\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent ejly, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation of 16.9% ([Co(SCN)₂] = 1.69×10⁻³ M divided by total [Co] = 1.00×10⁻² M) is arithmetically correct. However, it assumes ideal behavior (neglecting activity coefficients and ionic strength effects) and that only the four cobalt–thiocyanate species form. In reality, nonideal solution behavior and possible minor side reactions or higher‐order species could shift the equilibrium and alter the true percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.; answer: 16.9%\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent cHkJ, refining percentage calculation, thinking: To find the fraction of Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt species, we take the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂] = 1.69×10⁻³ M, divide by the total cobalt concentration, [Co]ₜₒₜ = 1.00×10⁻² M, and multiply by 100%:\n\nFraction (%) = (1.69×10⁻³ M / 1.00×10⁻² M) × 100% = 16.9%.\n\nThis calculation assumes ideal solution behavior (activity coefficients ≈1) and that only the four Co–SCN complexes (n = 1–4) form. In real solutions, ionic strength effects, non-ideal activities, or minor side reactions could shift equilibria slightly, but under typical analytical conditions these effects are small, so 16.9% is a valid estimate.; answer: 16.9%\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent zw7p, round 0, select correct answer choice, thinking: The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is 16.9%.
