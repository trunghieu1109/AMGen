        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question asks to identify and understand each symbol in the Hamiltonian H=\u03b5\u2009\u03c3\u00b7n. We recall that \u03c3=(\u03c3_x,\u03c3_y,\u03c3_z) are the Pauli matrices acting on a spin-1/2 space, n is any unit vector in real 3-space defining a direction (e.g. of a magnetic field or quantization axis), and \u03b5 is a constant with dimensions of energy setting the overall scale of the Hamiltonian (and hence the energy splitting). Because \u03c3\u00b7n=n_x\u03c3_x+n_y\u03c3_y+n_z\u03c3_z is Hermitian with eigenvalues \u00b11, H has eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5.; answer - H = \u03b5\u2009\u03c3\u00b7n, where \u03b5 is an energy\u2010scale constant, \u03c3=(\u03c3_x,\u03c3_y,\u03c3_z) are the Pauli spin matrices for a spin-\u00bd system, and n is an arbitrary unit vector defining the quantization direction.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to summarize the main algebraic and spectral properties of the Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, and explain how they act on spin-\u00bd states. From sub-task 1 we know \u03c3\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b11, which already tells us that each \u03c3_i by itself has eigenvalues \u00b11. We also recall that the Pauli matrices are 2\u00d72, Hermitian, traceless, square to the identity, and satisfy specific commutation and anticommutation relations. Their eigenvectors define the spin up/down states along the corresponding axis. By compiling these facts, we can fully characterize their action on a generic two-component spinor.; answer - The three Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z are 2\u00d72 Hermitian, traceless operators acting on a spin-\u00bd Hilbert space.  Key properties:\n1. Spectra: Each \u03c3_i has eigenvalues +1 and \u20131.  Its normalized eigenvectors are the \u201cspin up\u201d and \u201cspin down\u201d states along the i-axis.\n2. Squaring: \u03c3_i^2 = I (the 2\u00d72 identity), hence (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = n_x^2+ n_y^2+ n_z^2 = 1 for any unit vector n.\n3. Commutation and anticommutation:\n   \u2022 [\u03c3_i,\u03c3_j] = 2i \u03b5_{ijk} \u03c3_k  (generates SU(2) Lie algebra)\n   \u2022 {\u03c3_i,\u03c3_j} = 2\u03b4_{ij} I\n4. Action on spinors: If |\u00b1_i\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_i with eigenvalues \u00b11, then \u03c3_i |\u00b1_i\u27e9 = \u00b1|\u00b1_i\u27e9.  For a general spinor |\u03c8\u27e9, \u03c3\u00b7n projects onto the axis defined by n, splitting |\u03c8\u27e9 into components with eigenvalues \u00b11.  Hence H=\u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n has energies \u00b1\u03b5.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From H=\u03b5\u2009\u03c3\u00b7n and the definition S=(\u0127/2)\u03c3, substitute \u03c3=2S/\u0127 into H: H=\u03b5\u2009(2S/\u0127)\u00b7n=(2\u03b5/\u0127)(S\u00b7n). In the basis of spin along n, S\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2, so H|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9=(2\u03b5/\u0127)(\u00b1\u0127/2)|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9=\u00b1\u03b5\u2009|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9, recovering the known spin-\u00bd eigenvalue problem.; answer - H = (2\u03b5/\u0127)\n(S \u00b7 n), with eigenvalue equation H|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9 = \u00b1\u03b5\u2009|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9 since S\u00b7n|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9 = \u00b1(\u0127/2)|\u03c8\u00b1\u27e9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we know each Pauli matrix \u03c3_i has eigenvalues \u00b11 and for any unit vector n, \u03c3\u00b7n also has eigenvalues \u00b11. Scaling the operator by \u03b5 multiplies its eigenvalues by \u03b5.; answer - The eigenvalues of H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The Hamiltonian H=\u03b5\u2009\u03c3\u00b7n has eigenvalues given by \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. Since \u03c3\u00b7n (being a Pauli spin operator along a unit vector) has eigenvalues \u00b11, H has eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. Among the choices, only A) +\u03b5, \u2013\u03b5 matches these values exactly, with correct units and no extra \u0127 factors.; answer - A)"
