Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The calculated eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n are ±ε. In the provided multiple-choice options, the choice that matches these eigenvalues is '+ ε, -ε'. This is because the eigenvalues represent the energy levels of the system, and the other options involve factors of ħ or different constants that do not match the derived eigenvalues. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that directly corresponds to ±ε.
