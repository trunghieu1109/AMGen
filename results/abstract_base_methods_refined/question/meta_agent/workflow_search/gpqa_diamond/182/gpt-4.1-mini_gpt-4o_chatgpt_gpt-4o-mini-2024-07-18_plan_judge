Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_37_182
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product as 1. The multiple-choice options provided are 1, 3, 0, and 5. Since the calculated IHD value of 1 matches the first option, the correct choice corresponding to the product's IHD is option 1. Therefore, the answer is choice A), which corresponds to the calculated IHD value of 1.

Answer:A)
Extracted answer: A)
