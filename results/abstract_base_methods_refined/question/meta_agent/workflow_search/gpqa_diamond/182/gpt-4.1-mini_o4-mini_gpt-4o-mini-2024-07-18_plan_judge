Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_182
proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we determined the product has formula C₁₀H₁₆ (after reduction), giving IHD = C – H/2 + 1 = 10 – 16/2 + 1 = 3. Comparing this to the options (A) 1, (B) 3, (C) 0, (D) 5, the correct match is 3, which corresponds to choice B.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_182
proposed answer: The product from Sub-task 5 has molecular formula C9H18, so IHD = (2×9 + 2 − 18) / 2 = 1. The given options are A) 1, B) 3, C) 0, and D) 5. Only A) matches the calculated IHD of 1, so the correct choice is A).
