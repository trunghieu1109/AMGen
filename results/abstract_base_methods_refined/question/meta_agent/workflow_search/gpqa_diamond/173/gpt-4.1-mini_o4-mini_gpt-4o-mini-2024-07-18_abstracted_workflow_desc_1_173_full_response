The key data are: the rest-mass energy of the original nucleus, the mass ratio of the two fission fragments, and the fact that the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the original mass.

Let M2\u2009=\u2009x, then M1\u2009=\u20092x. So 2x+x=3x=0.99\u2009M ⇒ x=0.33\u2009M. Hence M2=0.33\u2009M and M1=2×0.33\u2009M=0.66\u2009M.; answer - M1 = 0.66\u2009M, M2 = 0.33\u2009M\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The initial nucleus has rest energy M c^2 = 300\u2009GeV. From sub-task 2, the two fragments’ rest masses sum to 0.99\u2009M, so the mass defect is ΔM = M – 0.99\u2009M = 0.01\u2009M.

Let the fragment masses be m1 and m2 with m1=2\u2009m2 and m1+m2=0.99\u2009M=297\u2009GeV, so m2=99\u2009GeV, m1=198\u2009GeV. By momentum conservation p1=−p2=p and by energy conservation E1+E2=300\u2009GeV with E1=√(p²+m1²), E2=√(p²+m2²). Thus √(p²+198²)+√(p²+99²)=300.

In a classical two‐body split at rest, the fragments recoil with equal and opposite momenta p. Their kinetic energies are T1 = p²/(2M1) and T2 = p²/(2M2). The sum T1+T2 = ΔE gives p² = 2ΔE/(1/M1 + 1/M2). Substituting back, T1 = ΔE·(1/M1)/(1/M1 + 1/M2) = ΔE·[1/(1 + M1/M2)]. Here M1 = mass of the more massive fragment = 2m, M2 = m. Thus M1/M2 = 2, so T1 = ΔE·1/(1+2) = ΔE/3 = 3 GeV/3 = 1 GeV.

Hence M₂=(0.99/3)M and M₁=2·(0.99/3)M.; answer: M₁ = (2/3)×0.99\u2009M = 0.66\u2009M,  M₂ = (1/3)×0.99\u2009M = 0.33\u2009M\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xM3E, express rest masses in terms of M, thinking: We have M1:M2=2:1 and M1+M2=0.99M.

Momentum conservation (initial p=0) ⇒ p1=p2=p. Relativistic energies: E_i=√(p^2c^2+m_i^2c^4). Thus √(p^2+198^2)+√(p^2+99^2)=300.

Thus m1=0.66M=198\u2009GeV, m2=0.33M=99\u2009GeV. The total kinetic energy available is ΔE=3\u2009GeV= T1+T2.

In a classical two‐body split at rest, the fragments recoil with equal and opposite momenta p. Their kinetic energies are T1 = p²/(2M1) and T2 = p²/(2M2). The sum T1+T2 = ΔE gives p² = 2ΔE/(1/M1 + 1/M2). Substituting back, T1 = ΔE·(1/M1)/(1/M1 + 1/M2) = ΔE·[1/(1 + M1/M2)]. Here M1 = mass of the more massive fragment = 2m, M2 = m.

This is accurate to leading order in (v/c)² given v/c ≲0.2. Its limitations are that it ignores higher-order relativistic terms (O((v/c)⁴)), any internal excitation or deformation energy of fragments, recoil beyond the simple two-body picture, and possible photon or neutrino emission in the fission process.
