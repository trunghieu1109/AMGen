        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The task asks to extract and define the physical quantities given in the problem statement without solving the kinematics. The key data are: the rest-mass energy of the original nucleus, the mass ratio of the two fission fragments, and the fact that the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the original mass. We identify each symbol and its meaning: M for the initial rest mass, E\u2080=300\u2009GeV for its rest-mass energy, M\u2081 and M\u2082 for the fragment rest masses with M\u2081\u2236M\u2082=2\u22361, and M\u2081+M\u2082=0.99\u2009M.; answer - Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: E\u2080=300\u2009GeV (so M c\u00b2=300\u2009GeV). Mass ratio of fragments: M\u2081\u2009:\u2009M\u2082=2\u2009:\u20091 (heavier fragment has twice the rest mass of the lighter). Sum of fragments\u2019 rest masses: M\u2081+M\u2082=0.99\u2009M (i.e. the two fragments together carry 99% of the original nucleus\u2019s rest mass).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have M1\u2009:\u2009M2\u2009=\u20092\u2009:\u20091 and M1+M2\u2009=\u20090.99\u2009M. Let M2\u2009=\u2009x, then M1\u2009=\u20092x. So 2x+x=3x=0.99\u2009M \u21d2 x=0.33\u2009M. Hence M2=0.33\u2009M and M1=2\u00d70.33\u2009M=0.66\u2009M.; answer - M1 = 0.66\u2009M, M2 = 0.33\u2009M\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The initial nucleus has rest energy M c^2 = 300\u2009GeV. From sub-task 2, the two fragments\u2019 rest masses sum to 0.99\u2009M, so the mass defect is \u0394M = M \u2013 0.99\u2009M = 0.01\u2009M. The energy released as kinetic energy is \u0394E = \u0394M c^2 = 0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009(300\u2009GeV) = 3\u2009GeV.; answer - 3 GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have initial rest\u2010mass energy M\u2009c\u00b2=300\u2009GeV, and the two fragments\u2019 rest masses sum to 0.99\u2009M, so \u0394E=0.01\u00d7300\u2009GeV=3\u2009GeV is released as kinetic energy. Let the fragment masses be m1 and m2 with m1=2\u2009m2 and m1+m2=0.99\u2009M=297\u2009GeV, so m2=99\u2009GeV, m1=198\u2009GeV. By momentum conservation p1=\u2212p2=p and by energy conservation E1+E2=300\u2009GeV with E1=\u221a(p\u00b2+m1\u00b2), E2=\u221a(p\u00b2+m2\u00b2). Thus \u221a(p\u00b2+198\u00b2)+\u221a(p\u00b2+99\u00b2)=300. Solving: \u221a(p\u00b2+99\u00b2)=B\u2248100.995\u2009GeV, \u221a(p\u00b2+198\u00b2)=A\u2248199.005\u2009GeV, giving p\u00b2\u2248399\u2009(GeV)\u00b2. Then E1\u2248199.005\u2009GeV and the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is T1=E1\u2212m1\u2248199.005\u2212198=1.005\u2009GeV.; answer - T1 \u2248 1.005 GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We have total kinetic energy available \u0394E = 3 GeV from sub-task 3. In a classical two\u2010body split at rest, the fragments recoil with equal and opposite momenta p. Their kinetic energies are T1 = p\u00b2/(2M1) and T2 = p\u00b2/(2M2). The sum T1+T2 = \u0394E gives p\u00b2 = 2\u0394E/(1/M1 + 1/M2). Substituting back, T1 = \u0394E\u00b7(1/M1)/(1/M1 + 1/M2) = \u0394E\u00b7[1/(1 + M1/M2)]. Here M1 = mass of the more massive fragment = 2m, M2 = m. Thus M1/M2 = 2, so T1 = \u0394E\u00b71/(1+2) = \u0394E/3 = 3 GeV/3 = 1 GeV. Therefore, classically T1_classical \u2248 1 GeV.; answer - T1_classical = 1 GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From sub-task 4, the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is T1 \u22431.005 GeV. From sub-task 5, the classical approximation gives T1_classical \u22431.000 GeV. Their difference is \u0394T = T1 \u2212 T1_classical = 1.005 GeV \u2212 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which equals 5 MeV. This small difference arises from the first relativistic correction term O((v/c)\u00b2) neglected in the classical formula and is accurate as long as v/c\u22720.2; higher-order terms and other nuclear effects would only contribute at the keV level.; answer - 5 MeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From sub-task 6 we determined that the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is \u0394T \u2243 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Among the provided options\u201410 MeV (A), 5 MeV (B), 2 MeV (C), and 20 MeV (D)\u2014the value 5 MeV is an exact match. Therefore, the correct multiple\u2010choice letter is B.; answer - B)"
