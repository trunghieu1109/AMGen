Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_173
proposed answer: From sub-task 6 we determined that the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is ΔT ≃ 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Among the provided options—10 MeV (A), 5 MeV (B), 2 MeV (C), and 20 MeV (D)—the value 5 MeV is an exact match. Therefore, the correct multiple‐choice letter is B.
