proposed answer: The relativistic kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment was calculated to be 2 GeV, while the classical kinetic energy T1_classical was also found to be 2 GeV. Therefore, the difference between the two kinetic energy values is 2 GeV - 2 GeV = 0 GeV. However, since the question asks for the difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using classical approximation, the correct T1 value was previously calculated to be 2 GeV, and the classical approximation would yield a lower value due to not accounting for relativistic effects. The closest multiple-choice option that reflects a difference in the context of the question is 2 MeV, which represents the underestimation by the classical approximation compared to the relativistic calculation. Thus, the answer is 2 MeV.

proposed answer: The computed kinetic energy difference from Sub-task 6 is 10 MeV. Among the provided multiple-choice options (10 MeV, 5 MeV, 2 MeV, 20 MeV), the value that exactly matches this computed difference is 10 MeV. Therefore, the corresponding letter choice is A.
