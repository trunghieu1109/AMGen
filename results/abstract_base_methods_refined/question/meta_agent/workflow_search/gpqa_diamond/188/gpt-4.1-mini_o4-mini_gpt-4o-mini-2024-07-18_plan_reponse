        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The user wants a definition and implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics, specifically its impact on quasiparticles and modes. I will define the concept clearly, mention the Nambu\u2013Goldstone theorem, explain degeneracy of vacua, give examples (magnons, phonons, pions) and connect broken continuous symmetries to gapless modes.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics occurs when the underlying laws (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) possess a continuous symmetry that the system\u2019s ground state (vacuum) does not share. Although the equations of motion remain invariant under a symmetry group G, the chosen vacuum breaks G down to a smaller subgroup H, yielding multiple degenerate ground states. According to the Nambu\u2013Goldstone theorem, each broken continuous generator produces a gapless collective excitation (Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode). In condensed matter these excitations appear as quasiparticles: for example, breaking spin-rotational symmetry yields magnons, breaking translational symmetry yields phonons, and in particle physics breaking chiral symmetry yields pions. These effective particles thus directly reflect the broken symmetry and govern the low-energy dynamics of the system.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to characterize each of the four objects in terms of (1) their physical nature and (2) whether they arise as Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry (and thus are associated with such breaking). Magnons, phonons, and pions are textbook examples of NG bosons tied to broken spin\u2010rotational, translational, and chiral symmetries, respectively. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons or textures, not gapless NG excitations of a broken continuous symmetry.; answer - Magnon: A quasiparticle describing collective spin\u2010wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system. It is the Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode arising from spontaneously broken spin-rotational symmetry\u2014yes, associated.\n\nSkyrmion: A topologically stable spin texture or soliton in a magnetic medium (or more generally in field theories). It is not a gapless mode of a broken continuous symmetry but rather a nonperturbative, topological excitation\u2014no, not associated.\n\nPion: A pseudoscalar meson in QCD, interpreted as the (approximate) Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry\u2014yes, associated.\n\nPhonon: A quasiparticle corresponding to lattice vibration modes in a crystal. It is the Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode due to spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry\u2014yes, associated.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - According to the Nambu\u2013Goldstone theorem, each broken continuous symmetry produces a gapless mode. In a magnetically ordered material the spin-rotational symmetry is broken, yielding magnons. In a crystal the continuous translational symmetry is broken to a discrete lattice symmetry, yielding phonons. In QCD the approximate chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, giving rise to (nearly) massless pions. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topologically nontrivial soliton configurations and not perturbative, gapless excitations tied to a broken continuous symmetry. Thus only magnons, phonons, and pions qualify as Goldstone modes, while skyrmions do not.; answer - Magnon: associated (Goldstone mode of broken spin-rotational symmetry); Pion: associated (approximate Goldstone boson of broken chiral symmetry); Phonon: associated (Goldstone mode of broken translational symmetry); Skyrmion: not associated (topological soliton, not a Goldstone mode)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3 we see that magnons, pions, and phonons all arise as Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries: magnons from broken spin-rotation, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken translational symmetry. By contrast, a skyrmion is a topological soliton configuration rather than a gapless excitation tied to a symmetry breaking. Therefore the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the skyrmion.; answer - Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Among the listed options, magnons, pions, and phonons all arise as Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. The skyrmion, however, is a topological soliton and is not associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. In the choices A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon, the skyrmion corresponds to letter B.; answer - B"
