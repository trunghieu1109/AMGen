        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics refers to a situation where the underlying laws possess a certain symmetry, but the state of the system does not exhibit that symmetry. This often occurs in systems at low temperatures or energies, where the ground state of the system does not reflect the symmetry of the governing equations. In such cases, effective particles or quasiparticles can emerge as excitations around the ground state. These quasiparticles are associated with the broken symmetry and often correspond to collective modes of the system. For example, in a ferromagnet, the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, and magnons (spin waves) are the associated quasiparticles. In the case of a crystal lattice, translational symmetry is broken, and phonons (lattice vibrations) are the quasiparticles. Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the other examples. Therefore, understanding spontaneously-broken symmetry helps identify which quasiparticles are associated with such phenomena.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics refers to a situation where the underlying laws possess a certain symmetry, but the state of the system does not exhibit that symmetry.

Therefore, understanding spontaneously-broken symmetry helps identify which quasiparticles are associated with such phenomena.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To answer this question, I need to describe each of the particles mentioned (Magnon, Skyrmion, Pion, Phonon) and explain their physical nature and association with symmetry breaking or topological properties. Based on the definition of spontaneously-broken symmetry from Sub-task 1, I know that magnons are associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, phonons with the breaking of translational symmetry in crystal lattices, and pions with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Skyrmions are topological solitons and are not directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same sense. Therefore, I will describe each particle in this context.; answer - Magnon: A magnon is a quasiparticle representing a collective excitation of the electron spins in a crystal lattice, typically associated with the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets. Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton, a stable, localized field configuration that can occur in certain magnetic systems. It is not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry but rather with topological properties of the system. Pion: A pion is a meson, a type of subatomic particle, that emerges as a Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonon: A phonon is a quasiparticle representing a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, associated with the breaking of translational symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Based on the analysis from Sub-tasks 1 and 2, we know that magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons are associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, phonons with the breaking of translational symmetry in crystal lattices, and pions with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. These particles can be considered as Goldstone bosons or related excitations that arise due to the spontaneous breaking of these symmetries. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way. Therefore, the particles associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries are magnons, pions, and phonons.; answer - The particles associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries are magnons, pions, and phonons.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All four debate agents agree that magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons are linked to the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, phonons to the breaking of translational symmetry in crystal lattices, and pions to the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the other particles. Therefore, the consensus among the agents is that the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - In the original question, the choices are listed as follows: A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon. From Sub-task 4, the identified particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion. According to the original question's order, Skyrmion corresponds to choice B).
