This often occurs in systems at low temperatures or energies, where the ground state of the system does not reflect the symmetry of the governing equations. In such cases, effective particles or quasiparticles can emerge as excitations around the ground state. These quasiparticles are associated with the broken symmetry and often correspond to collective modes of the system.
