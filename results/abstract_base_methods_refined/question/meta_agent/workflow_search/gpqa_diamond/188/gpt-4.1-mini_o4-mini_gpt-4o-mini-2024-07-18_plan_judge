Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: Among the listed options, magnons, pions, and phonons all arise as Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. The skyrmion, however, is a topological soliton and is not associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. In the choices A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon, the skyrmion corresponds to letter B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
