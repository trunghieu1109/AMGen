Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_7_188
proposed answer: In the original question, the choices are listed as follows: A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon. From Sub-task 4, the identified particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion. According to the original question's order, Skyrmion corresponds to choice B). Therefore, the answer is B).
