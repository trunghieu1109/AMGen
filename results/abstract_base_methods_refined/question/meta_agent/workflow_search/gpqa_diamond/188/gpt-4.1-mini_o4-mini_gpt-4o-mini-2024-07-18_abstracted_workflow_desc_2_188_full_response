I will define the concept clearly, mention the Nambu–Goldstone theorem, explain degeneracy of vacua, give examples (magnons, phonons, pions) and connect broken continuous symmetries to gapless modes.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics occurs when the underlying laws (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) possess a continuous symmetry that the system’s ground state (vacuum) does not share. Although the equations of motion remain invariant under a symmetry group G, the chosen vacuum breaks G down to a smaller subgroup H, yielding multiple degenerate ground states.

Magnons, phonons, and pions are known Nambu–Goldstone modes arising from broken continuous symmetries, while skyrmions are topological solitons rather than gapless Goldstone excitations.; answer: Magnon: A quasiparticle representing a quantized spin wave in a magnetically ordered material. It arises from spontaneously broken continuous spin-rotational symmetry (SU(2)→U(1)), so it is a Nambu–Goldstone mode.\n\nSkyrmion: A topological soliton in certain magnetic or field-theoretic systems characterized by a nontrivial winding of the order parameter. It is not a gapless Goldstone mode of a broken continuous symmetry but rather a stable, particle-like configuration protected by topology.\n\nPion: A pseudoscalar meson in quantum chromodynamics.

It originates from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the crystal lattice (continuous→discrete), making it a Nambu–Goldstone mode.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent JHym, analyzing particle associations, thinking: To determine which excitations are Goldstone modes, we recall that Nambu–Goldstone bosons arise from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries.  \n- Magnons are collective spin‐wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system; they originate from the breaking of spin‐rotational symmetry, so they are NG modes.  \n- Phonons are lattice vibration quanta; they arise because a crystal breaks continuous translational symmetry down to a discrete subgroup, hence they are NG modes.  \n- Pions are the (approximate) pseudoscalar mesons in QCD and act as the NG bosons from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry.  \n- Skyrmions are topologically nontrivial field configurations (solitons), not gapless fluctuations of a broken symmetry, so they are not NG modes.; answer: Magnon: associated (NG mode of broken spin-rotational symmetry)\nPion: associated (NG boson of broken chiral symmetry)\nPhonon: associated (NG mode of broken continuous translational symmetry)\nSkyrmion: not associated (topological soliton, not a Goldstone mode)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent fOqX, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly matches magnons, pions, and phonons to Nambu–Goldstone modes and identifies skyrmions as non‐Goldstone excitations. However, it treats all symmetries as exact and ignores real‐world effects that modify or gap these modes.; answer: Limitations: (1) Pions are only approximate Goldstone bosons because explicit chiral symmetry breaking by quark masses gives them a finite mass. (2) Phonons in crystals can acquire small gaps or changes in dispersion due to lattice anisotropy or external stresses, so their NG character is not ideal. (3) Magnons in real magnets may be gapped by spin–orbit coupling or anisotropies, making them pseudo‐Goldstone modes. (4) Skyrmions, though not Goldstone modes, can emerge from broken symmetries in nonlinear sigma models and carry low‐energy dynamics beyond simple soliton classification. (5) The analysis omits quantum corrections and topological terms that can further modify these excitations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent JHym, refining analysis, thinking: According to the Nambu–Goldstone theorem, each broken continuous symmetry produces a gapless mode.
