Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_170
proposed answer: The final decision on the order of substances by increasing para-isomer yield is 4<6<2<1<5<3, as determined in Sub-task 5. We need to match this order with the given multiple-choice options. The options are: choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3'. Comparing these options with the order from Sub-task 5, we see that choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3' matches exactly with the order 4<6<2<1<5<3. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
