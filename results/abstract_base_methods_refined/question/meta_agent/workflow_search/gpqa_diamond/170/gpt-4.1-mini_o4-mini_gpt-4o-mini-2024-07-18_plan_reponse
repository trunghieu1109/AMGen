        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To identify substituents and their electronic effects, consider the nature of each group: whether it donates electron density into the ring (activating, ortho/para director) or withdraws electron density (deactivating, meta director). Alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) donate via hyperconjugation; carbonyl\u2010containing groups and nitro withdraw by both induction and resonance; halogens withdraw by induction but can donate by resonance.; answer - 1) \u2013CH\u2083 (methyl): an alkyl group; weakly electron-donating by hyperconjugation; activating; ortho/para director.\n2) \u2013COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl/ester): a carbonyl\u2010containing group; electron-withdrawing by \u2013I and \u2013R effects; deactivating; meta director.\n3) \u2013Cl (chloro): a halogen; electron-withdrawing by \u2013I, electron-donating by +R but net deactivating; ortho/para director.\n4) \u2013NO\u2082 (nitro): strong electron-withdrawing by \u2013I and \u2013R; strongly deactivating; meta director.\n5) \u2013C\u2082H\u2085 (ethyl): an alkyl group; electron-donating by hyperconjugation; activating; ortho/para director.\n6) \u2013COOH (carboxyl): a carbonyl\u2010containing acid; electron-withdrawing by \u2013I and \u2013R; deactivating; meta director.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We use standard principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution: activating groups donate electron density (via hyperconjugation or resonance) and accelerate reaction, directing ortho/para positions. Deactivating groups withdraw electron density (inductively or by resonance) and slow reaction, directing meta (unless they have resonance donation overriding induction, like halogens which are deactivating overall but ortho/para directing). Thus:\n1) \u2013CH\u2083 is an alkyl; donates by hyperconjugation (activating), ortho/para director.\n2) \u2013COOEt is a carbonyl-containing ester; withdraws by \u2013I and \u2013R (deactivating), meta director.\n3) \u2013Cl is a halogen; withdraws by \u2013I but donates weakly by +R, net deactivating yet ortho/para director.\n4) \u2013NO\u2082 is strongly electron-withdrawing by \u2013I and \u2013R (strongly deactivating), meta director.\n5) \u2013C\u2082H\u2085 is an alkyl; donates by hyperconjugation (activating), ortho/para director.\n6) \u2013COOH is a carboxyl; withdraws by \u2013I and \u2013R (deactivating), meta director.; answer - 1) \u2013CH\u2083: activating, ortho/para-directing\n2) \u2013COOEt: deactivating, meta-directing\n3) \u2013Cl: deactivating, ortho/para-directing\n4) \u2013NO\u2082: deactivating, meta-directing\n5) \u2013C\u2082H\u2085: activating, ortho/para-directing\n6) \u2013COOH: deactivating, meta-directing\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Substituents that donate electron density into the ring (activating, ortho/para directors) raise the \u03c0\u2010electron density and accelerate electrophilic attack at both ortho and para positions. Among alkyls, \u2013C2H5 is slightly more electron\u2010releasing by hyperconjugation than \u2013CH3 and is bulkier, so steric hindrance disfavors ortho attack to a greater extent, further enriching the para product. In contrast, deactivating, ortho/para director \u2013Cl withdraws by induction (\u2013I) and slows the overall rate, so although resonance (+R) directs to ortho/para, the para yield is lower than for alkyls. Strong deactivators that are meta directors (\u2013COOEt, \u2013COOH, \u2013NO2) withdraw by both \u2013I and \u2013R, depleting ring electron density and making electrophilic attack at para (or any) position very unfavorable; among these, \u2013NO2 is the most deactivating and gives essentially no para product, followed by \u2013COOH and then \u2013COOEt which is slightly less withdrawing. Thus the para\u2010isomer yield increases in the order: NO2 \u226a COOH < COOEt < Cl < CH3 < C2H5.; answer - Overall ranking of para-isomer yields in bromination: NO2 < COOH < COOEt < Cl < CH3 < C2H5. Activating, ortho/para-directors give high para yields (C2H5 > CH3); deactivating, ortho/para-director Cl gives moderate para yield; deactivating, meta-directors give low to negligible para yields (COOEt > COOH > NO2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We need to assign approximate weight\u2010fraction yields for the para\u2010brominated products of each benzene derivative, consistent with their activating/deactivating and directing effects. Strong meta director \u2013NO2 virtually suppresses para substitution (~2%). \u2013COOH is a strong deactivator but still directs meta with slight ortho/para contributions \u2013 we estimate ~8%. \u2013COOEt is slightly less deactivating than \u2013COOH and also meta director \u2013 estimate ~15%. \u2013Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director; resonance donation increases para though induction slows reaction \u2013 estimate ~25%. \u2013CH3 is a moderate activating ortho/para director \u2013 the para yield is higher, steric hindrance limits ortho to some extent \u2013 estimate ~45%. \u2013C2H5 is slightly more activating by hyperconjugation than CH3 and bulkier, further disfavouring ortho \u2013 estimate ~60%. Ordering and numerical values thus reflect the increasing \u03c0\u2010density and steric patterns.; answer - Estimated weight\u2010fraction yields of para\u2010bromo isomer:\n1) C6H5\u2013CH3: ~45%\n2) C6H5\u2013COOC2H5: ~15%\n3) C6H5\u2013Cl: ~25%\n4) C6H5\u2013NO2: ~2%\n5) C6H5\u2013C2H5: ~60%\n6) C6H5\u2013COOH: ~8%\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Based on the estimated para\u2010bromo yields from Sub\u2010task 4 for each substituted benzene: 4) \u2013NO\u2082 ~2% (strong meta\u2010director, almost no para), 6) \u2013COOH ~8% (strongly deactivating, slight ortho/para), 2) \u2013COOEt ~15% (moderately deactivating, meta director), 3) \u2013Cl ~25% (deactivating but ortho/para director), 1) \u2013CH\u2083 ~45% (activating ortho/para director), 5) \u2013C\u2082H\u2085 ~60% (activating and sterically bulky, favoring para). Sorting these from lowest to highest para\u2010isomer yield gives: 4<6<2<3<1<5.; answer - 4<6<2<3<1<5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From Sub-task 5 we determined the increasing order of para-isomer yields as 4<6<2<3<1<5. Comparing this sequence with the given options: A is 3<5<1<6<2<4 (completely different), B is 4<2<6<3<1<5 (2 and 6 swapped), C is 6<2<4<5<1<3 (starts with 6<2<4, wrong), and D is 4<6<2<1<5<3.
