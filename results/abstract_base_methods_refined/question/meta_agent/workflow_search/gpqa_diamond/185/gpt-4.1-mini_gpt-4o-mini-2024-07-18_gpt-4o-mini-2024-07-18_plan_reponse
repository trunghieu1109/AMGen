In the case of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the rearrangement will involve the breaking of the sigma bonds between the atoms involved in the diene and the formation of new sigma bonds as the substituents rearrange. The mechanism can be shown with curved arrows indicating the movement of electrons: the pi bonds in the diene system will rearrange to form new bonds, leading to the formation of a new product. Stereochemically, the Cope rearrangement can exhibit endo/exo preferences, which are influenced by the bicyclic structure of the starting material. The endo transition state is generally favored due to steric and electronic interactions, which can affect the final stereochemistry of the product. This stereochemical aspect is crucial because it can lead to different stereoisomers depending on the pathway taken during the rearrangement. Therefore, understanding the stereochemistry of the starting material helps predict the stereochemical outcome of the product formed after the Cope rearrangement.; answer - The Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement where the sigma bonds break and new sigma bonds form as substituents migrate.
