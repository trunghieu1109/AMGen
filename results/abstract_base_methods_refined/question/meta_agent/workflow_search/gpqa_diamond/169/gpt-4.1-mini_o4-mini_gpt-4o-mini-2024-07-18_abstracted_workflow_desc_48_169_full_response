The spin operator S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y with σ_y = [[0,−i],[i,0]]. First compute σ_y ψ: \nσ_yψ = [0*(3i/5) + (−i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5)] = [−4i/5, (3i^2)/5] = [−4i/5, −3/5].\nThen S_yψ = (ħ/2)*σ_yψ = [−4i ħ/10, −3 ħ/10] = [−2i ħ/5, −3 ħ/10].\nNext compute ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = ψ†·(S_yψ).

Its norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, so the normalized state is ψ = (3i/5,\u20094/5). The spin operator S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, with σ_y = [[0,\u2009−i],[i,\u20090]].\n\nWe compute S_y|ψ⟩:\nσ_y|ψ⟩ = [0·(3i/5) + (−i)·(4/5),\u2009i·(3i/5) + 0·(4/5)]ᵀ = [−4i/5,\u20093i²/5]ᵀ = [−4i/5,\u2009−3/5]ᵀ.  \nThus S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2)[−4i/5,\u2009−3/5]ᵀ.\n\nNext, ⟨ψ| = (−3i/5,\u20094/5).
