Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_48_190
proposed answer: Product 4, after Wolffâ€“Kishner reduction and hydrogenolysis steps, is a fully saturated cyclohexane bearing only an isopropyl substituent and a free hydroxymethyl group. Choices B and C retain tosyl or benzyl protecting groups, and D introduces an extra butyl chain. Only choice A, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, matches the deduced structure.
