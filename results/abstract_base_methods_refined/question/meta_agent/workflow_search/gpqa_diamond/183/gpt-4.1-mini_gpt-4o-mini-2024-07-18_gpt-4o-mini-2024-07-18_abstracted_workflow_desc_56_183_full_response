The ethoxy group is also an electron-donating group, but it is less sterically hindered than tert-butyl and will also direct substitutions to the ortho and para positions. The nitro group, on the other hand, is a strong electron-withdrawing group and will direct substitutions to the meta position. Therefore, to achieve the desired substitutions efficiently, the tert-butyl group should be introduced first to position 2, followed by the ethoxy group at position 1, and finally the nitro group at position 3. This order ensures that the electron-donating effects of tert-butyl and ethoxy facilitate the introduction of the nitro group, which would otherwise be more challenging due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

This will facilitate the subsequent electrophilic substitutions. The ethoxy group is also an electron-donating group and is ortho/para-directing, so it can be introduced next. The nitro group, being a strong electron-withdrawing group, is meta-directing and should be introduced last to avoid deactivating the ring for further substitutions.
