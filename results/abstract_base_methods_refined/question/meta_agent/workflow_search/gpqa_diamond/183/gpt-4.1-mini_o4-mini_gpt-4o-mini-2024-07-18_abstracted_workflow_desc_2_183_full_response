Numbering with the ethoxy group at C1, we see three substituents: an ethoxy (–OCH2CH3) at C1, a tert-butyl (–C(CH3)3) at C2 (ortho to the ethoxy), and a nitro (–NO2) at C3 (meta to the ethoxy). The functional groups are: an ether linkage (C–O–C), a nitro group, and an alkyl substituent. To build this from benzene, we must introduce: (1) a tert-butyl group via a Friedel–Crafts alkylation, (2) an ethoxy group via a Williamson ether synthesis (or alkylation of a phenoxide), and (3) a nitro group via electrophilic aromatic nitration. The directing effects are key: the tert-butyl is o/p‐directing, the ethoxy is strongly o/p‐directing, and the nitro is meta‐directing. Thus when planning the sequence, we must install the groups in an order that gives the correct substitution pattern.; answer - Functional groups: ether (ethoxy), nitro, and alkyl (tert-butyl). Positions on benzene (with ethoxy at C1): C1 – ethoxy; C2 – tert-butyl (ortho to ethoxy); C3 – nitro (meta to ethoxy).

We know:\n• Nitro (–NO2) is a strong deactivator and directs new EAS to the meta position.\n• tert-Butyl (–C(CH3)3) is an activating o/p-director.\n• Ethoxy (–OEt) is an activating o/p-director but is introduced by nucleophilic substitution (Williamson ether), not EAS.\n\nTo get the nitro meta to the future ethoxy, we must introduce NO2 first on benzene. That places it at C1 of the interim nitrobenzene. Next, doing Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation on nitrobenzene (with NO2 meta-directing) installs tBu at the meta position relative to NO2 — i.e. at the position that will become C2 relative to the final ethoxy. Finally, the ethoxy group is installed via Williamson ether synthesis on the remaining activated site. This sequence places the substituents at the correct 1-OEt, 2-tBu, 3-NO2 arrangement.; answer - First introduce the nitro group (NO2) on benzene (meta-director), then install the tert-butyl via Friedel–Crafts (o/p director) onto nitrobenzene, and lastly install the ethoxy by Williamson ether synthesis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The initial three‐step sequence (nitration → Friedel–Crafts t-butylation on nitrobenzene → Williamson ether) fails because (a) nitrobenzene is too deactivated for efficient t-butylation under AlCl₃, and (b) there is no phenolic –OH for Williamson etherification. To introduce an ethoxy group by Williamson chemistry, we must first convert a suitable –NH₂ or –OH precursor into phenol. A workable order is: (1) nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene; (2) reduce/diazotize/hydrolyze nitrobenzene to phenol; (3) perform Williamson etherification to give ethoxybenzene (phenetole); (4) Friedel–Crafts tert‐butylation on phenetole at ortho to OEt; (5) final nitration to install the nitro between t-butyl and ethoxy. Steps (2) and (3) generate the phenetole needed for step (4), and step (5) places NO₂ in the only free ortho position between OEt and t-Bu.; answer - 1) Nitration: treat benzene with conc.

We know:\n• Nitro (–NO2) is a strong deactivator and directs new EAS to the meta position.\n• tert-Butyl (–C(CH3)3) is an activating o/p-director.\n• Ethoxy (–OEt) is an activating o/p-director but is introduced by nucleophilic substitution (Williamson ether), not EAS.\n\nTo get the nitro meta to the future ethoxy, we must introduce NO2 first on benzene.

Next, doing Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation on nitrobenzene (with NO2 meta-directing) installs tBu at the meta position relative to NO2 — i.e. at the position that will become C2 relative to the final ethoxy. Finally, the ethoxy group is installed via Williamson ether synthesis on the remaining activated site. This sequence places the substituents at the correct 1-OEt, 2-tBu, 3-NO2 arrangement.; answer: First introduce the nitro group (NO2) on benzene (meta-director), then install the tert-butyl via Friedel–Crafts (o/p director) onto nitrobenzene, and lastly install the ethoxy by Williamson ether synthesis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 0URR, determining directing effects and substitution order, thinking: The ethoxy (–OEt) and tert-butyl (–tBu) substituents are both strongly activating, ortho/para directors. The nitro group (–NO2) is deactivating and a meta director. To place NO2 in the position meta to the ethoxy (i.e. between the ethoxy at C1 and t-Bu at C2), nitration must be performed last on a benzene ring already bearing both activating groups. Those two groups will block their ortho/para sites, leaving the desired position (C3) as the most activated position for the incoming nitronium ion. Putting nitration first would place NO2 in the wrong position, and trying to install one activating group in the presence of NO2 would be difficult (ring deactivated). Therefore the correct sequence of EAS steps is: first introduce t-Bu and ethoxy (the two ortho/para directors), then perform the nitration as the final electrophilic aromatic substitution.; answer: Install tert-butyl and ethoxy first (both ortho/para directors), then perform nitration last to place NO2 meta to the ethoxy.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent d43u, determining directing effects and substitution order, thinking: We need to place three substituents so that in the final molecule (with ethoxy at C1) the tert-butyl is at C2 (ortho to ethoxy) and the nitro is at C3 (meta to ethoxy). Ethoxy (–OEt) and tert-butyl (–t-Bu) are both ortho/para directors; nitro (–NO₂) is a meta director. If we install ethoxy before nitration, it would direct NO₂ into its ortho/para positions, giving the wrong pattern. Therefore, nitration must occur before ethoxy is on the ring. To ensure the nitro ends up meta to the future ethoxy, we first carry out a Friedel–Crafts alkylation (tert-butylation) on benzene, which directs the subsequent nitration into positions ortho/para to t-Bu; by choosing the correct reaction conditions we can install NO₂ at the site that will become C3 after ethoxylation. Finally, we introduce the ethoxy via a Williamson ether synthesis at the ring position adjacent to t-Bu. This sequence—t-Bu first, NO₂ second, OEt last—ensures the correct relative positions.; answer: tert-Butyl and ethoxy are ortho/para directors; nitro is a meta director. Thus the correct EAS order is: (1) Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation, (2) nitration (with only t-Bu present), and (3) ethoxy installation (Williamson ether synthesis).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent YKkg, identifying reagents and conditions, thinking: Based on the directing effects established in Sub-task 2, we must introduce the meta-director (NO₂) first, then the o/p-director (t-Bu), and finally install the ethoxy via a Williamson ether. Each step uses well-known aromatic or nucleophilic substitution conditions:\n\n1) Nitration: conc. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ at low temperature ensures mono-nitration to nitrobenzene without over-substitution.  \n2) Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation: t-BuCl with AlCl₃ at 0–25 °C introduces the tert-butyl at the position meta to NO₂ (which becomes C2 relative to the future ethoxy).  \n3) Ethoxylation (Williamson ether): deprotonate the phenolic OH (installed via prior diazotization/hydrolysis if starting from an OH; in this sub-task we assume phenol is available) with NaOH, then alkylate with EtBr under reflux to yield the ethoxy group at C1.; answer: Step 1 (nitration): treat benzene with a mixture of concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ at ca. 0 – 5 °C to give nitrobenzene.  \nStep 2 (tert-butylation): expose nitrobenzene to tert-butyl chloride and AlCl₃ (0 – 25 °C) to yield 3-nitro-2-tert-butylbenzene.  \nStep 3 (ethoxylation via Williamson ether): deprotonate the aromatic OH with NaOH, then add ethyl bromide (EtBr) under reflux to furnish the 1-ethoxy substituent.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent fMJp, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed three‐step plan (nitration → Friedel–Crafts tert‐butylation → Williamson ether) overlooks two critical issues: (1) Nitrobenzene is too deactivated for efficient tert‐butylation under standard AlCl₃ conditions, giving poor yield and overreaction byproducts. (2) There is no phenolic OH for the Williamson ether – you must first convert the nitro group to an aniline, diazotize and hydrolyze to phenol before ethoxylation. Without those steps, the ethoxy installation is impossible and overall yields will be very low.; answer: A more viable route is: (i) Friedel–Crafts tert‐butylation on benzene (t-BuCl/AlCl₃) → tert-butylbenzene; (ii) nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → 4-tert-butyl-nitrobenzene; (iii) reduction (Fe/HCl) to 4-tert-butyl-aniline; (iv) diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and hydrolysis (heat) to 4-tert-butylphenol; (v) Williamson ether formation (NaOH, EtBr) to give 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent YKkg, refining reagents and conditions, thinking: The initial three‐step sequence (nitration → Friedel–Crafts t-butylation on nitrobenzene → Williamson ether) fails because (a) nitrobenzene is too deactivated for efficient t-butylation under AlCl₃, and (b) there is no phenolic –OH for Williamson etherification.

In detail:\n\n1) tert-Butyl chloride/AlCl₃ installs the t-Bu group (o,p-director) on benzene.\n2) SO₃/H₂SO₄ sulfonates para to t-Bu, blocking that position.\n3) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ nitrates ortho to t-Bu (the only unblocked position) to give an Ar–NO₂.\n4) Fe/HCl reduces that NO₂ to NH₂.\n5) NaNO₂/HCl diazotizes the NH₂ to Ar–N₂⁺.\n6) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (second nitration) reintroduces a nitro at the same ortho position, now on the diazonium precursor, preserving regiocontrol.\n7) H₃O⁺, H₂O/heat hydrolyzes the diazonium to phenol (Ar–OH).\n8) Dilute H₂SO₄ removes the SO₃H blocking group.\n9) NaOH/EtBr performs a Williamson etherification to convert Ar–OH into the ethoxy.\n\nEach step respects the directing effects and uses blocking/unblocking strategically to give high-yield 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
