Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The mean free path λ in a gas is given by λ=1/(n·σ), where n is the number density of scatterers and σ is the effective collision cross section. In the ultra‐high vacuum state (<10^−9 Torr), λ1 is determined solely by gas–gas collisions, which have a very small σ_g, yielding a large λ1. When the 1000 kV electron beam is introduced, electrons scatter off gas molecules with a much larger cross section σ_e≫σ_g. Since the gas density n remains unchanged, the effective σ increases dramatically and thus λ2=1/(n·σ_e) becomes strictly shorter than λ1. Therefore, λ2<λ1.
