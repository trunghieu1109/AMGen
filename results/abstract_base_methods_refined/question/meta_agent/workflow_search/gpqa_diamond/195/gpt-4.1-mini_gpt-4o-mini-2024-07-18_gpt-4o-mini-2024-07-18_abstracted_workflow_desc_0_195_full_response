For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy stored in the spring is given by U = (1/2)kx^2, where x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is U_max = (1/2)kA^2. Therefore, the total energy at maximum amplitude, considering the potential energy, is E_total = U_max + K.

The total mechanical energy E of a harmonic oscillator is given by E = (1/2)kA^2, where k is the spring constant and A is the maximum amplitude. At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, so we have (1/2)mv_max^2 = (1/2)kA^2. Solving for v_max gives v_max = A√(k/m).

The total mechanical energy (E) in a harmonic oscillator is given by the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is at its maximum and kinetic energy is zero. As the mass moves towards the equilibrium position, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The maximum speed (v_max) occurs when all potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA^2, and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max^2. Setting these equal gives (1/2)kA^2 = (1/2)mv_max^2, leading to v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A.
