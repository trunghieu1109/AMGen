First, Hooke’s law gives the restoring force and hence the potential energy function. In classical mechanics that leads to simple harmonic motion, but here velocities can approach c so Newton’s second law F=ma must be replaced by its relativistic form: dp/dt=F with p=γmv, where γ=1/√(1−v²/c²). Energy conservation then involves the sum of relativistic kinetic energy (T=(γ−1)mc²) and potential energy (U=½kx²).

In the relativistic regime the kinetic energy is T=(γ−1)mc² with γ=1/√(1−v²/c²). Thus the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic and potential energies plus the rest energy: E = γmc² + U(x). At an arbitrary displacement x this becomes E(x)=γmc² + ½kx². Since energy is conserved, E(x)=constant=E(A) at the turning point x=A where v=0 (γ=1), so E = mc² + ½kA².

By Hooke’s law the potential energy is U(x)=½\u2009k\u2009x², which at the turning points x=±A is U_max=½\u2009k\u2009A². Relativistic dynamics dictates that the total energy includes the rest‐mass energy and kinetic energy, and by energy conservation one may write E=γ\u2009m\u2009c²+U(x). Since U and γ vary with x and v, this sum is constant. Evaluated at the turning point (v=0, γ=1, U=½\u2009k\u2009A²) it gives E_total=m\u2009c²+½\u2009k\u2009A².

Classical Hooke’s law (½kx² potential) is used without accounting for how a real spring’s force law transforms under Lorentz boosts or for finite propagation speed of stresses along the spring. 2. The spring is treated as massless and rigid, so retardation effects (i.e., the time it takes signals to traverse the spring) and internal relativistic dynamics are ignored. 3. Radiation reaction (if the mass is charged) and any damping are neglected. 4. It assumes that the entire potential energy can be simply added to the relativistic energy; in a fully covariant treatment one would need to include how the field energy of the spring contributes to the total 4‐momentum. 5. The formula is formally valid for any A, but physically one must ensure kA²/2mc² is not so large that the classical spring picture breaks down (i.e. the “spring” would require energies comparable to or exceeding mc² to deform).; answer: The compact result is\n\n    v(x)=c√{1−1/[1+ k(A²−x²)/(2mc²)]²}\n\nbut it must be applied with caution: it holds only if the spring can be modeled by a simple ½kx² potential in the lab frame, neglects relativistic force‐propagation and internal dynamics of the spring, and assumes no radiation or damping.

However, it implicitly assumes that Hooke’s law remains valid at arbitrarily high speeds and that no energy losses (e.g. radiation or damping) occur. It also requires that the total potential energy kA²/2 does not exceed the rest‐energy mc² of the mass; otherwise the denominator 1+kA²/(2m c²) can approach zero, making the expression singular and unphysical.; answer: v_max = c √[1 − 1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c²))²], valid only when kA²/(2m c²)<1 (so that the potential energy is less than the rest‐energy) and in the absence of nonconservative effects.
