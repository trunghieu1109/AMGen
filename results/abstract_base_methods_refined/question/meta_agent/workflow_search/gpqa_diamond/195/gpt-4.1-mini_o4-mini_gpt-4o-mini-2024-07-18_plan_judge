Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We derived from relativistic energy conservation that the maximum speed satisfies v_max = c√[1 − 1/(1 + kA²/(2m c²))²]. Scanning the provided options, only choice B exactly matches this form. The other choices either have the wrong sign inside the square root, nonrelativistic denominators, or reduce to the nonrelativistic result √(kA²/m). Therefore the correct choice is B.
