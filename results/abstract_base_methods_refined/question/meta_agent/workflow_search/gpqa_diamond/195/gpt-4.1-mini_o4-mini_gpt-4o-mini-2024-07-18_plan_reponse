        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to explain how to identify the core physical ingredients in a relativistic one\u2010dimensional harmonic oscillator. First, Hooke\u2019s law gives the restoring force and hence the potential energy function. In classical mechanics that leads to simple harmonic motion, but here velocities can approach c so Newton\u2019s second law F=ma must be replaced by its relativistic form: dp/dt=F with p=\u03b3mv, where \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2212v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Energy conservation then involves the sum of relativistic kinetic energy (T=(\u03b3\u22121)mc\u00b2) and potential energy (U=\u00bdkx\u00b2). The maximum speed occurs when all potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy. We must also note that at low speeds \u03b3\u21921 recovers the classical result v_max=\u221a(k/m)A, while at high energies v< c. These considerations guide the derivation of the correct expression for v_max.; answer - The relevant physical principles are:\n1) Hooke\u2019s law F=\u2212kx and the associated potential energy U(x)=\u00bdkx\u00b2.\n2) Relativistic dynamics: momentum p=\u03b3mv and equation of motion dp/dt=F.\n3) Relativistic energy conservation: total energy E=\u03b3mc\u00b2+U(x).\n4) The speed limit v<c (\u03b3\u2192\u221e as v\u2192c).\n5) Consistency with the classical limit (v\u226ac gives simple harmonic motion).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To write down the energies, we start with Hooke\u2019s law F=\u2212kx, which gives the potential by integrating: U(x)=\u222b0^x kx\u2032 dx\u2032=\u00bdkx\u00b2. In relativity, the kinetic energy is T=(\u03b3\u22121)mc\u00b2, so the total energy is E=T+U+m c\u00b2\u2212m c\u00b2 (if you count rest energy directly) or more compactly E=\u03b3mc\u00b2+U(x). Since energy is conserved, this constant equals its value at maximum amplitude x=A, where v=0 (\u03b3=1), giving E=m c\u00b2+\u00bdkA\u00b2. This matches the classical limit when c\u2192\u221e.; answer - The potential energy is U(x)=\u00bdkx\u00b2. The total energy is E=\u03b3mc\u00b2+\u00bdkx\u00b2, with \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2212v\u00b2/c\u00b2), which remains constant and equals E=m c\u00b2+\u00bdkA\u00b2 at x=A (v=0).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Starting from energy conservation for a relativistic particle in a Hookean potential: the total energy E is constant and given by E=\u03b3mc\u00b2+\u00bdkx\u00b2, where \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2212v\u00b2/c\u00b2). At the turning point x=A, v=0 so E=mc\u00b2+\u00bdkA\u00b2. Subtracting rest and potential energy at a general x gives the kinetic energy (\u03b3\u22121)mc\u00b2=E\u2212mc\u00b2\u2212\u00bdkx\u00b2=\u00bdk(A\u00b2\u2212x\u00b2). Solving for \u03b3 yields \u03b3=1+ k(A\u00b2\u2212x\u00b2)/(2mc\u00b2). Finally, using \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2212v\u00b2/c\u00b2) and solving for v gives the stated v(x). The caveats are that this uses a classical spring potential, ignores spring dynamics under Lorentz boosts, assumes a massless rigid spring, neglects field energy of the spring, and is valid only when kA\u00b2/2mc\u00b2\u226a1 so the spring model remains physical.; answer - v(x)=c\u221a{1\u22121/[1+ k(A\u00b2\u2212x\u00b2)/(2mc\u00b2)]\u00b2}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Starting from the general relativistic velocity profile v(x)=c\u221a[1\u22121/[1+ k(A\u00b2\u2212x\u00b2)/(2mc\u00b2)]\u00b2], the kinetic energy\u2014and hence speed\u2014is maximized when the potential energy is minimized. This occurs at the equilibrium position x=0, where A\u00b2\u2212x\u00b2=A\u00b2. Substituting x=0 into v(x) gives\n\nv_max = c \u221a[1 \u2212 1/(1 + kA\u00b2/(2m c\u00b2))\u00b2].\n\nThis expression assumes a rigid, massless spring obeying Hooke\u2019s law at all speeds and neglects radiative or damping losses. It also requires kA\u00b2/2 < mc\u00b2 to keep the denominator nonzero and the result physical.; answer - v_max = c \u221a[1 \u2212 1/(1 + kA\u00b2/(2m c\u00b2))\u00b2]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We derived from relativistic energy conservation that the maximum speed satisfies v_max = c\u221a[1 \u2212 1/(1 + kA\u00b2/(2m c\u00b2))\u00b2].
