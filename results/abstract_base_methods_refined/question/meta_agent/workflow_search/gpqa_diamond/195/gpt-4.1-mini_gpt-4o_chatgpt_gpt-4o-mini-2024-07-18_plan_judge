Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The derived expression for the maximum velocity v_max is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options. Choice 2 is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2), which matches exactly with our derived expression. The other options do not match: Choice 1 has an incorrect structure with a '+' sign, Choice 3 lacks the relativistic factor properly, and Choice 4 is a non-relativistic expression. Therefore, the correct choice is Choice 2.
