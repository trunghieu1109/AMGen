Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: After reviewing the derived expression for the maximum speed v_max of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, it is clear that the correct formula matches choice 2, which is v_max = câˆš(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This expression accurately incorporates the relativistic effects that are significant in this scenario. The alternative choices either contain incorrect formulations or fail to account for the necessary relativistic adjustments, confirming that choice 2 is indeed the correct answer.
