proposed answer: The problem states that the spherical conductor is initially uncharged and has a cavity with a charge +q inside. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, and consequently, a charge of +q appears on the outer surface of the conductor. However, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge on the conductor. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the net charge on the conductor is zero, as the +q inside the cavity and the induced -q on the inner surface cancel each other out. Therefore, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is zero because the net charge on the conductor's surface is zero. Among the given choices, none explicitly state that the electric field is zero. However, based on the physical understanding, the correct choice should reflect the fact that the electric field at point P is zero, which is not directly listed in the choices, but the understanding is that the net effect is zero field.

Answer:The electric field at point P is zero.

proposed answer: The problem states that the charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Due to the symmetry of the problem and the properties of conductors, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center, is given by the expression for the electric field due to a point charge: E = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * (q / L^2). This matches choice D) '$E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$'.
