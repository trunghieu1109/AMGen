Placing a point charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge distribution of –q on the inner cavity surface. Because the conductor as a whole is uncharged, +q must appear on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law the net charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the conductor is +q, so the field outside is as if +q were located at the conductor’s center. Inside the metal conductor E=0, on the cavity wall the surface charge density cancels the field in the conductor, and outside E is radial and falls off as 1/L2.; answer: Inside the conducting material E=0 and the conductor is an equipotential. A charge –q is induced on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. Outside the conductor the field is radial and identical to that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s center: E=(1/(4πε₀))·q/L² directed outward.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent d5gk, determining electrostatic conditions, thinking: When a point charge +q is placed off‐center in the cavity of an otherwise uncharged conductor, the conductor polarizes so that: (1) The inner cavity surface acquires an induced charge of –q distributed nonuniformly to keep E=0 in the metal. (2) The outer surface acquires +q so the net conductor charge remains zero. By Gauss’s law and the uniqueness theorem, the field inside the conductor’s metal is zero everywhere. Outside the conductor, only the net outer charge +q contributes, and by spherical symmetry of the overall conductor, the field is exactly that of a point charge +q located at the conductor’s center. Thus at any point P with distance L>R from the conductor’s center, E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L² directed radially outward.; answer: Electrostatic conditions:\n1. Inside the cavity: the electric field is non‐uniform, determined by the charge +q and the induced –q on the cavity wall.\n2. Within the conductor’s metal: E = 0 everywhere.\n3. On the outer surface: induced charge +q resides so the conductor’s net charge is zero.\n4. Outside the conductor (L > R): the field is identical to that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s center, E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L².\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent kC4R, determining electrostatic conditions, thinking: When a point charge +q is placed in an off-centre cavity of an uncharged conductor, the conductor must remain an equipotential and its interior field must be zero. By Gauss’s law, the total induced charge on the inner cavity surface is –q (to cancel field in the metal), and an equal +q appears on the outer surface. The –q distribution on the cavity wall is nonuniform (since the cavity is off-centre), but the +q on the exterior surface is uniformly spread over a spherical conductor. Outside, a Gaussian surface encloses net +q, so the field is that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s centre. Inside the conductor’s bulk, E=0; inside the cavity, E is determined by the off-centre charge plus induced surface charges (not uniform); at the outer surface, the induced +q yields a spherically symmetric field.  ; answer: Electrostatic conditions:\n1) Inside the conducting material (between cavity wall and outer surface): E=0, conductor is equipotential.\n2) On the inner cavity surface: total induced charge = –q, distributed non-uniformly to cancel field within the conductor.\n3) On the outer surface: total induced charge = +q, uniformly distributed over the spherical shell.\n4) Outside the conductor (at distance L>R): the field is spherically symmetric, E(L)= (1/4πε₀)·q/L² directed radially outward.\n5) Inside the cavity: E is nonzero and non-uniform, arising from +q and the induced –q surface charge distribution.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent RcaX, deducing electric field, thinking: By Gauss’s law, any Gaussian surface outside the conductor encloses net charge +q (–q induced inside cavity and +q on outer surface leave +q on exterior). The conductor shields the field inside its metal, making the outer surface equipotential, and the field outside is spherically symmetric about the conductor’s center regardless of the cavity’s off-center charge. Therefore at point P (distance L>R from center) the field is identical to that of a point charge +q at the center: E=(1/(4πε₀))·q/L² radially outward.; answer: E = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L²\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent jkzK, feedback: The deduction correctly invokes Gauss’s law and the shielding property of an ideal conductor: any net charge +q placed inside the cavity induces −q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface, so a Gaussian sphere at radius L>R encloses total charge +q. By spherical symmetry of the conductor’s outer surface, the field is E=(1/(4πε₀))·q/L² radially outward. Limitations: it assumes electrostatic equilibrium, a perfect spherical conductor with no other nearby charges or external fields, L>R, and that the conductor has reached equilibrium so that all induced charges reside on its surfaces. Time‐varying fields, non-ideal conductors, or additional external charges would invalidate this result.; correct: E=(1/(4πε₀))·q/L²\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent RcaX, refining deduction, thinking: By Gauss’s law, any spherical Gaussian surface of radius L>R around the conductor encloses net charge +q (–q induced on the cavity wall plus +q on the outer surface).
