            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question describes a hollow spherical conductor of radius R containing an off-center spherical cavity of radius r. The cavity\u2019s center is displaced by a vector s from the conductor\u2019s center. A point charge +q is placed inside the cavity. We observe points outside the conductor: point P is at a distance L from the conductor\u2019s center and at a distance l from the cavity center. The angle between the vector s (from conductor center to cavity center) and the vector from cavity center to P is \u03b8. These are all the geometric parameters and their relations.; answer - The given parameters are:\n\u2022 R: radius of the external spherical conductor\n\u2022 r: radius of the internal spherical cavity (r<R)\n\u2022 s: displacement vector magnitude between conductor center and cavity center\n\u2022 +q: point charge placed inside the cavity\n\u2022 L: distance from the conductor\u2019s center to the observation point P (L>R)\n\u2022 l: distance from the cavity\u2019s center to the observation point P (l>R)\n\u2022 \u03b8: angle between s (vector from conductor center to cavity center) and the vector from cavity center to P\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We know that in electrostatic equilibrium the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero and the conductor must be an equipotential. Placing a point charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge distribution of \u2013q on the inner cavity surface. Because the conductor as a whole is uncharged, +q must appear on the outer surface. By Gauss\u2019s law the net charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the conductor is +q, so the field outside is as if +q were located at the conductor\u2019s center. Inside the metal conductor E=0, on the cavity wall the surface charge density cancels the field in the conductor, and outside E is radial and falls off as 1/L2.; answer - Inside the conducting material E=0 and the conductor is an equipotential. A charge \u2013q is induced on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. Outside the conductor the field is radial and identical to that of a point charge +q at the conductor\u2019s center: E=(1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080))\u00b7q/L\u00b2 directed outward.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - By Gauss\u2019s law, any spherical Gaussian surface of radius L>R around the conductor encloses net charge +q (\u2013q induced on the cavity wall plus +q on the outer surface). The conductor\u2019s metal shields its interior and enforces spherical equipotential on the outer surface, making the external field spherically symmetric about the conductor\u2019s center. Thus the field at point P is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor\u2019s center.; answer - E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080))\u00b7q/L\u00b2 radially outward\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - By Gauss\u2019s law, any spherical Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L>R) encloses only the net charge +q. The conductor\u2019s outer surface is an equipotential sphere, so the external field is spherically symmetric about its center. All internal details\u2014the cavity offset s, cavity radius r, charge location l and angle \u03b8, and even the conductor\u2019s radius R\u2014do not affect the field outside. Therefore the field at P depends solely on the enclosed charge q and the radial distance L from the conductor\u2019s center.; answer - The electric field magnitude outside the conductor depends only on q and L (E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080))\u00b7q/L\u00b2) and is independent of R, r, s, l, and \u03b8.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - By Gauss\u2019s law, any Gaussian surface outside the conducting sphere encloses only the net charge +q. The conducting shell thus behaves like a point charge at its center for external points, making the field magnitude E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080))\u00b7q/L\u00b2, independent of the cavity\u2019s offset, radius, or the charge\u2019s position inside.
