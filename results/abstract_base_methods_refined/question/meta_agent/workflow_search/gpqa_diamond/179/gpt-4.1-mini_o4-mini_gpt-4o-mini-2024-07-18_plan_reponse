        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem statement describes an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each carrying charge 2e. It explicitly states that 12 of these charges are constrained to remain at a distance of 2 m from a central point P (i.e., on a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P), and the 13th charge is fixed at P itself. Since all particles are identical and of negligible mass, their only distinguishing features are charge magnitude and spatial constraints, which match the description given.; answer - The system consists of 13 identical charges of magnitude 2e each. One charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 charges are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To compute the electrostatic potential energy of this collection of point charges, we need the fundamental constants that quantify the interaction between electric charges and the formula that relates charge magnitudes and separations to energy. Coulomb\u2019s constant k provides the proportionality between product of charges and energy per unit distance. The elementary charge e gives the basic unit of charge from which each particle\u2019s charge (2e) is derived. The pairwise potential energy formula U = k q1 q2 / r then follows directly from Coulomb\u2019s law and superposition principle. For the entire system, we sum this expression over all unique charge pairs.; answer - The relevant constants and formulas are:\n\n1. Coulomb\u2019s constant: k = 8.988\u00d710^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2\n2. Elementary charge: e = 1.602\u00d710^-19 C  (so each charge is q = 2e = 3.204\u00d710^-19 C)\n3. Pairwise electrostatic potential energy between two point charges: U = k\u00b7q1\u00b7q2 / r\n4. Total potential energy for N charges: U_total = \u00bd \u03a3_{i\u2260j} [k\u00b7q_i\u00b7q_j / r_{ij}]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We need the pairwise energy between the central charge (q\u2081=2e) and one of the outer charges (q\u2082=2e) separated by r=2\u2009m. Using Coulomb\u2019s law: U=k\u00b7q\u2081\u00b7q\u2082/r, where k=8.988\u00d710\u2079\u2009N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2 and e=1.602\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079\u2009C. Thus q=2e=3.204\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079\u2009C, q\u00b2=(3.204\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079)\u00b2=1.0269\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2077\u2009C\u00b2.

Each of the 12 outer charges has this same interaction energy with the central charge.; answer - U (central\u2013each outer) = 4.616\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2078\u2009J\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To minimize mutual energy of 12 identical charges on a sphere, we use the solution of the Thomson problem for N=12: charges at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R=2\u2009m.  The total electrostatic potential energy is U\u2081\u2082 = k\u2009q\u00b2\u2009\u2211_{i<j}1/r_{ij}, where q=2e=3.204\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079\u2009C and k=8.988\u00d710\u2079\u2009N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2.  In an icosahedron there are 30 edge\u2010pair separations r\u2081=2R\u2009sin(\u03c0/5)\u22482.351\u2009m, 30 second\u2010neighbor separations r\u2082=2R\u2009sin(2\u03c0/5)\u22483.804\u2009m, and 6 opposite\u2010vertex separations r\u2083=2R=4\u2009m.

With 12 outer charges, total central\u2013outer energy is 12\u00b74.616\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2078 J = 5.5392\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2077 J. From subtask 4, the mutual energy among the 12 outer charges is U\u2084 \u2248 2.04\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2076 J.

This result is based on classical Coulomb interactions, point charges, and perfect icosahedral symmetry.; answer - 2.594\u00d710^-26 J\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We previously calculated the system\u2019s minimum electrostatic potential energy by summing the interactions between the central charge and the 12 outer charges and the mutual interactions among the 12 outer charges.
