Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_179
proposed answer: We previously calculated the system’s minimum electrostatic potential energy by summing the interactions between the central charge and the 12 outer charges and the mutual interactions among the 12 outer charges. That yielded U_total ≃ 2.822×10^–26 J (when computed precisely) or ≃2.594×10^–26 J (using an approximate summation), but in both cases the only provided option of the same order of magnitude and closest to our value is 2.822×10^–26 J. The other choices differ by orders of magnitude or are completely unphysical. Therefore the correct multiple-choice answer is A).
