Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_15_158
proposed answer: From sub-task 3 we obtained a comoving distance of â‰ƒ8.0 Gpc. The available choices are 6 Gpc (D), 7 Gpc (C), 8 Gpc (A), and 9 Gpc (B). Since 8.0 Gpc exactly matches option A), that is the closest value.
