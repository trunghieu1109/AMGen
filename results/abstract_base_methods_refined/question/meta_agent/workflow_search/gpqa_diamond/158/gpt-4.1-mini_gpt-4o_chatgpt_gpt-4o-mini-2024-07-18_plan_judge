proposed answer: The calculated comoving distance for the quasar, using the Lambda-CDM model parameters and a redshift of z = 5.5, is approximately 9 Gpc. This value is derived using the formula for comoving distance in a flat universe, taking into account the contributions from matter and dark energy density parameters. Among the given multiple-choice options (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 9 Gpc), the value of 9 Gpc is exactly one of the options provided. Therefore, the closest matching value to the calculated comoving distance is 9 Gpc. The majority of the debate agents, except for one, agree that the correct choice is 9 Gpc, which corresponds to choice B). The discrepancy with one agent choosing D) seems to be an error, as the correct index for 9 Gpc is indeed B).

proposed answer: The verified comoving distance for the quasar, calculated using the Lambda-CDM model parameters (Hubble constant 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter 0.3, dark energy density parameter 0.7, flat universe), is approximately 8.8 to 9 Gpc. This was confirmed by comparing with reference values from cosmology calculators. Among the given multiple-choice options, 9 Gpc is the closest match to the verified comoving distance. The other options, 6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, and 8 Gpc, are significantly lower and do not align with the calculated distance for a high-redshift quasar. Therefore, 9 Gpc is the most appropriate choice.
