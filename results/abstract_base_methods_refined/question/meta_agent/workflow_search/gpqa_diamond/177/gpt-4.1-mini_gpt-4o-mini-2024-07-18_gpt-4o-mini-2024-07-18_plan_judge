proposed answer: From the analysis of the previous sub-tasks, we have established that the mass dimension of the coupling constant \kappa is -1. Additionally, we concluded that a negative mass dimension indicates that the theory is not renormalizable. The only option that accurately reflects both the mass dimension of \kappa being -1 and the conclusion that the theory is not renormalizable is choice C, which states 'The mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.' Therefore, the correct answer is C.
