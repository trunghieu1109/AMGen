proposed answer: In four-dimensional spacetime a coupling with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction because higher-order loop diagrams will generate divergences that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. Here we found [κ]=−1, which is negative. By the standard power-counting criterion, only couplings with mass dimension ≥0 are renormalizable. Therefore, since κ has a negative dimension, this interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Answer:The theory is not renormalizable.

proposed answer: The operator in the interaction term is ψ̄σ_{μν}ψ F^{μν}. In four dimensions, ψ has mass dimension 3/2 and F^{μν} has dimension 2, so the combined operator has dimension 3/2+3/2+2=5. The Lagrangian density must have total dimension 4, hence κ must carry dimension 4−5=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension signals a non-renormalizable interaction in four dimensions. Among the provided options, only choice C states [κ]_M=−1 and non-renormalizable.
