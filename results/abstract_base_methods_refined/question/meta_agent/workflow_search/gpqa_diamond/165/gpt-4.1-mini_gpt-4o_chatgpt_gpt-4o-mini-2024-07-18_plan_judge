proposed answer: The task is to select the correct multiple-choice answer that corresponds to the derived formula for the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2. The derived formula should include contributions from various particles such as the Higgs boson (h_1), W and Z bosons, charged and neutral scalars (H^Â±, H^0, A^0), the top quark, and singlet fermions N_i. Each particle's contribution is represented by a term with a coefficient alpha_i, and the signs of these terms are crucial as they reflect whether the contribution is positive or negative in the context of one-loop radiative corrections. The correct formula must include terms for each contributing particle with appropriate coefficients and signs, consistent with the theoretical framework for one-loop corrections. All debate agents agree that choice 3 (option C) includes all relevant particles with appropriate signs and coefficients, aligning with the theoretical expectations for one-loop corrections. Therefore, choice 3 is the correct approximation for M_h_2^2.
