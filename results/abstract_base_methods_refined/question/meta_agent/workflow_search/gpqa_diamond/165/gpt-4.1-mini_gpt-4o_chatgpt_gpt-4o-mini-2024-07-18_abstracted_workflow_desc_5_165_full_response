These corrections typically depend on the masses of the particles involved and their couplings to the fields. The effective potential at one-loop level includes contributions from gauge bosons (W and Z bosons), scalars (Higgs boson h_1, charged scalars H^±, neutral scalars H^0, A^0), the top quark, and singlet fermions N_i. Each of these particles contributes a term proportional to M^4 log(M^2/μ^2) to the effective potential, where M is the mass of the particle and μ is the renormalization scale. The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 is determined by the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to the field corresponding to H_2, evaluated at the potential's minimum. The expression for the mass squared will be a sum of these contributions, each weighted by a coefficient alpha_i that reflects the particle's couplings and multiplicities. The correct expression is typically organized as a fraction involving 1/(8π^2(x^2 + v^2)), where x and v are the vacuum expectation values of the fields involved.; answer: M_{h_{2}}^{2}=\\frac{1}{8\\pi^{2}\\left(x^{2}+v^{2}\\right)}\\left\\{ \\alpha_{1}M_{h_{1}}^{4}+\\alpha_{2}M_{W}^{4}+\\alpha_{3}M_{Z}^{4}-\\alpha_{4}M_{t}^{4}+\\alpha_{5}M_{H^{\\pm}}^{4}+\\alpha_{6}M_{H^{0}}^{4}+\\alpha_{7}M_{A^{0}}^{4}-\\alpha_{8}\\sum M_{N_{i}}^{4}\\right\\}\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, deciding approximate formula for H_2 mass, thinking: The task is to determine the correct formula for the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 by considering one-loop radiative corrections from various particles.
