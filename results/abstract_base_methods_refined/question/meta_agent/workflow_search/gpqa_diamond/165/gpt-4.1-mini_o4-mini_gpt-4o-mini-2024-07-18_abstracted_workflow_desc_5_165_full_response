This involves noting that φ and H each carry a phase under the broken U(1), that one combination becomes the SM Higgs boson h₁ and the orthogonal combination is the would-be Goldstone which we call H₂, and that gauge, Yukawa, and scalar couplings break the symmetry explicitly and induce a small mass for H₂.; answer - In this model the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ originates from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate global U(1) symmetry under which the singlet scalar φ and the Higgs doublet H both transform. When φ and the SM Higgs acquire their VEVs x and v, two real scalar degrees of freedom mix: one combination becomes the observed SM‐like Higgs h₁, and the orthogonal combination is the would-be Goldstone mode. Because the global U(1) is only approximate—explicitly broken by gauge interactions (through H) and by Yukawa couplings (y_i and g_{iα})—this nominally massless Goldstone picks up a small mass radiatively and is called a pseudo-Goldstone boson, H₂. Its couplings to SM and new states are suppressed by the mixing angle θ∼v/√(x²+v²), so it is mostly the φ‐phase with only a small H admixture. Radiative corrections from loops of W, Z, top, the inert doublet S, and the singlet fermions N_i explicitly break the global symmetry and generate the H₂ mass at one loop, scaling as M_{H₂}²∼1/[8π²(x²+v²)]×(sum of fourth powers of particle masses weighted by their symmetry‐breaking couplings).

Thus H₂ is naturally light compared to the symmetry-breaking scale √(x²+v²).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Le6r, analyzing pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2, thinking: The user requests an analysis of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2: how it emerges from SSB, its link to φ and h VEVs, its mixing, and its small mass from explicit breaking. I will describe the approximate global symmetry, the two‐scalar system, the mass eigenstates H1/H2, the nature of H2 as pseudo‐Goldstone, and its couplings suppressed by mixing and radiatively induced mass.; answer: The field H₂ is the pseudo‐Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global U(1) symmetry in the scalar sector. Before symmetry breaking, the two real neutral scalars φ and the neutral component of the SM Higgs H can be rotated by a global phase. When φ acquires ⟨φ⟩=x and the Higgs acquires ⟨h⟩=v, this U(1) is broken and one combination of the two fields becomes the true Goldstone boson. However, because the global symmetry is only approximate—softly broken by Yukawa couplings y_i and gauge interactions—the would‐be Goldstone acquires a small mass and is therefore a pseudo‐Goldstone boson, denoted H₂. Concretely, φ and h mix via their mass matrix, yielding two mass eigenstates H₁ (mostly Higgs‐like) and H₂ (mostly singlet‐like). The mixing angle θ satisfies tan\u20092θ∼2λ_{Hφ} xv/(λ_H v²−λ_φ x²). H₂’s couplings to SM fields are suppressed by sin\u2009θ, while its couplings to N_iR are suppressed by cos\u2009θ. Because explicit breaking is weak, H₂’s tree‐level mass is nearly zero and is lifted only by loop corrections (e.g. from top, gauge bosons, scalar loops and sterile neutrinos), making it naturally light compared to other scalars in the theory.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ZGdN, analyzing pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2, thinking: The question asks for a detailed analysis of the pseudo–Goldstone boson H₂: how it appears in this extended scalar sector, its origin from spontaneous symmetry breaking, and its connections to the fields φ and h whose VEVs we called x and v. I recall from subtask 1 that φ and the SM Higgs doublet H each acquire VEVs, and that the tree-level scalar potential exhibits an accidental global symmetry in the φ–h field space. When both VEVs are nonzero, one linear combination of their phases is ‘eaten’ by the SU(2)×U(1) gauge bosons (the usual Goldstone modes for W and Z), while the orthogonal angle remains in the spectrum. In the absence of explicit breaking it would be massless. However, gauge and Yukawa interactions and radiative corrections break the global symmetry softly/explicitly and generate a small mass for this angular mode. This is the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Its couplings to SM particles arise only through mixing with the doublet component, suppressed by v/√(v²+x²), making it a naturally light scalar. Radiative loops of the heavy states—top quark, gauge bosons, heavy scalars and singlet fermions—generate its mass at one loop, leading to the Coleman–Weinberg–type expression given in the original question.; answer: In this model the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ is the light scalar associated with the broken approximate global symmetry rotating the phases of φ and the SM Higgs h. Concretely: when φ (a real singlet) gets a VEV x and the neutral component of the Higgs doublet H gets a VEV v, the scalar potential (before loop effects) has one exact global U(1) in the φ–h field space, whose spontaneous breaking would yield a massless Goldstone. Gauge interactions eat the would-be Goldstone from the Higgs doublet, and the orthogonal phase remains in the spectrum. Because gauge, Yukawa and scalar self-interactions break that global U(1) explicitly at loop level, this residual scalar acquires a small mass and becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson, denoted H₂. Its field direction is the angular mode in the (φ,h) space, orthogonal to the SM Higgs h₁. It couples to SM fields only via its mixing angle ∼v/√(v²+x²), thus naturally suppressed if x≫v. Radiative corrections from loops of W, Z, top quark, heavy scalar S components and singlet fermions Nᵢ generate its one-loop mass squared proportional to combinations of their masses⁴ over 8π²(x²+v²), explaining why H₂ can be light compared to the other new states.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent rXQX, reviewing radiative corrections framework, thinking: The user asks for a concise review of the one-loop framework that generates a pseudo-Goldstone mass in extended SM models.

In our model these are: the SM Higgs h₁, the SU(2) gauge bosons (W,Z), the top quark (the dominant SM fermion), the inert doublet scalars H±, H⁰, A⁰, and the singlet neutrinos N_i.  Each contributes a term ∝n_i\u2009M_i^4\u2009ln\u2009(M_i^2/μ^2) whose second derivative along the Goldstone direction yields a coefficient α_j for each mass^4.  Bosonic loops enter with + signs, fermionic loops with – signs.  The multiplicity factors and group‐theory factors are absorbed into the α_j, ensuring all contributions respect gauge and global symmetries.

At one loop, each bosonic degree of freedom contributes positively (with its multiplicity factor n_i>0) and each fermion negatively (n_i<0).  In our model these are: the SM Higgs h_1 (mixing into the pseudo‐Goldstone), the W and Z gauge bosons, the top quark, the inert‐doublet scalars H^±, H^0 and A^0, and the singlet neutrinos N_i.  Each α_i collects the logarithmic piece ln(M_i^2/μ^2)−C_i together with the spin and multiplicity factor.  No other states couple at tree level to the φ/H flat direction, so no additional masses appear.; answer: The one‐loop radiative mass for H_2 picks up the following terms:\n\n• α₁\u2009M_{h₁}^4  (SM-like Higgs, from the φ–h mixing)\n• α₂\u2009M_W^4    (charged gauge bosons)\n• α₃\u2009M_Z^4    (neutral gauge boson)\n• −α₄\u2009M_t^4   (top quark Yukawa, fermionic sign)\n• α₅\u2009M_{H^±}^4 (inert doublet charged scalar)\n• α₆\u2009M_{H^0}^4 (inert doublet CP‐even scalar)\n• α₇\u2009M_{A^0}^4 (inert doublet CP‐odd scalar)\n• −α₈\u2009∑_i\u2009M_{N_i}^4 (singlet neutrinos, fermionic sign)\n\nHere each α_i≃n_i[ln(M_i^2/μ^2)−C_i]/8π² encodes the appropriate degrees of freedom and log‐term for that species, ensuring the full set of contributions consistent with the model’s gauge and global symmetries.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent bRpN, round 0, comparing candidate formulas, thinking: We derived that the one‐loop Coleman–Weinberg correction for the pseudo‐Goldstone mass M_{h₂}² must include all bosonic contributions with + signs (h₁, W, Z, H⁺, H⁰, A⁰) and fermionic contributions with – signs (top quark, singlet neutrinos), with a common overall denominator 8π²(x²+v²).

However, it is only an approximation valid at leading one-loop order. Radiative corrections beyond one loop, large logarithms requiring renormalization-group improvement, finite threshold effects at heavy masses, and potential mixings with other scalars are omitted.
