Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To decide on the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂, we start with the Stefan–Boltzmann law: L=4πσR²T⁴. From earlier subtasks we have R₁/R₂=1.5. Observationally, both stars peak at the same λₘₐₓ, but Star₂ is receding at 700 km/s, causing a redshift z≈700/(3×10⁵)=0.00233. The observed λₘₐₓ is (1+z)λ₀ for Star₂, so its rest-frame temperature T₂ is higher by (1+z) compared to the naive value. Thus T₁/T₂=1/(1+z)≈0.9977 and (T₁/T₂)⁴≈0.9907. Therefore L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴=1.5²×0.9907≈2.23, matching choice D).
