Debate the possible answers and select the most accurate one. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1HyW:\nTo find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂, we use the Stefan–Boltzmann law: L=4πσR²T⁴. From Sub-task 2 we have equal temperatures (T₁=T₂), and from Sub-task 3 we have R₁/R₂=1.5. Thus\n\nL₁/L₂ = (4πσR₁²T₁⁴)/(4πσR₂²T₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (1.5)²·1 = 2.25.\n\nHowever, because Star₂ is receding at 700 km/s, its observed peak wavelength is slightly redshifted, leading to a minor correction in the derived temperature and thus in the luminosity ratio. Accounting for this Doppler shift yields a corrected ratio of about 2.23, matching choice D).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5bFZ:\nWe use the Stefan–Boltzmann law: L=4πσR²T⁴. From Sub-task 2: T₁=T₂. From Sub-task 3: R₁/R₂=1.5. Hence\nL₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴=(1.5)²·1⁴=2.25.\nNo other factors enter at this stage, so the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ewg8:\nTo compute L1/L2 we use Stefan–Boltzmann: L∝R²T⁴. From Sub-tasks: R1/R2=1.5. If both stars were at rest and had the same temperature, L1/L2=(1.5)²=2.25. However, Star_2 is receding at 700\u2009km/s, so its spectrum is redshifted: z=v/c≈700/3×10^5≈0.00233. We observe λmax the same, so the rest‐frame temperature of Star_2 must be higher by 1+z≈1.00233 to compensate. Thus the true temperature ratio is T1/T2=(1)/(1.00233), and L1/L2=(1.5)²×(1/1.00233)⁴≈2.25×0.9907≈2.23. This matches choice D).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent jGX7:\nUsing the Stefan–Boltzmann law L=4πσR²T⁴ and the results from earlier subtasks: T₁=T₂ (so T₁/T₂=1) and R₁/R₂=1.5. Therefore L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (1.5)²·1⁴ = 2.25. Among the provided choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the value 2.25 is exact given the radius ratio, so the most accurate answer is choice A.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 1HyW:\nD)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 5bFZ:\n2.25\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent ewg8:\nD)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent jGX7:\nA)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the luminosity ratio (L1/L2) of Star_1 to Star_2.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

The observed λ_peak are identical for both stars, so if we ignore relativistic Doppler effects the emitted λ_peak are the same and thus T1\u2009=\u2009T2, giving a ratio of 1. Even if we accounted for the 700\u2009km/s redshift of Star_2, the correction factor (1\u2009+\u2009v/c)≃1.00233 is so small that T2 would only differ by 0.23%, still yielding a ratio essentially equal to 1. Thus the most consistent temperature ratio is 1.; answer: T1/T2 = 1\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent AUfE, calculate temperature ratio, thinking: Wien’s displacement law states λ_peak·T = b, a constant. Since observations show both stars have the same peak emission wavelength, λ1 = λ2. Plugging into Wien’s law gives T1 = b/λ1 and T2 = b/λ2, which with λ1 = λ2 yields T1 = T2.

From Sub-task 2 we have T₁/T₂ = 1 (so T₁ = T₂), and from Sub-task 3 we have R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Therefore each star’s luminosity can be expressed directly in terms of its radius and temperature, and by substituting R₁ = 1.5\u2009R₂ and T₁ = T₂ one can prepare for the ratio calculation.; answer: L₁ = 4πσ\u2009R₁²\u2009T₁⁴,  L₂ = 4πσ\u2009R₂²\u2009T₂⁴  (with R₁ = 1.5\u2009R₂ and T₁ = T₂)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ZISA, express luminosity using Stefan-Boltzmann law, thinking: By the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the total power radiated per unit area of a black body is σT⁴. Multiplying by the star’s surface area (4πR²) gives its luminosity. From Sub-task 2 we have T₁/T₂=1, and from Sub-task 3 R₁/R₂=1.5.
