            "Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:",

The observed \u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093 is (1+z)\u03bb\u2080 for Star\u2082, so its rest-frame temperature T\u2082 is higher by (1+z) compared to the naive value.

Since both stars have the same observed \u03bb_peak, they must have the same temperature. No additional information is needed to see that T1 = T2.; answer - T1 = T2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Wien\u2019s displacement law states \u03bb_peak\u00b7T = constant. Since both stars have the same \u03bb_peak, they must have the same temperature. Therefore T1 = T2, giving a ratio T1/T2 = 1.; answer - 1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem statement explicitly states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. This directly gives the ratio of their radii: R\u2081/R\u2082 = 1.5.; answer - The radius ratio of Star_1 to Star_2 is 1.5.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law states that the luminosity L of a blackbody is L=4\u03c0\u03c3R\u00b2T\u2074, where \u03c3 is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant, R the radius, and T the effective temperature. From Sub-task 2 we have T\u2081=T\u2082, and from Sub-task 3 R\u2081/R\u2082=1.5. Thus preparing for the luminosity ratio, we write each star\u2019s luminosity in terms of its radius and temperature without yet substituting numerical values or cancelling terms.; answer - Luminosity of Star_1: L\u2081 = 4\u03c0\u03c3\u2009R\u2081\u00b2\u2009T\u2081\u2074\nLuminosity of Star_2: L\u2082 = 4\u03c0\u03c3\u2009R\u2082\u00b2\u2009T\u2082\u2074\n(with T\u2081=T\u2082 and R\u2081/R\u2082=1.5)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To decide on the luminosity ratio L\u2081/L\u2082, we start with the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law: L=4\u03c0\u03c3R\u00b2T\u2074.
