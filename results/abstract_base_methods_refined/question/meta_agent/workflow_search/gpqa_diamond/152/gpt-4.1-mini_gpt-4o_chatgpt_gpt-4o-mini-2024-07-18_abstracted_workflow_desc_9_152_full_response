These compounds are electrophilic at the β-carbon due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group, which makes the double bond more electrophilic. When a nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, it forms a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate. This is a key step in the Michael addition, as it allows for the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The reaction typically involves a soft nucleophile, such as an enolate ion, attacking the β-position of the α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of a 1,4-addition product.
