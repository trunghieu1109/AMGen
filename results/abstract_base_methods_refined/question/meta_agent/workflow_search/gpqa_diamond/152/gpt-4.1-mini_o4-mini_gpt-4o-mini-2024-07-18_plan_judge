Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: We predicted that the three reactions produce: 
A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (from dimethyl malonate + methyl p-tolyl acrylate), 
B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (from cyclohex-1-en-1-yl piperidine + but-2-enenitrile), 
and the nucleophile C in the third reaction is cyclohexane-1,3-dione which enolizes and Michael adds to but-3-en-2-one to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  Comparing to the four choices, only choice 4 (D) correctly lists A, B, and C as: 
• A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate  
• B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile  
• C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione
Therefore the correct answer is D).
