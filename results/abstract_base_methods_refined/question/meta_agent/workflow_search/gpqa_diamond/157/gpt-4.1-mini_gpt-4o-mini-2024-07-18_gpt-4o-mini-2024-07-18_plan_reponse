Therefore, while the wild-type protein can still dimerize with the mutant, it will not retain its wild-type function. \\n\\n- **Choice B (protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype)**: Protein aggregation could occur if the dimerization leads to misfolded proteins; however, this is not the most common outcome of dominant-negative mutations. Typically, dominant-negative mutations do not lead to aggregation as the primary mechanism of interference. \\n\\n- **Choice C (protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele)**: This is a strong possibility. The presence of the mutant protein can lead to the formation of dysfunctional dimers, which the cell may recognize as non-functional and subsequently target for degradation. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype for the wild-type allele, as the effective concentration of functional protein decreases. \\n\\n- **Choice D (change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype)**: This is unlikely because dominant-negative mutations typically do not enhance the function of the protein. Instead, they interfere with normal function, leading to a loss-of-function rather than a gain-of-function phenotype. \\n\\nOverall, choice C is the most plausible outcome in this scenario, as it aligns with the mechanisms of dominant-negative mutations and the expected consequences on protein function.', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"You are a Science Generalist.\\n\\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
