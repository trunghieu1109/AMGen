Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_157
proposed answer: The presence of mutation Y in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor is expected to have a dominant-negative effect, which means it interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Dimerization is crucial for the transcription factor's activity, and mutation Y likely prevents the formation of functional dimers. This disruption can lead to the formation of non-functional complexes and may also promote the degradation of the wild-type protein, as the cellular machinery might recognize the improperly assembled proteins as defective. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele'. This aligns with the provided answer choices, particularly choice 3, which specifically states this outcome, making it the correct answer.

Answer:protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele

proposed answer: In the context of dominant-negative mutations, particularly with mutation Y in the dimerization domain, the presence of the mutant protein leads to the formation of non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein. This results in the wild-type protein being unable to perform its normal function. The cell may recognize these dysfunctional complexes and target them for degradation, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype for the wild-type allele. This aligns with the characteristics of dominant-negative mutations, where the presence of the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often resulting in degradation of the non-functional complexes. Therefore, the most plausible outcome is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', which corresponds to choice C.
