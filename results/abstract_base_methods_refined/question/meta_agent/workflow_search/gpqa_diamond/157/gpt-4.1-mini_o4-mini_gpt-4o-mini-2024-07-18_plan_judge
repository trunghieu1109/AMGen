Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_157
proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain yields mutant subunits that still dimerize with wild-type monomers, forming inactive complexes. These mixed dimers effectively sequester functional protein into nonfunctional aggregates, abolishing transcriptional activity. Options A, C, and D conflict with this mechanism—A) implies no dimerization, C) requires degradation rather than sequestration, and D) suggests a gain of function—so B) correctly describes protein aggregation and loss-of-function.
