Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The question involves a dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor. A dominant-negative mutation typically results in a loss-of-function phenotype by interfering with the function of the wild-type protein. In this case, mutation Y likely causes the formation of non-functional dimers between the mutant and wild-type proteins, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. The presence of the mutant protein can also cause protein aggregation, which further contributes to the loss of function. Evaluating the options: Choice 1 suggests a wild-type phenotype, which is incorrect because the presence of mutation Y leads to a loss-of-function phenotype due to dominant-negative interference. Choice 2 suggests protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype, which aligns with the predicted molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y. Choice 3 suggests protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, but the scenario describes interference with function rather than degradation. Choice 4 suggests a gain-of-function phenotype, which contradicts the loss-of-function nature of the dominant-negative mutation. Therefore, the most likely observed molecular phenotype in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype.
