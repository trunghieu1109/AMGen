proposed answer: To verify the combined probability, we need to recompute it from first principles. The state of the system is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The operator P is represented by the matrix with rows (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The operator Q is represented by the matrix with rows (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), and (0, 0, -1). First, we find the probability of measuring P = 0. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 for P is (0, 1, 0). The probability of measuring P = 0 is the square of the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector. The projection is (0, 1, 0) dot (-1, 2, 1) = 2, and the norm of (0, 1, 0) is 1, so the probability is |2|^2 = 4. However, we must normalize by the norm of the state vector, which is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(6). Thus, the probability is (2/sqrt(6))^2 = 4/6 = 2/3. Next, given P = 0, the state collapses to (0, 1, 0). The probability of measuring Q = -1 is the square of the projection of (0, 1, 0) onto the eigenvector of Q corresponding to -1, which is (0, 0, 1). The projection is 0, so the probability is 0. Therefore, the combined probability of measuring P = 0 and then Q = -1 is (2/3) * 0 = 0. This is inconsistent with the previous calculation of 1/18, indicating an error in the previous steps. The correct combined probability is 0, which matches none of the given choices.
