Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the electron’s energy, we use the kinetic energy–momentum relation E = p²/(2m). For small uncertainties, dE ≃ (dE/dp)·Δp, and since dE/dp = p/m = v, we get ΔE ≃ v·Δp. From Sub‐task 3, Δp ≃ 5.3×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s and the electron’s speed is v = 2×10⁸ m/s. Multiplying gives ΔE ≃ (2×10⁸ m/s)·(5.3×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) = 1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J. This approximation neglects higher‐order relativistic corrections but sets the correct order of magnitude.

Answer:ΔE ≈ 1.06×10^−16 J

proposed answer: We have determined the minimum energy uncertainty ΔE_min ≃ 1.1×10^−16 J. Comparing this to the provided options: 
- ~10^−19 J (A) is too small by three orders of magnitude,
- ~10^−18 J (B) is too small by two orders of magnitude,
- ~10^−17 J (D) is too small by one order of magnitude,
- ~10^−16 J (C) matches within a factor of order unity.
Thus the closest match is ~10^−16 J, corresponding to choice C.
