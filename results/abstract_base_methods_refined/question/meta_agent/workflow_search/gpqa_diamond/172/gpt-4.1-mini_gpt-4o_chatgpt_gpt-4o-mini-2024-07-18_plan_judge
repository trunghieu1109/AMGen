proposed answer: The task is to determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron given its uncertainty in position (Δx) and speed. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m, we can calculate Δp. Using ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10^-34 J·s, we find Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.054 x 10^-34 J·s / (2 x 0.1 x 10^-9 m) = 5.27 x 10^-25 kg·m/s. The electron's speed is v = 2 x 10^8 m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects should be considered. The relativistic relation for energy is E = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2), but for small uncertainties, ΔE ≈ v * Δp is a good approximation. Substituting the values, ΔE ≈ (2 x 10^8 m/s) * (5.27 x 10^-25 kg·m/s) = 1.054 x 10^-16 J. This matches the order of magnitude of choice C) ~10^(-16) J. Therefore, the best choice is C) ~10^(-16) J.
