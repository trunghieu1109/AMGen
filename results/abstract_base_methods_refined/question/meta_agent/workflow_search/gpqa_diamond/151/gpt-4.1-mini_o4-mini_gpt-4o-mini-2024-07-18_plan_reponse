            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",

        "response": "The pre-replication complex (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM helicase) is specifically assembled at origins during G1 to license DNA replication and is not stably associated with actively transcribed, open chromatin in shmooing yeast. In contrast, the pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complexes, and nucleosome histones all localize to or remain bound at active promoters and enhancers during mating-induced transcription. Therefore, ChIP-MS of active chromatin will least recover the replication-specific pre-replication complex.\n\nAnswer:B)",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question asks to identify three elements: the quorum-sensing peptide, its treatment on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the observed shmoo formation. From the original experiment, we know a novel peptide was discovered in Lactobacillus acidophilus and applied exogenously to yeast cells. The morphological change observed in the yeast\u2014shmoo formation\u2014is the classic mating projection response, indicating activation of the pheromone signaling pathway. Thus, the context is: a new L. acidophilus quorum-sensing peptide is used to treat S. cerevisiae, and the shmoo reflects the yeast\u2019s cellular response to that peptide.; answer - The quorum-sensing peptide is the newly identified peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus; it was applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures, and the observed shmoo formation indicates activation of the yeast mating pheromone response.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Active chromatin pulled down by ChIP/MS from shmooing cells will be enriched for factors involved in transcription and accessible nucleosomes: histones, transcription pre\u2010initiation components (e.g. TBP, Pol II), and enhancer\u2010binding proteins/coactivators at active promoters. In contrast, origin\u2010licensing factors (pre\u2010replication complex members like ORC and MCM) are bound at replication origins in G1 and not specifically enriched at actively transcribed genes in shmooing cells. Therefore, the proteins from the pre\u2010replication complex will be the least represented in the assay.; answer - pre-replication complex\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The pre-initiation complex (PIC) includes RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors that assemble at promoters of active genes, so they will be abundant in ChIP\u2010MS of active chromatin. Enhancer protein complexes (sequence\u2010specific transcription activators and coactivators) bind regulatory elements to boost transcription and will co\u2010purify with active regions. Core nucleosome histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) remain associated with DNA even in highly active chromatin and are routinely recovered in ChIP assays. In contrast, the pre\u2010replication complex (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM helicase) assembles specifically at replication origins during G1 and is not stably associated with actively transcribed loci during the shmoo (mating) response. Although replication factors could transiently interact during S phase or under stress, they will be the least enriched in an assay targeting actively transcribed, open chromatin in shmooing cells.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The pre-replication complex (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM helicase) is specifically assembled at origins during G1 to license DNA replication and is not stably associated with actively transcribed, open chromatin in shmooing yeast.
