Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_39_151
proposed answer: In the context of the assay involving chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry on active chromatin from shmoo cells treated with the quorum-sensing peptide, we need to evaluate the expected presence of various protein complexes. The pre-initiation complex is crucial for transcription initiation and is likely to be present due to the active gene expression associated with shmoo formation. The enhancer protein complex is also expected to be present as it enhances transcription. The nucleosome histone complex, while part of the chromatin structure, does not specifically indicate active transcription but is still part of the chromatin landscape. However, the pre-replication complex is primarily involved in DNA replication and does not play a direct role in transcriptional activity. Therefore, it is the least likely to be observed in the assay of active chromatin in shmoo cells, making it the correct answer.
