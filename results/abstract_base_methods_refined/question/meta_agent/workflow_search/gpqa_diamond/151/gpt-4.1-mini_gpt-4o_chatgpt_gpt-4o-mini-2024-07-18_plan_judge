Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: Based on the analysis in Sub-task 5, the pre-replication complex is associated with DNA replication origins and not with transcriptionally active regions. In contrast, the pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are all associated with transcriptional activity and active chromatin. Therefore, the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be observed in a ChIP-MS assay targeting active chromatin, as the focus is on transcriptional activity rather than replication.
