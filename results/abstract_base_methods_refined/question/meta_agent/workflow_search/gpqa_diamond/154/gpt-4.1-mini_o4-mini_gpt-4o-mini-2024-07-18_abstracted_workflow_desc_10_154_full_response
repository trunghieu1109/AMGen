However, this conclusion hinges entirely on the prior calculation being error-free and assumes the measurement basis and normalization are exact. Any small algebraic slip or alternative phase convention in the eigenvector representation could alter the result. Moreover, the multiple-choice format hides the dependence on the state’s global phase and normalization conventions, which may lead to ambiguity in more general contexts.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compare the computed uncertainty ΔPz with the given multiple-choice options and select the correct answer choice, based on the output from Sub-task 5.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
