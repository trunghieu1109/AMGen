            "Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$",

No additional derivation is needed: we simply restate these matrices as 3\u00d73 arrays with the given entries. This confirms that we have correctly identified each operator in the specified basis.; answer - P_x = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} & 0 \\\\[6pt] \\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} & 0 & \\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} \\\\[6pt] 0 & \\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n\nP_y = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i\\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} & 0 \\\\[6pt] i\\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} & 0 & -i\\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} \\\\[6pt] 0 & i\\tfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n\nP_z = \\begin{pmatrix}\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem states that the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u210f, which is explicitly given by the column vector (\u20131/2, 1/\u221a2, \u20131/2) in the P_z eigenbasis. To verify normalization, compute the sum of squared magnitudes: |\u20131/2|^2 + |1/\u221a2|^2 + |\u20131/2|^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Thus the state is normalized.; answer - The state vector in the P_z eigenbasis is\n(\u20131/2, 1/\u221a2, \u20131/2)^T,\nand it is normalized since (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020\u2009Pz\u2009\u03c8.

From Sub-task 3 we found \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = 0 because the expectation value of Pz in the given state vanishes. From Sub-task 4 we found \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 = \u210f\u00b2/2. Plugging in, \u0394Pz = sqrt(\u210f\u00b2/2 \u2013 0\u00b2) = \u210f/\u221a2.
