To express this vector in the Pz eigenbasis, we need to confirm that the basis vectors corresponding to Pz are indeed the standard basis vectors in this case (eigenvectors of Pz). The normalization of the state vector can be checked by calculating its norm, which should equal 1 for a normalized state. The norm is calculated as sqrt((-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4) = sqrt(1) = 1, confirming that the vector is normalized. Thus, the explicit form of the state vector in the Pz eigenbasis is confirmed as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).; answer - The explicit form of the system state vector in the Pz eigenbasis is given by the column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value of the operator Pz, we use the formula \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|Pz|\u03c8\u27e9, where |\u03c8\u27e9 is the state vector of the system. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The operator Pz is represented by the matrix [[hbar, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -hbar]]. First, we compute the product Pz|\u03c8\u27e9.

Next, we apply this squared operator to the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). We compute Pz\u00b2|\u03c8\u27e9, which gives us the resulting vector. Finally, the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is calculated as \u27e8\u03c8|Pz\u00b2|\u03c8\u27e9, which involves taking the inner product of the state vector with the resulting vector from the application of Pz\u00b2.

Substituting these values into the formula gives us \u0394Pz = sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2 - 0\u00b2) = sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127/\u221a2. This result indicates the inherent uncertainty in the measurement of the operator Pz, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics. The non-zero uncertainty reflects the limitations imposed by the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of observables cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. Therefore, the uncertainty \u0394Pz quantifies the spread of possible measurement outcomes for Pz, emphasizing the probabilistic nature of quantum states and the intrinsic limitations of measurement in quantum mechanics.; answer - \u0127/\u221a2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The computed uncertainty \u0394Pz is \u0127/\u221a2, which matches with choice3 from the provided options.
