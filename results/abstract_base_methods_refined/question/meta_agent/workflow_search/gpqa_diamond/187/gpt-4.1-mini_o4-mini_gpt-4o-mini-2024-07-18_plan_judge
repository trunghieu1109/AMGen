Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_187
proposed answer: The computed interplanar distance (~6.75 Å) was compared with the four options: 9.54 Å (Δ=2.79 Å), 8.95 Å (Δ=2.20 Å), 9.08 Å (Δ=2.33 Å), and 10.05 Å (Δ=3.30 Å). The smallest deviation is with 8.95 Å, which corresponds to choice B).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_187
proposed answer: To identify the closest matching value to the computed interplanar distance (1.495 Å), I calculated the absolute differences: |9.54−1.495|≈8.045, |8.95−1.495|≈7.455, |9.08−1.495|≈7.585, |10.05−1.495|≈8.555. The smallest deviation is for 8.95 Å, which corresponds to choice B.
