In this case, the interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom, and the angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees. We need to convert these angles to radians for calculations and use the cosine values accordingly. The Miller indices for the (111) plane are h = 1, k = 1, l = 1. Substituting these values into the formula will allow us to compute the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal system.; answer: d_hkl = (10 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2 * cos(30°) * 1 * 1 + 2 * cos(30°) * 1 * 1 + 2 * cos(30°) * 1 * 1))\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent SfEn, recalling formula, thinking: To calculate the interplanar spacing (d_hkl) for a rhombohedral crystal system, we use the formula: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), where a is the interatomic distance and (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane.

For the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1. The lattice parameter a is given as 10 Angstrom. Since α = β = γ = 30°, we can find sin(θ) where θ is the angle between the normal to the (111) plane and the lattice vector. The calculation proceeds as follows: d_111 = (10 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)) * (1 / sin(30°). The value of sin(30°) is 0.5, and sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. Therefore, d_111 = (10 / 1.732) * (1 / 0.5) = (10 / 1.732) * 2 = 11.55 / 1.732 = 6.67 Angstrom. However, the correct computation for the (111) plane interplanar spacing with the provided options leads us to the closest available choice.

Here, we have the parameters: interatomic distance a = 10 Angstrom, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 for the (111) plane, and the angles α = β = γ = 30°. First, we calculate sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3). Next, we need to find sin(θ). For a rhombohedral system with angles of 30°, we can use θ = 30° for our calculations. Thus, sin(30°) = 0.5. Now we can substitute these values into the formula: d_111 = (10 / sqrt(3)) * (1 / 0.5) = (10 / sqrt(3)) * 2 = 20 / sqrt(3). Calculating this gives approximately 11.55 Angstrom. However, since the options provided are different, I will check the calculations again to ensure accuracy. The formula and inputs are consistent, and the calculated result aligns with the understanding of the rhombohedral structure.

In this case, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 1 for the (111) plane. The interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom. The angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees, thus θ is also 30 degrees. We can calculate the interplanar distance d_111 as follows: d_111 = (10 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)) * (1 / sin(30°)). The value of sin(30°) is 0.5, and sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. Therefore, d_111 = (10 / 1.732) * (1 / 0.5) = (10 / 1.732) * 2 = 11.547 / 1.732 = 6.67 Angstrom. This value does not match any of the provided choices, indicating a potential error in the calculations or assumptions about the crystal structure.

For the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1. Therefore, h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3. The interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom. The angles α, β, and γ are all 30°, which means θ = 30°. The sine of 30° is 0.5. Plugging these values into the formula: d_111 = (10 / sqrt(3)) * (1 / 0.5) = (10 / 1.732) * 2 = 11.547 Angstrom.
