Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_192
proposed answer: From the cumulative relation N(r)∝r^5, the number per unit distance is its derivative: dN/dr∝5r^4, so ∝r^4. Among the choices (~r^2, ~r^4, ~r^3, ~r^5), only ~r^4 matches.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_192
proposed answer: We know the observed star count per unit parallax varies as N(plx)∝1/plx^5, and parallax plx=1/r. To convert to count per unit distance r, we use N(r)=N(plx(r))·|d(plx)/dr|. Substituting plx=1/r gives N(plx(r))∝(1/(1/r))^5=r^5, and |d(1/r)/dr|=1/r^2. Multiplying yields N(r)∝r^5·(1/r^2)=r^3. Among the choices (~r^2, ~r^4, ~r^3, ~r^5), only ~r^3 matches, which is choice C.
