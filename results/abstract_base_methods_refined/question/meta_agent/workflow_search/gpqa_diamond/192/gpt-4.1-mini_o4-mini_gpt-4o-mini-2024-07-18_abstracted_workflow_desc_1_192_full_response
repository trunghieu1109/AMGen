In astronomy (with r in parsecs and plx in arcseconds), plx = 1/r. To change variables in the distribution N(plx), we also need the Jacobian d(plx)/d(r), which follows directly from differentiating 1/r. Using the power rule, d(1/r)/dr = -1 * r^(–2) = -1/r^2.

Thus N(r)=N(plx(r))·|d(plx)/d(r)|=(1/(1/r)^5)·(1/r^2)=r^5·1/r^2=r^3. This gives the differential number density per unit distance. For the cumulative number up to distance R, integrate: ∫0^R N(r)dr=∫0^R r^3 dr=R^4/4, so N(<R)∝R^4.

Dimensionally this is consistent (stars per unit distance). However, the premise N(plx)∝1/plx^5 implies a space density ∝r, which is unphysical for a uniform stellar population.
