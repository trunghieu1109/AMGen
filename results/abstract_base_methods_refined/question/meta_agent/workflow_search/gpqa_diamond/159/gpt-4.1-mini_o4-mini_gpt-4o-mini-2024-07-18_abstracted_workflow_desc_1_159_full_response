The apothem a remains the distance from the polygon’s center to each side; in the limit, every point on the boundary is at distance a from the center. Thus the polygon’s shape converges to a circle of radius a.

The apothem a is the distance from the center to each side, and as the sides become infinitesimal, every point on the boundary lies at distance a from the center.
