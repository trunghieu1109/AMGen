Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: From the far‐field diffraction pattern of a circular (N→∞) aperture, the first two minima occur at angles given by the first two zeros of J1: j1,1≈3.8317 and j1,2≈7.0156, so θ1 = j1,1 λ/(2πa) ≈0.61 λ/a and θ2 = j1,2 λ/(2πa) ≈1.12 λ/a. Their separation Δθ = θ2–θ1 ≈(1.12–0.61) λ/a =0.51 λ/a. More precisely Δθ = (j1,2–j1,1)λ/(2πa) =3.1839 λ/(2πa) ≈0.506 λ/a, which matches choice D.
