In this limit, the curvature of the sides of the polygon becomes negligible, and the polygon can be approximated as a circle. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides, and as N becomes very large, this distance becomes equivalent to the radius of the circle that the polygon approximates. Therefore, when N is infinitely large, the polygonal aperture can be treated as a circular aperture with a radius equal to the apothem length 'a'.
