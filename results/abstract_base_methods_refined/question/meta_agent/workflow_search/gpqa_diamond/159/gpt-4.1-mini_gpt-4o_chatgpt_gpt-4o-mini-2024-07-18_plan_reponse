The first minimum is at \u03b8_1 = 1.22 \u03bb / D, and the second minimum is at \u03b8_2 = 2.23 \u03bb / D.

The limit condition N \u2192 \u221e is crucial because it simplifies the problem to that of a circular aperture, which is a common scenario in diffraction problems.; answer - The aperture is an N-sided polygon with apothem length 'a', the light has wavelength '\u03bb', it travels along the z-axis, and the limit condition is N \u2192 \u221e.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon becomes indistinguishable from a circle because the number of sides is so large that the polygon's perimeter becomes a smooth curve. In this limit, each side of the polygon becomes infinitesimally small, and the apothem, which is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side, effectively becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the limiting shape of the polygon as N tends to infinity is a circle with radius equal to the apothem length 'a'. This transformation simplifies the diffraction problem, as the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is well understood and characterized by Bessel functions, leading to a known angular distance between intensity minima.; answer - As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem length 'a'.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern in the far field is described by the Airy pattern, which is characterized by a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric rings of light and dark. The intensity minima occur at specific angular positions, which are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1. The first minimum occurs at an angle \u03b8 where the argument of the Bessel function is approximately 3.8317.

The second minimum occurs at a larger angle corresponding to the next zero of the Bessel function.
