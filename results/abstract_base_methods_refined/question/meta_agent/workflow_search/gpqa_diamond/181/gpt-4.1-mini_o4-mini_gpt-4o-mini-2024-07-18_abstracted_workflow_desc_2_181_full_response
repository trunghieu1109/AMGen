To isolate the V²/L³ behavior one must assume that only one carrier type contributes (electrons or holes), that the bulk contains no traps to capture carriers, and that injection from the electrodes is barrier‐free (Ohmic contacts) so the injected carrier density overwhelms any thermally generated background. Diffusion currents and recombination are neglected, meaning drift under the self‐consistent space charge dominates. Mobility and permittivity are uniform, and steady‐state conditions apply.

That derivation assumes that the injected carriers dominate the device, so only one carrier type (electron or hole) is present and traps are negligible (trap‐free). It also assumes ideal Ohmic contacts so there is no injection barrier and the carrier density at the contact is high. Under those conditions the current is limited by the space charge of the injected carriers and diffusion is negligible compared to drift. The geometry is taken to be one‐dimensional and steady‐state, with uniform ε and μ throughout the layer and no recombination or other limiting mechanisms.; answer: The Mott–Gurney equation applies under these conditions: 1) Single‐carrier, trap‐free transport (only electrons or holes, no traps). 2) Ohmic contacts providing barrier‐free, efficient injection. 3) Drift‐dominated current (negligible diffusion contribution). 4) Steady‐state, one‐dimensional planar geometry with uniform permittivity and mobility. 5) No other limiting mechanisms (e.g., recombination or injection barriers).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Q11G, identifying assumptions for Mott-Gurney validity, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law is derived by solving Poisson’s equation and the continuity/drift equations for a one‐dimensional, steady‐state device under the following conditions: (1) only one type of charge carrier is injected (single‐carrier regime), so there’s no recombination with opposite carriers; (2) the bulk is free of traps, meaning injected carriers are not captured and subsequently released, so mobility is constant and no trap‐filling effects occur; (3) contacts are Ohmic (injection barrier ≈0) so injection is efficient and space charge builds up; (4) diffusion currents are negligible compared to drift currents (high field regime); (5) current is limited by the space charge of injected carriers, yielding J∝V²/L³. These assumptions ensure the closed‐form Mott–Gurney expression J = (9/8) ε μ V²/L³ is valid.; answer: The key assumptions are that the device is trap-free, single-carrier, has Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier), and operates in a regime where drift dominates (negligible diffusion current).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Hz4x, analyzing choice statements, thinking: We compare each choice against the required assumptions for the Mott–Gurney law: single‐carrier transport, trap‐free bulk, Ohmic (zero‐barrier) contacts, negligible diffusion current (drift dominates), and steady‐state SCLC. Choice A (The Mott–Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current) exactly matches: single carrier, trap‐free, Ohmic contact (no barrier), and diffusion negligible. Choice B (trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current) contradicts the need for drift to dominate over diffusion, so it’s invalid. Choice C (two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current) violates the single‐carrier assumption. Choice D (single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current) violates the zero‐barrier (Ohmic) injection requirement. Thus only A is correct.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 6fe8, providing feedback, thinking: The provided analysis correctly identifies that only choice A meets all key Mott–Gurney conditions (trap‐free, single‐carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion). Its main limitations lie in its idealized assumptions: it ignores real‐world complications such as nonzero injection barriers at contacts, field‐dependent or position‐dependent mobility, trap states with nonuniform energy distributions, diffusion contributions under low fields, recombination processes, and space‐charge effects in nonuniform geometries. These effects can invalidate the simple J∝V² law in practical devices.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Hz4x, refining analysis of choice statements, thinking: To determine which choice matches the Mott–Gurney equation’s validity conditions, we compare each against the key assumptions: single‐carrier transport, trap‐free bulk, Ohmic (barrier‐free) contacts for efficient injection, and negligible diffusion current so that drift under space charge dominates. \n\nChoice A: “trap‐free single‐carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.” This exactly matches all required assumptions: trap‐free, single‐carrier, Ohmic contact (no barrier), and diffusion negligible.\n\nChoice B: “trap‐free single‐carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.” This contradicts the requirement that drift (not diffusion) dominates; neglecting drift makes no physical sense for SCLC.\n\nChoice C: “two‐carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.” Violates single‐carrier assumption; mixing both carriers alters space‐charge distribution and current law.\n\nChoice D: “single‐carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.” A Schottky (barrier) contact prevents barrier‐free injection, violating the Ohmic contact condition.\n\nTherefore only Choice A satisfies all the assumptions for the classic Mott–Gurney law.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent QZiC, round 0, selecting correct choice, thinking: Based on the key assumptions of the Mott–Gurney law—trap-free single-carrier transport, barrier-free (Ohmic) injection, and negligible diffusion current—only Choice A matches all these conditions.
