Question: Example(question='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n', choice1='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.', choice2='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.', choice3='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.', choice4='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Mottâ€“Gurney equation applies under space-charge-limited conditions with a trap-free medium, single-carrier transport, barrier-free (Ohmic) contacts for efficient injection, and negligible diffusion current so that drift dominates. Choice A is the only option that explicitly states all these required conditions (trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier, negligible diffusion). The other choices each violate at least one key assumption (neglecting drift in B, two-carrier transport in C, or a Schottky barrier in D).
