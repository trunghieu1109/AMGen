These conditions include: 1) The device is a single-carrier type, meaning only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is considered. 2) The device is trap-free, implying there are no energy states within the bandgap that can capture and release carriers, which would otherwise affect the current flow. 3) There is no significant barrier to carrier injection, meaning the contacts are Ohmic and allow carriers to be injected freely into the device without resistance. 4) The current is dominated by drift due to the electric field, and diffusion current is negligible. These assumptions ensure that the current is limited by the space charge effect, where the injected charge carriers create an electric field that limits further current flow.
