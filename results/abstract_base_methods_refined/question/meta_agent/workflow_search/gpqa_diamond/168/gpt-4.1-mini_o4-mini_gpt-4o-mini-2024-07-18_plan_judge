Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original 4-body decay, the two E’s and two V’s share the fixed Q energy, yielding a continuous E spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two (nonzero-mass) V’s with a single massless M reduces the final state to three bodies. Three-body decays still produce continuous spectra, but with a different phase-space–determined shape. Furthermore, removing the small masses of the V’s releases extra kinetic energy, raising the maximum total energy available to the E’s above the original endpoint Q. Hence the spectrum remains continuous, its shape is adjusted, and the endpoint increases, corresponding to choice C.
