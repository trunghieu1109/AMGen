proposed answer: After analyzing the spectral data and the provided options, 2-chlorobenzoic acid is the best match. The molecular weight of 156 g/mol corresponds to 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. The IR spectrum indicates the presence of an -OH group and a carbonyl group, typical for carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR data shows a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, consistent with a di-substituted aromatic compound. Other options do not fit the spectral data as well, particularly regarding the carboxylic acid proton and molecular weight. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

proposed answer: Upon reviewing the spectral data again, it is important to consider the characteristics of each option. 2-chlorobenzoic acid (choice B) fits the molecular weight and the spectral data perfectly. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 aligns with its molecular formula C7H6ClO2. The IR spectrum supports the presence of a carboxylic acid with the broad O-H stretch and the carbonyl peak. The 1H NMR data also matches the expected pattern for 2-chlorobenzoic acid, with the singlet for the carboxylic acid proton and the doublets indicating the substitution pattern. In contrast, 4-chlorobenzoic acid (choice A) would not produce the same NMR pattern due to its para substitution, which would lead to different splitting. 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (choice C) does not match the molecular weight and has different functional groups, while phenyl chloroformate (choice D) also does not fit the expected molecular weight or functional groups. Therefore, after careful consideration, 2-chlorobenzoic acid remains the only viable option that fits all the spectral data provided, confirming that choice B is indeed the correct answer.
