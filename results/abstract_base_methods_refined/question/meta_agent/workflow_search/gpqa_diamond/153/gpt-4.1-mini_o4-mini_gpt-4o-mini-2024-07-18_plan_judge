Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion at m/z 156 with a significant M+2 peak (~32%) indicates a single chlorine atom (3:1 Cl isotopic pattern). The IR spectrum shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ stretch and a sharp C=O peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, diagnostic of a carboxylic acid. In the ¹H NMR, the singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) corresponds to the acidic COOH proton. The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) with equal integration and J≈8 Hz, an AA′BB′ pattern indicative of para substitution on a benzene ring. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits a para-disubstituted benzoic acid with one chlorine, matching all spectral data.
