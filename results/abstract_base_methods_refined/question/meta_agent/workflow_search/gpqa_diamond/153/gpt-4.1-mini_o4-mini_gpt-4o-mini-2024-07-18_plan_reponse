        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The mass spectrum shows a base peak (100% intensity) at m/z = 156, which corresponds to the molecular ion (M+), so the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu. There is a secondary peak at m/z = 158 with about 32% relative intensity. A peak two mass units higher than the molecular ion is characteristic of the presence of chlorine, because 35Cl (\u224875% abundance) gives the M+ peak, while 37Cl (\u224825% abundance) gives the M+2 peak. The roughly 3:1 ratio of the peaks (100% at 156 vs. ~32% at 158) matches the natural abundance ratio of 35Cl to 37Cl, indicating exactly one chlorine atom in the molecule.; answer - Molecular weight = 156 amu; the M+2 peak at m/z 158 (~32% intensity) arises from 37Cl, confirming one chlorine atom present.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The IR spectrum shows a very broad absorption from 3500\u20132700 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is characteristic of the hydrogen\u2010bonded O\u2013H stretch of a carboxylic acid, rather than an alcohol (which would appear as a narrower band around 3300 cm\u207b\u00b9). The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carbonyl. Taken together, these two features\u2014broad O\u2013H plus strong C=O\u2014are diagnostic of a carboxylic acid functional group.; answer - Carboxylic acid functional group\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The IR data (Sub-task 2) established a carboxylic acid functional group. In the 1H NMR, the broad singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to one proton is characteristic of the \u2013COOH hydrogen, which is strongly deshielded by hydrogen bonding and the adjacent carbonyl. The two aromatic signals are each doublets integrating to two protons, at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm. Their equal integration and appearance as an AA\u2032BB\u2032 pattern with typical ortho coupling (J\u22487\u20139 Hz expected) indicate two sets of equivalent protons on a benzene ring bearing two substituents in para positions. This symmetry rules out meta or ortho substitution patterns. Together, these data point to a para-substituted benzoic acid.; answer - Singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H): carboxylic acid proton; doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H): two sets of ortho-coupled aromatic protons on a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 in a ~3:1 ratio, indicating one chlorine atom. The IR spectrum exhibits a broad 3500\u20132700 cm\u207b\u00b9 stretch and a sharp 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 band, diagnostic of a carboxylic acid (\u2013COOH). The \u00b9H NMR displays a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) corresponding to the acidic proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) with equal integration and ortho coupling, consistent with an AA\u2032BB\u2032 pattern on a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Combining these data, the unknown is a para-substituted benzoic acid bearing one chlorine atom, i.e. 4-chlorobenzoic acid.; answer - 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The molecular ion at m/z 156 with a significant M+2 peak (~32%) indicates a single chlorine atom (3:1 Cl isotopic pattern).
