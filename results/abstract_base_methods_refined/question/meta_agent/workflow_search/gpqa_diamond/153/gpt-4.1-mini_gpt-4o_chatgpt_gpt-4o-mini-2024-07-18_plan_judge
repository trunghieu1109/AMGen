Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data interpretation indicates the presence of a chlorine atom due to the mass spectrum peaks at m/z = 156 and 158 with a 3:1 ratio. The IR spectrum suggests a carboxylic acid group with a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, indicating aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the options, 4-chlorobenzoic acid matches all these features: it has the correct molecular formula, a carboxylic acid group, and the NMR data matches a para-substituted benzene ring. The other options do not fit as well. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
