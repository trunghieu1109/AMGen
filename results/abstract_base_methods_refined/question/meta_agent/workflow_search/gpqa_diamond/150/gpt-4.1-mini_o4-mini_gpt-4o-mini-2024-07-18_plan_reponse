An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0).

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The given state vector has components (\u22121,2,1). Its norm is \u221a[ (\u22121)\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 ] = \u221a6. To normalize, divide each component by \u221a6, yielding the normalized column matrix suitable for quantum probability calculations.; answer - The normalized state vector is (\u22121/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6)\u1d40.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The observable operator P is defined by its matrix elements row by row. We simply place each given tuple into the corresponding row of a 3\u00d73 matrix. Since the first row is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the second is (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and the third is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the full matrix is constructed by listing these rows in order.; answer - P = [[0, 1/\u221a2, 0], [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the eigenvalues \u03bb we solve det(P\u2013\u03bbI)=0. For P=[[0,1/\u221a2,0],[1/\u221a2,0,1/\u221a2],[0,1/\u221a2,0]] the characteristic polynomial is \u2212\u03bb^3+\u03bb=\u2212\u03bb(\u03bb^2\u22121)=0, giving \u03bb=0,\u00b11. Next we find the null\u2010space of P corresponding to \u03bb=0: \n\n(P\u22120\u00b7I)[x,y,z]^T=0 \u21d2\n(1) (1/\u221a2)y=0 \u21d2 y=0\n(2) (1/\u221a2)x+(1/\u221a2)z=0 \u21d2 x+z=0 \u21d2 z=\u2212x\n(3) (1/\u221a2)y=0 \u21d2 y=0\n\nHence the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,0,\u22121). A common normalized choice is (1/\u221a2,0,\u22121/\u221a2).; answer - Eigenvalues: \u03bb=+1, \u03bb=0, \u03bb=\u22121. The eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any scalar multiple of (1,0,\u22121), e.g. normalized to (1/\u221a2, 0, \u22121/\u221a2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 as (1,0,\u22121). To normalize, compute its norm: ||v||=\u221a(1^2+0^2+(\u22121)^2)=\u221a2. Divide each component by \u221a2 to get the unit vector.; answer - The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is (1/\u221a2, 0, \u22121/\u221a2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We first normalize the given state vector |\u03c8\u27e9=(\u22121,2,1)\u1d40. Its norm is \u221a[(-1)\u00b2+2\u00b2+1\u00b2]=\u221a6, so |\u03c8\u27e9\u2099=(\u22121/\u221a6,2/\u221a6,1/\u221a6)\u1d40. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1,0,\u22121)\u1d40, which normalized is |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9=(1/\u221a2,0,\u22121/\u221a2)\u1d40. The inner product \u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(\u22121/\u221a6) + 0\u00b7(2/\u221a6) + (\u22121/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) = \u22121/(\u221a2\u221a6) \u2212 1/(\u221a2\u221a6) = \u22122/\u221a12 = \u22122/(2\u221a3) = \u22121/\u221a3. Hence the projection amplitude onto the zero\u2010eigenvalue subspace is \u22121/\u221a3.; answer - -1/\u221a3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The projection amplitude onto the zero-eigenvalue subspace from Sub-task 5 is \u20131/\u221a3. The probability is the squared magnitude of this amplitude: |\u20131/\u221a3|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a3)\u00b2 = 1/3.; answer - 1/3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The previously calculated probability for measuring the observable to yield 0 is 1/3. Among the provided options: A) 1/3, B) 2/3, C) \u221a(2/3), D) 1, the value 1/3 matches option A. Therefore, the correct choice is A.; answer - A"
