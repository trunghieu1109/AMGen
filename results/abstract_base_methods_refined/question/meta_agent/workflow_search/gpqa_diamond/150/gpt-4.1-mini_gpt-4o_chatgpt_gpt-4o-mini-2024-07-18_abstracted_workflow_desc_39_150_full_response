The norm of a vector (a, b, c) is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of its components: √(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). For the vector (-1, 2, 1), the norm is √((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = √(1 + 4 + 1) = √6. To normalize the vector, we divide each component by this norm: (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6).

The first row of P is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Therefore, the matrix P is constructed by placing these elements in the corresponding positions in a 3x3 matrix.; answer - The observable operator P is a 3x3 matrix given by: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues. The matrix P is given as:\n\nP = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].\n\nFirst, we set up the matrix P - λI:\n\nP - λI = [[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]].\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is calculated as:\n\ndet(P - λI) = -λ * (λ^2 - 1/2) + 1/sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2) * λ) = -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.\n\nSetting this equal to 0 gives the characteristic equation:\n\n-λ^3 + λ = 0.\n\nFactoring out λ, we get:\n\nλ(-λ^2 + 1) = 0.\n\nThis gives the eigenvalues as λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. For λ = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which is:\n\n[[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0].\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n\n1/sqrt(2) * y = 0,\n1/sqrt(2) * x + 1/sqrt(2) * z = 0,\n1/sqrt(2) * y = 0.\n\nFrom the first and third equations, y = 0.

To normalize this eigenvector, we need to ensure it has a unit norm. The norm of a vector [a, b, c] is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). For the vector [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], the norm is sqrt((1/sqrt(2))^2 + 0^2 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(1/2 + 0 + 1/2) = sqrt(1) = 1. Since the norm is already 1, the vector is already normalized.

The dot product is calculated as follows: (-1/√6) * (1/√2) + (2/√6) * 0 + (1/√6) * (-1/√2). Simplifying each term, we have: (-1/√6) * (1/√2) = -1/(√12), (2/√6) * 0 = 0, and (1/√6) * (-1/√2) = -1/(√12). Adding these terms gives us -1/(√12) + 0 - 1/(√12) = -2/(√12). Simplifying -2/(√12), we note that √12 = √(4 * 3) = 2√3, so -2/(√12) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3.
