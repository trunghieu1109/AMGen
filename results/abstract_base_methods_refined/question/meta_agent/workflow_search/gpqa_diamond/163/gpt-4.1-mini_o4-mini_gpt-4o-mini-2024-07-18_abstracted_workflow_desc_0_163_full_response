It also ignores projection factors (sin\u2009i), the mass ratio in determining the individual semi‐major axes, and potential errors from third‐light contamination or uncertain distance.; answer: A fully correct derivation uses: a₁=(K₁P)/(2π), a₂=(K₂P)/(2π), a=a₁+a₂, and M₁+M₂=(4π²a³)/(GP²), with each K measured in the system’s rest frame, then multiplies by sin³i to account for inclination.
