            "Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.",

It says in system_1 the two stars display amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and in system_2 the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

Label star 1 with amplitude K1 and star 2 with K2, then m1/m2 = K2/K1. For system_1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s, so m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5.
