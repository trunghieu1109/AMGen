Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the number of detectable stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we analyze the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) values for each star against the threshold of S/N â‰¥ 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The analysis shows that Canopus has an S/N of >100 (detectable), Polaris has an S/N of 50-70 (detectable), the star at 10 pc has an S/N of ~10 (detectable), the star at 200 pc has an S/N of <1 (not detectable), the star at 5 pc has an S/N of ~20 (detectable), and the star at 50 pc has an S/N of ~5 (not detectable). Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc, totaling 4 detectable stars. Thus, the correct answer is 4 detectable stars, which corresponds to choice '4'.
