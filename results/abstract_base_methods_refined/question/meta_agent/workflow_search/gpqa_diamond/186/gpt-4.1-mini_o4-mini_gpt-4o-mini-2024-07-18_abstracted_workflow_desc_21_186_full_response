I then explain how each influences the achieved S/N per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure, such as photon flux scaling with aperture and throughput, noise sources (shot noise, read noise, dark current, sky background), resolution and pixel binning trade-offs, and environmental factors.; answer: ESPRESSO on an 8 m VLT: 1) Telescope aperture: 8.2 m diameter (effective collecting area ~50 m²)—larger area yields higher photon rates. 2) Total throughput: ≈10–15% (including telescope optics, fibers, spectrograph optics, detector)—directly scales detected photons. 3) Wavelength coverage: 380–788 nm—photon flux and detector QE vary across this range. 4) Spectral resolution modes: R≈70,000 (single UT) or R≈140,000 (four-UT combined) determines the amount of light per spectral resolution element; higher R spreads photons over more pixels, lowering S/N per pixel. 5) Pixel sampling and binning: ≈2 pixels per resolution element; binning (spectral or spatial) increases S/N by √N_bins but reduces resolution. 6) Detector characteristics: CCD quantum efficiency up to ~90% in V-band, read noise ≈0.7 e–/pixel, dark current ≈1 e–/hr/pixel—read noise dominates at low flux, dark current negligible for 1 hr. 7) Sky background: dark-sky continuum ~21 mag/arcsec² in V—adds photon noise; fiber entrance projects ~1 arcsec². 8) Seeing and airmass: typical Paranal seeing ~0.8″ and airmass ~1.2—impact slit losses and atmospheric extinction (~0.1 mag). 9) Exposure time: 1 hr exposure accumulates signal S ∝ T_exp × photon rate; noise N = √(S + N_sky + N_dark + N_read²). Combining these, for a V=16 star at Paranal, S/N≈10 per binned pixel in 1 hr corresponds to total system throughput and noise budget above.

Key factors include collecting area, overall throughput (telescope\u2009+\u2009instrument), spectral resolution (dictating pixel width in Å and hence photon count per pixel), detector characteristics (quantum efficiency, read noise, dark current), sky background, slit/fibre feeding losses under typical Paranal seeing, and binning strategy. I also considered the blaze function and fibre injection efficiency, plus the spectral energy distribution of a target of given magnitude.

Canopus and Polaris are well‐studied bright stars with catalogued V magnitudes in SIMBAD, Hipparcos, etc., so adopting these values does not introduce unsupported assumptions.

Canopus and Polaris lack parameters in the original question, so we must either adopt well-known catalog values or label them indeterminate.  Since high-precision S/N modeling relies on published magnitudes, it’s appropriate to use standard apparent V magnitudes from the Hipparcos/Tycho catalogs.  Canopus is one of the brightest stars (V≈–0.72) and Polaris is a classical Cepheid with V≈1.98.  These values enable quantitative S/N predictions; if one wished to avoid any assumption one would flag both as “indeterminate,” but it’s more useful to supply the published magnitudes.; answer: Reference apparent magnitudes for known bright stars:\n\nStar      | Apparent V magnitude | Source\nCanopus   | –0.72                | Hipparcos (ESA, 1997)\nPolaris   |  1.98                | Hipparcos (ESA, 1997)\n\nThese published V magnitudes allow quantitative S/N calculations with ESPRESSO.
