The S/N ratio is influenced by the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, and the instrument's sensitivity. Brighter stars (lower apparent magnitudes) yield higher S/N ratios. Based on typical values for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we estimate the S/N ratios as follows: 1) Canopus (apparent magnitude ~-5.5) would have a very high S/N, likely above 100; 2) Polaris (apparent magnitude ~-3.6) would have a high S/N, likely around 50-70; 3) The star at 10 pc (apparent magnitude 15) would have a low S/N, likely around 10; 4) The star at 200 pc (apparent magnitude 21.505) would have a very low S/N, likely below 1; 5) The star at 5 pc (apparent magnitude 13.495) would have a moderate S/N, likely around 20; 6) The star at 50 pc (apparent magnitude 18.495) would have a low S/N, likely around 5. Therefore, the expected S/N ratios for the stars are: Canopus: >100, Polaris: 50-70, Star at 10 pc: ~10, Star at 200 pc: <1, Star at 5 pc: ~20, Star at 50 pc: ~5.; answer: Canopus: >100, Polaris: 50-70, Star at 10 pc: ~10, Star at 200 pc: <1, Star at 5 pc: ~20, Star at 50 pc: ~5.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Z1Vz, round 0, determining detectability and counting stars, thinking: To determine the detectability of each star, we compare the estimated S/N values against the threshold of S/N ≥ 10.

The analysis shows that Canopus has an S/N of >100 (detectable), Polaris has an S/N of 50-70 (detectable), the star at 10 pc has an S/N of ~10 (detectable), the star at 200 pc has an S/N of <1 (not detectable), the star at 5 pc has an S/N of ~20 (detectable), and the star at 50 pc has an S/N of ~5 (not detectable). Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc, totaling 4 detectable stars.
