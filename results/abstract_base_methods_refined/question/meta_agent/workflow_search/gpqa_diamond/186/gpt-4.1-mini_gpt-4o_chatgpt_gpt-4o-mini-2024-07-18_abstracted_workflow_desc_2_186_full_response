A star is detectable if its S/N is at least 10. From the calculations: 1) Canopus has a very high S/N, well above 10, so it is detectable. 2) Polaris also has a very high S/N, making it detectable. 3) Star c has an S/N of 15.85, which is above 10, so it is detectable. 4) Star d has an S/N of 0.63, which is below 10, so it is not detectable. 5) Star e has an S/N of 100.2, which is well above 10, so it is detectable. 6) Star f has an S/N of 1.00, which is below 10, so it is not detectable.

Canopus and Polaris are very bright stars, and it is consistent with common sense that they are detectable with a high S/N ratio using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. The calculations for the other stars, based on their absolute magnitudes and distances, also seem reasonable. Star c, with an S/N of 15.85, is detectable, while Star d, with an S/N of 0.63, is not, which makes sense given the distance and magnitude.

Canopus and Polaris are indeed very bright stars and should be detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph. The calculations for the other stars, based on their absolute magnitudes and distances, also seem reasonable.
