Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The combined product mixture contains three stereoisomers: one achiral meso diol and two enantiomers of the threo diol. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomeric pair will be resolved into two separate peaks, whereas the achiral meso diol does not interact enantioselectively and elutes as a single peak. Assuming ideal chromatographic resolution, this yields a total of three distinct peaks.

Answer:3 peaks
Extracted answer: 3 peaks
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: Reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the achiral meso diol, while reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. On a standard (achiral) column, the two enantiomers coelute as one peak and the meso diol elutes separately, giving 2 peaks. On a chiral column, the racemic enantiomers are resolved into two distinct peaks and the meso diol remains as one peak, giving 3 peaks. This matches choice C.
