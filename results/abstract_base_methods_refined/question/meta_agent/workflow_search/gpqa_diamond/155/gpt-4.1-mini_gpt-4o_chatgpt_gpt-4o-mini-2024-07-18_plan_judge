Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Based on the sub-task analyses, we have determined that on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, the two enantiomers from Reaction 1 co-elute as a single peak, and the meso compound from Reaction 2 appears as a separate peak, resulting in 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomers are resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso compound appears as a single peak, resulting in 3 peaks. Therefore, the correct choice that matches these observations is '2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC'.
