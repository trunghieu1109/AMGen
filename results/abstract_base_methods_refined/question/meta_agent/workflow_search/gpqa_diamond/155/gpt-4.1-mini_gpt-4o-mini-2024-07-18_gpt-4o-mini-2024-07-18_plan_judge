Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the analysis of the combined product mixture from both reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, we have determined that there are four distinct stereoisomers produced. In a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, these four stereoisomers will be separated based on their structural differences, leading to the observation of four distinct peaks. In contrast, when the same mixture is analyzed on a chiral HPLC column, the same four stereoisomers will also produce four distinct peaks due to their unique interactions with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, both the standard and chiral HPLC analyses will yield four peaks each. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer to the multiple-choice question is that there are 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Answer:4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
