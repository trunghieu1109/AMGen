Subsequent acid‐catalyzed ring opening proceeds with anti addition of water, yielding the trans‐1,2‐diol. Because the original E‐oct‐4‐ene is symmetrical, both epoxidation and hydrolysis products remain achiral by virtue of an internal mirror plane. Thus Reaction 1 gives one product: the meso-4,5-octanediol.; answer - Reaction 1 yields exclusively the meso trans-4,5-octanediol (the achiral vicinal diol).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The reaction of a Z-alkene with a peracid proceeds by concerted syn addition of O across the double bond. Starting from (Z)-oct-4-ene, both substituents (n-propyl groups) lie on the same side of the C4–C5 bond. Syn epoxidation therefore gives a cis-disubstituted epoxide where the two propyl groups are cis. Because these substituents are identical groups, the epoxide is internally symmetric (a meso compound) and thus achiral. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide is protonated and then opened by water from the backside of either carbon; but because the epoxide is meso and symmetric, attack from either face leads to the same single product: the trans-1,2-diol (OH groups anti), which, with identical propyl substituents, is again a meso (achiral) diol.

There are no enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent aX1x, combining products and enumerating stereoisomers, thinking: Sub-task 1 (E‐alkene): Epoxidation of (E)‐oct‐4‐ene gives a trans‐disubstituted epoxide that is meso (internal mirror plane). Acid‐catalyzed ring opening by anti attack yields trans-1,2-diol, which—because the two n-propyl substituents are identical—is meso (achiral) 4,5-octanediol.\n\nSub-task 2 (Z‐alkene): Epoxidation of (Z)‐oct‐4‐ene gives a cis‐disubstituted epoxide (no internal mirror plane), so a racemic pair of epoxides. Ring opening by anti attack converts each enantiomer into a cis-1,2-diol. These cis diols are enantiomeric (the two hydroxylated stereocenters have the same relative configuration) and give an (R,R)/(S,S) pair of 4,5-octanediols.\n\nTherefore, when you combine the products of Reactions 1 and 2, you have three distinct stereoisomers:\n1) meso-trans-4,5-octanediol (achiral)\n2) (R,R)-cis-4,5-octanediol\n3) (S,S)-cis-4,5-octanediol\n\nThe meso diol is a diastereomer to each of the cis enantiomers, which in turn are enantiomeric to one another.; answer: Three stereoisomers: one meso (trans-4,5-octanediol, achiral) plus a pair of enantiomers [(R,R)-cis-4,5-octanediol and (S,S)-cis-4,5-octanediol].\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent DySA, combining products and enumerating stereoisomers, thinking: First, we must reconsider the stereochemical courses of each reaction.\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical trans alkene. Epoxidation with mCPBA gives a trans-epoxide, which is chiral and therefore formed as a racemic pair of enantiomers. Under acid‐catalyzed anti ring opening, a cis-1,2-diol is produced from each epoxide enantiomer. A cis vicinal diol on a symmetrical backbone is meso (2R,3S), so each enantiomeric epoxide converges to the same meso-diol. Thus Reaction 1 yields a single achiral meso-4,5-octanediol.\n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical cis alkene. Epoxidation gives a cis-epoxide, which is meso (internally symmetric) and achiral. Anti opening of that meso epoxide produces a trans-1,2-diol. On a symmetrical backbone, a trans vicinal diol is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (2R,3R and 2S,3S). Because the starting epoxide was meso, attack on either face of either carbon still generates both enantiomers in a 1:1 ratio. Thus Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of trans-4,5-octanediol.\n\nWhen the two reaction mixtures are combined, we have three distinct stereoisomers:\n  1) the meso-4,5-octanediol (from Reaction 1),\n  2) the (R,R)-4,5-octanediol,\n  3) the (S,S)-4,5-octanediol.\n\nThe two (R,R)/(S,S) forms are enantiomers of each other; the meso form is achiral and is a diastereomer to each enantiomer.\n; answer: The mixture contains three stereoisomers: the achiral meso-4,5-octanediol and the enantiomeric pair (R,R)-4,5-octanediol and (S,S)-4,5-octanediol. The R,R and S,S forms are enantiomers of each other; the meso form is their diastereomer.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Cquk, predicting chromatographic behavior on achiral HPLC, thinking: Since both the E- and Z-alkene give the identical meso trans-4,5-octanediol and no other stereoisomers are present, there is only one compound in the mixture. A standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column will therefore show just one chromatographic peak (ignoring any trace impurities or baseline noise).; answer: One peak\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent Yq34, providing feedback, thinking: The original prediction of a single peak on an achiral reverse-phase column is incomplete because it assumes only the meso diol is present. In reality, the Z-alkene gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols that co-elute as one peak on an achiral column, while the meso diol elutes separately. Thus, under ideal resolution you observe two distinct peaks: one for the meso diol and one for the racemic diol pair. In practice, limited chromatographic resolution can cause peak broadening or partial overlap, potentially making baseline separation challenging.; answer: Two peaks\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Cquk, refining chromatographic prediction on achiral HPLC, thinking: Anti-dihydroxylation of the E-alkene (trans) gives the meso diol, while anti addition to the Z-alkene (cis) gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. On an achiral reverse-phase column, the two enantiomers coelute as one peak, and the meso diol elutes separately.

A chiral HPLC column separates enantiomers but will not resolve an achiral compound into multiple peaks. Therefore, even under ideal resolution conditions (and considering practical limitations), only a single chromatographic peak will be observed.; answer: One peak\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent gYss, round 0, predicting chromatographic behavior on chiral HPLC, thinking: Both (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene yield only the meso trans-4,5-octanediol, an achiral compound. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomeric resolution only applies to chiral analytes; meso diol has no enantiomeric partner and thus cannot be resolved into multiple peaks. Even under ideal theoretical resolution, there is only one chemical species present. Practically, there are no diastereomers or enantiomers to separate, so only a single chromatographic signal will be observed.; answer: One peak\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent jXau, round 0, predicting chromatographic behavior on chiral HPLC, thinking: Both (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene give only the same meso trans-4,5-octanediol, which is achiral. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomeric separation relies on differential interactions of enantiomers with the chiral stationary phase. Since a meso compound is superimposable on its mirror image, there are no enantiomers to resolve. Thus even under ideal resolution conditions, only a single peak will be observed. Practical limitations (e.g., slight peak tailing or baseline noise) cannot generate additional true peaks for a single achiral compound.; answer: 1 peak.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent jYsl, round 0, predicting chromatographic behavior on chiral HPLC, thinking: Both the E- and Z-alkene routes converge on the identical meso trans-4,5-octanediol—an achiral compound with no enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners. On a chiral stationary phase only chiral analytes are resolved into separate enantiomeric peaks; an achiral molecule yields a single band. Even accounting for real-world factors (peak tailing, slight non-idealities), there are no additional stereoisomers to separate, so only one distinct peak appears.; answer: 1 peak\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, calculating final chromatographic prediction on chiral HPLC, thinking: Both (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene give the same meso trans-4,5-octanediol—a single achiral compound with no enantiomeric counterpart.
