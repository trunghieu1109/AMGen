        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The epoxidation of an alkene by mCPBA is a concerted syn addition, giving a single enantiomeric epoxide if the alkene is chiral\u2014but (E)-oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the epoxide is actually a meso epoxide. Under acidic aqueous workup the epoxide ring opens by anti attack of water at the more substituted carbon, yielding an anti (trans) diol. For a symmetric (E)-internal alkene, trans-dihydroxylation thus gives a single meso diastereomer. In this case the product is meso-4,5-octanediol (with opposite configurations at C4 and C5, 4R,5S or equivalently 4S,5R but overall achiral).; answer - meso-4,5-octanediol (single meso diastereomer, 4R,5S)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Z-alkene places the ethyl and propyl substituents cis. mCPBA epoxidizes via a concerted syn addition to give a cis\u2010substituted epoxide, which is chiral at both epoxide carbons; because the approach of the peracid can occur on either face with equal probability, a racemic pair of epoxides is formed. Under acidic aqueous conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring opening by anti attack of water at the more substituted carbon, giving an anti (trans) diol. Since the starting epoxide was racemic, the diol product is also racemic. The two enantiomers are threo\u20104,5\u2010octanediol, i.e. (2R,3S)\u20104,5\u2010octanediol and (2S,3R)\u20104,5\u2010octanediol.; answer - Racemic anti\u20104,5\u2010octanediol (threo diol), i.e. (2R,3S) and (2S,3R) 4,5\u2010octanediol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Reaction 1 yields a single achiral meso-4,5-octanediol. Reaction 2 yields a racemic pair of the anti (threo) diol, i.e. two enantiomers. Combining them gives one meso diastereomer plus its two enantiomers, for a total of three stereoisomers.; answer - 3 stereoisomers: meso-4,5-octanediol (achiral) and the two enantiomers of threo-4,5-octanediol\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - On an achiral reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers coelute and appear as one peak, while diastereomers separate if resolution is ideal. Our mixture contains the achiral meso diol (one stereoisomer) and the racemic threo diol (two enantiomers). The racemic pair coelutes as a single peak, and the meso diol gives a separate peak. Therefore, assuming perfect resolution of diastereomers, we expect two distinct peaks.; answer - 2 peaks\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The combined product mixture contains three stereoisomers: one achiral meso diol and two enantiomers of the threo diol. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomeric pair will be resolved into two separate peaks, whereas the achiral meso diol does not interact enantioselectively and elutes as a single peak.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The epoxidation of a symmetrical E\u2010alkene with mCPBA is a concerted syn addition that preserves the molecule\u2019s mirror plane, giving a single meso epoxide intermediate. Subsequent acid\u2010catalyzed ring opening proceeds with anti addition of water, yielding the trans\u20101,2\u2010diol. Because the original E\u2010oct\u20104\u2010ene is symmetrical, both epoxidation and hydrolysis products remain achiral by virtue of an internal mirror plane. Thus Reaction 1 gives one product: the meso-4,5-octanediol.; answer - Reaction 1 yields exclusively the meso trans-4,5-octanediol (the achiral vicinal diol).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The reaction of a Z-alkene with a peracid proceeds by concerted syn addition of O across the double bond. Starting from (Z)-oct-4-ene, both substituents (n-propyl groups) lie on the same side of the C4\u2013C5 bond. Syn epoxidation therefore gives a cis-disubstituted epoxide where the two propyl groups are cis. Because these substituents are identical groups, the epoxide is internally symmetric (a meso compound) and thus achiral. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide is protonated and then opened by water from the backside of either carbon; but because the epoxide is meso and symmetric, attack from either face leads to the same single product: the trans-1,2-diol (OH groups anti), which, with identical propyl substituents, is again a meso (achiral) diol. No enantiomers are formed at any stage.; answer - Reaction 2 gives a single meso epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane) and upon acid-catalyzed ring opening yields a single meso trans-4,5-octanediol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Both the (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene give the same meso vicinal diol.  In Reaction 1, the concerted syn epoxidation of the symmetric E-alkene followed by anti ring opening gives a single meso (achiral) trans-4,5-octanediol.  In Reaction 2, syn epoxidation of the Z-alkene also yields a symmetric meso epoxide, and its acid-catalyzed opening again gives the identical meso trans-4,5-octanediol.  There are no enantiomers or other diastereomers formed\u2014both reactions produce the same single achiral diol.; answer - Only one stereoisomer is present: meso trans-4,5-octanediol (achiral). There are no enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Anti-dihydroxylation of the E-alkene (trans) gives the meso diol, while anti addition to the Z-alkene (cis) gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. On an achiral reverse-phase column, the two enantiomers coelute as one peak, and the meso diol elutes separately. Thus, ideally you see two chromatographic peaks: one from the meso diol and one from the coeluting racemate. In practice, finite column efficiency can cause peak broadening or partial overlap, potentially making baseline resolution of these two peaks challenging.; answer - Two peaks (one for meso diol; one for the coeluting racemic pair)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Both (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene give the same meso trans-4,5-octanediol\u2014a single achiral compound with no enantiomeric counterpart. A chiral HPLC column separates enantiomers based on differential interactions with the chiral stationary phase. Since a meso diol is superimposable on its mirror image and has no enantiomer, there are no two species to resolve. Even under ideal chromatographic conditions and ignoring minor practical artifacts (e.g., tailing), only one true peak will appear.; answer - One peak\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the achiral meso diol, while reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. On a standard (achiral) column, the two enantiomers coelute as one peak and the meso diol elutes separately, giving 2 peaks. On a chiral column, the racemic enantiomers are resolved into two distinct peaks and the meso diol remains as one peak, giving 3 peaks.
