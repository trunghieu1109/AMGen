The ratio of the populations of the two energy levels is given by N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT). In this case, we can assume that the degeneracies g1 and g2 are equal, which simplifies our equation to N1/N2 = exp(-ΔE/kT).

The ratio of populations of two energy levels, n1 and n2, can be expressed as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies of the energy levels, ΔE is the energy difference between them, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. In this case, since the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, we can set up the equation using the ratio of populations. The effective temperatures of the two stars must relate to the energy difference and the excitation ratios through the Boltzmann factor. Therefore, the relevant physical principle is the Boltzmann distribution that connects temperature to the excitation levels of atoms in LTE.; answer: The Boltzmann distribution formula for population ratios of energy levels under LTE is given by n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent eOCo, recalling Boltzmann distribution, thinking: The Boltzmann distribution describes how the populations of energy levels in a system at thermal equilibrium are related to the temperature of the system.

For two stars with iron atoms, if the population in one star is twice that of the other, we can set up the equation ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT). In this case, we can assume that the degeneracies (g1 and g2) are equal, simplifying our ratio to N1/N2 = exp(-ΔE/kT). Since we know that the excitation levels of iron in star_1 are twice that in star_2, we can write this as N1/N2 = 2. Thus, we have: 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT1) / exp(-ΔE/kT2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us ln(2) = (-ΔE/kT1) + (ΔE/kT2). Rearranging this leads us to express the ratio in terms of T1 and T2, yielding the equation: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Given that we are comparing star_1 and star_2, we can express this ratio in terms of their effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 and the energy difference ΔE.
