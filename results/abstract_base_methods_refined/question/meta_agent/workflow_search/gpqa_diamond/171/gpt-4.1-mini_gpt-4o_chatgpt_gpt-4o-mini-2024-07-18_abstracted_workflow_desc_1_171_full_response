The option that most closely resembles the derived expression is choice 4: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)].

The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) implies that the populations of atomic energy levels follow the Boltzmann distribution. The excitation ratio of 2:1 suggests that the temperature difference between the stars affects the population of these energy levels. The Boltzmann factor, which describes the ratio of populations of two energy levels, is given by exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

If n_1 and n_2 are the populations of the excited state in star_1 and star_2 respectively, and ΔE is the energy difference, then n_1/n_2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). This simplifies to n_1/n_2 = exp(ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Since it is given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, we have n_1/n_2 = 2.

To derive the relationship involving ln(2), we take the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation. The natural logarithm of 2 is ln(2), and the natural logarithm of the exponential function exp(x) is simply x. Therefore, taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This equation relates the natural logarithm of the excitation ratio (ln(2)) to the energy difference ΔE, the Boltzmann constant k, and the inverse temperatures of the two stars (1/T_2 and 1/T_1).

According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the expression exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. This principle is applicable here because the problem involves the excitation ratio of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, and it is assumed that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

If n_1 and n_2 are the populations of the excited state in star_1 and star_2 respectively, and ΔE is the energy difference, then n_1/n_2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). This simplifies to n_1/n_2 = exp(ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Since it is given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, we have n_1/n_2 = 2.
