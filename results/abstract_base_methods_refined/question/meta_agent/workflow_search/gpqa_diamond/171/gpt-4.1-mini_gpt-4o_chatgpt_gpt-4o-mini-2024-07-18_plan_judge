Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The derived expression from the sub-tasks is ln(2) = Î”E/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This can be rearranged to ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) by using the identity 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Comparing this with the multiple-choice options, option 4, which is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)], matches the rearranged expression exactly. The other options do not match the derived expression: option 1 involves a ratio of temperatures, option 2 involves squaring the product of temperatures, and option 3 involves the sum of temperatures. Therefore, option 4 is the correct representation of the relationship between T1 and T2.
