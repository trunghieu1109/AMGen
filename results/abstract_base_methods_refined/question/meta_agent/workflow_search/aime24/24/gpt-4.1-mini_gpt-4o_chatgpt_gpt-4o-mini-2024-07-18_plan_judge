Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_24
proposed answer: The problem requires us to find the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) and express it as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. From the related sub-task answers, we know that \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{19}{24} \). The absolute value of this is \( \left| -\frac{19}{24} \right| = \frac{19}{24} \). The fraction \( \frac{19}{24} \) is already in its simplest form, with 19 and 24 being relatively prime. Therefore, \( m = 19 \) and \( n = 24 \). The sum \( m + n = 19 + 24 = 43 \). This confirms that the answer is 43.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, the fraction obtained was 25/8, which is already in its simplest form since 25 and 8 are relatively prime. The sum m + n, where m = 25 and n = 8, is calculated as 25 + 8 = 33. Therefore, the final integer answer to be returned is 33.
