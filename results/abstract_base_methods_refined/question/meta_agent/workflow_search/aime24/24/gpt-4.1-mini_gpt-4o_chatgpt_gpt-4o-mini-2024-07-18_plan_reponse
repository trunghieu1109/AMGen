Each original logarithmic equation has been rewritten using the properties of logarithms to form linear equations. Specifically, the equation log_2(x/(yz)) = 1/2 becomes a - b - c = 1/2. Similarly, log_2(y/(xz)) = 1/3 becomes b - a - c = 1/3, and log_2(z/(xy)) = 1/4 becomes c - a - b = 1/4. These transformations are consistent with the properties of logarithms where log_2(x/y) = log_2 x - log_2 y. Consequently, the system is expressed as linear equations in terms of a, b, and c.; answer - The system of linear equations is: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have the system of linear equations: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4. We can solve this system by adding all three equations together. Adding them gives: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. The left side simplifies to -a - b - c, and the right side is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12. So we have -a - b - c = 13/12. Now, let's solve for a, b, and c individually. From the first equation, a = b + c + 1/2. From the second equation, b = a + c + 1/3. From the third equation, c = a + b + 1/4. Substitute a = b + c + 1/2 into the second equation: b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3, which simplifies to 0 = 2c + 1/2 + 1/3. Solving for c, we get c = -5/12. Substitute c = -5/12 into a = b + c + 1/2: a = b - 5/12 + 1/2 = b + 1/12. Substitute c = -5/12 into b = a + c + 1/3: b = a - 5/12 + 1/3 = a - 1/12. Now we have a = b + 1/12 and b = a - 1/12. Solving these two equations, we find a = 1/24 and b = -1/24. Therefore, a = 1/24, b = -1/24, c = -5/12.; answer - a = 1/24, b = -1/24, c = -5/12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We are given that a = log_2 x = 1/24, b = log_2 y = -1/24, and c = log_2 z = -5/12. We need to compute log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2). Using the properties of logarithms, we have log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log_2 x + 3 log_2 y + 2 log_2 z. Substituting the values of a, b, and c, we get 4a + 3b + 2c = 4(1/24) + 3(-1/24) + 2(-5/12). Simplifying, 4(1/24) = 1/6, 3(-1/24) = -1/8, and 2(-5/12) = -5/6. Adding these, we have 1/6 - 1/8 - 5/6. Converting to a common denominator, 1/6 = 4/24, -1/8 = -3/24, and -5/6 = -20/24. Adding these, we get 4/24 - 3/24 - 20/24 = -19/24. Therefore, log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -19/24. The problem asks for the absolute value, so we have |-19/24| = 19/24. The fraction 19/24 is already in simplest form, so m = 19 and n = 24.

First, we check if these satisfy the sum equation a + b + c = -(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). We compute 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12, so a + b + c should be -13/12. Now, calculate a + b + c: a = -7/24, b = -3/8 = -9/24, c = -5/12 = -10/24. Therefore, a + b + c = -7/24 - 9/24 - 10/24 = -26/24 = -13/12, which matches. Next, we verify each original linear equation: 1) a - b - c = -7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = 12/24 = 1/2, which is correct. 2) b - a - c = -9/24 + 7/24 + 10/24 = 8/24 = 1/3, which is correct. 3) c - a - b = -10/24 + 7/24 + 9/24 = 6/24 = 1/4, which is correct. All equations are satisfied. However, note that a, b, c are negative, which is consistent with the logarithmic expressions involving ratios of positive numbers. Thus, the solution is consistent.; answer - The values of a, b, and c satisfy the sum equation from Sub-task 3a and all original linear equations, ensuring consistency and positivity constraints.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have the values a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12, which correspond to log_2(x), log_2(y), and log_2(z) respectively. We need to calculate log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2). Using the properties of logarithms, we have: log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4*log_2(x) + 3*log_2(y) + 2*log_2(z). Substituting the values of a, b, and c, we get: 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Simplifying each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, and 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now, we find a common denominator to add these fractions. The common denominator for 6, 8, and 6 is 24. Converting each term: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Adding these: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Therefore, log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -75/24. The absolute value is |-75/24| = 75/24. Simplifying 75/24, we get 75/24 = 25/8. Thus, the value of |log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8, where m = 25 and n = 8.
