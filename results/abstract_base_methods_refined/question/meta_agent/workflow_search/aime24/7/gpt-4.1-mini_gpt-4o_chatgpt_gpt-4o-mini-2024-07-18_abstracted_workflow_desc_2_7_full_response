To express y as a function of x, we start with the first equation: 10 log x = x log y, which gives log y = (10 log x) / x. From the second equation: 10 log y = 4y log x, substitute log y from the first equation: 10((10 log x) / x) = 4y log x. Simplifying, we get y = (25/x) * x^(1/4) = 25^(1/4) * x^(3/4). Thus, y = x^(3/4) * 25^(1/4). Substitute y into the first equation: x^10 = (x^(3/4) * 25^(1/4))^x. Simplifying, we have x^10 = x^(3x/4) * 25^(x/4). Taking log of both sides: 10 log x = (3x/4) log x + (x/4) log 25. Rearranging gives: 10 log x - (3x/4) log x = (x/4) log 25. Simplifying: (40 log x - 3x log x) = x log 25, or (x + 10) log x = x log 25. Switching to natural logarithms, this becomes (x + 10) ln x = x ln 25, or (x + 10) ln x - x ln 25 = 0. This is the single-variable equation f(x) = (x + 10) ln x - x ln 25 = 0. To solve for x, we can use numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method, or graphing to find where f(x) = 0.

From the second equation: 10 log y = 4y log x, substitute log y from the first equation: 10((10 log x) / x) = 4y log x. Simplifying, we get y = (25/x) * x^(1/4) = 25^(1/4) * x^(3/4). Thus, y = x^(3/4) * 25^(1/4). Substitute y into the first equation: x^10 = (x^(3/4) * 25^(1/4))^x. Simplifying, we have x^10 = x^(3x/4) * 25^(x/4). Taking log of both sides: 10 log x = (3x/4) log x + (x/4) log 25. Rearranging gives: 10 log x - (3x/4) log x = (x/4) log 25.

We can express log y in terms of log x from the first equation: log y = (10 log x) / x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 10((10 log x) / x) = 4y log x. Simplifying gives y = (25 log x) / x. Since y > 1, we have (25 log x) / x > 1, which implies log x > x / 25. Substituting y = (25 log x) / x back into the equation x^{10} = y^x, we get x^{10} = ((25 log x) / x)^x. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives 10 ln x = x ln((25 log x) / x) = x(ln(25 log x) - ln x). Simplifying, we have 10 ln x = x ln(25 log x) - x ln x.

We can express log y in terms of log x from the first equation: log y = (10 log x) / x. Substitute this into the second equation: 10 (10 log x / x) = 4y log x. Simplifying gives 100 log x = 4xy log x. Cancel log x (assuming log x is not zero, which is valid since x > 1): 100 = 4xy. Therefore, xy = 25. From the first equation: x log y = 10 log x, log y = (10 log x) / x. Substitute y = 25/x into log y = (10 log x) / x gives log(25/x) = (10 log x) / x. Use the identity log(25/x) = log 25 - log x: log 25 - log x = (10 log x) / x. Rearrange to get log 25 = log x + (10 log x) / x. Multiply through by x: x log 25 = x log x + 10 log x. This is x log 25 = (x + 10) log x. Converting to natural logarithms: x ln 25 = (x + 10) ln x. Rearrange to get the single-variable equation: (x + 10) ln x - x ln 25 = 0.

We can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method, which iteratively refines guesses for the root. The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = (1 + ln x + 10/x) - ln 25. Using an initial guess greater than 1, we apply the Newton-Raphson iteration: x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n). After several iterations, we find a convergent value of x. Once we have x, we can compute y using y = 25 / x. We verify that both x and y are greater than 1.
