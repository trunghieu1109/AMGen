Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To determine the number of intersection points, we need to analyze the periodicity and behavior of the functions involved. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| are both piecewise linear and periodic with period 1. When composed with trigonometric functions, they create periodic patterns. The function h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period of 1, and k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) has a period of 2/3. The system repeats every 2/3 units due to the least common multiple of the periods. Within one period of 2/3, we must count the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy both equations. By analyzing one period of both functions, we find that there are 6 intersection points per period of 2/3 for x. Since y has a period of 1, over one complete cycle of y (which is 3 cycles of x), we multiply these 6 points by 3, giving a total of 18 intersection points. Therefore, the correct number of intersection points is 18.
