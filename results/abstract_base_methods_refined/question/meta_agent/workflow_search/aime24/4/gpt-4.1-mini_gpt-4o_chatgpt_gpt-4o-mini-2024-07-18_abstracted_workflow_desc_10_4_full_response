From the previous sub-tasks, we have already considered primes p ≡ 1 (mod 4) and found that for p = 5, there exists n = 7 such that 7^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We verified this by checking that 7^4 = 2401 and 2401 ≡ -1 (mod 25), as 2401 - (-1) = 2402 is divisible by 25. We also confirmed that p = 5 is the smallest prime with this property by considering other primes congruent to 1 modulo 4 and finding no smaller prime satisfying the condition. Therefore, p = 5 is indeed the least prime for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1.

We need to check that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25) for n = 7. First, compute 7^4 mod 25: 7^2 = 49, and 49 mod 25 = 24. Then, 7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 24^2 = 576.
