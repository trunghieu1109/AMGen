proposed answer: We have determined that the least prime p is 3. We need to find the least positive integer m such that 3^2 divides m^4 + 1. This means we need m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9), or equivalently, m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). We will test small values of m to find the smallest one that satisfies this condition. 

Let's test m = 1: 
1^4 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 2: 
2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 3: 
3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 4: 
4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 5: 
5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 6: 
6^4 + 1 = 1296 + 1 = 1297, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 7: 
7^4 + 1 = 2401 + 1 = 2402, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 8: 
8^4 + 1 = 4096 + 1 = 4097, which is not divisible by 9.

m = 9: 
9^4 + 1 = 6561 + 1 = 6562, which is divisible by 9.

Therefore, the least positive integer m such that 3^2 divides m^4 + 1 is 9.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we determined that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 is p = 5. We need to find all positive integers n modulo 25 (since p^2 = 25) such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). From the residue table computed in Sub-task 1, we found that for n = 7, 7^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We need to check if there are any other n values that satisfy this condition. By computing n^4 modulo 25 for n = 1 to 24, we find that n = 7 is indeed the only solution in this range. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is m = 7.

Answer:The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is 7.
