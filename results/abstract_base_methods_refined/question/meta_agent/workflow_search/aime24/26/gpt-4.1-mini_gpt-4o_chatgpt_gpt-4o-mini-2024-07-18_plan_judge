Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_26
proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, the elements of the set A were determined to be {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. To find the sum of these elements, we simply add them together: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.

Answer:55
Extracted answer: 55
Correct answer: 055
