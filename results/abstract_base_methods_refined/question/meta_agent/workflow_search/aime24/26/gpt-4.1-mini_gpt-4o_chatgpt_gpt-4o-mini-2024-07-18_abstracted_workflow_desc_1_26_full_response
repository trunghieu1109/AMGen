Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The condition is that the total number of such sets B is 2024. For each element a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum element is a is 2^a - 1, because for each element from 1 to a, we can choose to include it or not, except we must include a, and the set cannot be empty. Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^a - 1 for each a in A.

For each element from 1 to m, we can choose to include it or not in the set B, which gives us 2^m possible subsets. However, we must ensure that the set is nonempty and the maximum element is m, which means m must be included and at least one other element must be included if m is not the only element.

Therefore, if Alice chooses a set A = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}, the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum of 2^(a_i - 1) for each a_i in A.

The total number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m} is 2^m, as each element can either be included or not included. However, we need to consider only the nonempty subsets that have m as their maximum element. This means we must include m in the subset, and we can choose to include or not include each of the elements 1 through m-1. This gives us 2^(m-1) choices for the elements 1 through m-1. Therefore, the number of nonempty sets B with maximum element m is 2^(m-1).
