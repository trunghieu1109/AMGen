Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

The number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). Here, n = 10 and k = 4, so we calculate C(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210.

There are C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 numbers from the 4 randomly chosen numbers. Jen must also choose 2 numbers from the 6 numbers not chosen in the random draw (since there are 10 numbers total and 4 are chosen randomly, leaving 6 unchosen).
