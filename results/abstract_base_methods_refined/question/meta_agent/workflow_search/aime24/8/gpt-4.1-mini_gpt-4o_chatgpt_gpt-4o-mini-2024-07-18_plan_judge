Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice. A position is losing for the player to move if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position. From the sub-task analysis, we know that a position n is losing for Alice if both n-1 and n-4 are winning positions. By iterating through all n from 1 to 2024, we can classify each position as winning or losing. The pattern identified is that losing positions for Alice (and thus winning for Bob) are those where n is of the form 5k + 2. We need to count the number of such integers n less than or equal to 2024. The sequence of numbers of the form 5k + 2 starts at 2 and increments by 5 each time: 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 2024. The largest such number is 2022, which is 5 * 404 + 2. Therefore, the sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022, which is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 2, common difference d = 5, and last term a_n = 2022. The number of terms in this sequence is given by n = ((2022 - 2) / 5) + 1 = 405. Thus, there are 405 such numbers, and Bob has a winning strategy for these 405 positions.

proposed answer: From the previous analysis, we have determined that the losing positions for Alice, which are winning positions for Bob, are those where n is of the form 8k. This means that for n to be a losing position for Alice, n must be a multiple of 8. We need to count how many such multiples of 8 exist from 1 to 2024. The smallest positive multiple of 8 is 8 * 1 = 8, and the largest multiple of 8 less than or equal to 2024 is 8 * 253 = 2024. Therefore, the multiples of 8 from 1 to 2024 are 8, 16, 24, ..., 2024. These numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 8, common difference d = 8, and last term a_n = 2024. The number of terms in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Solving for n gives: 2024 = 8 + (n-1) * 8, which simplifies to 2024 = 8n, so n = 253. Therefore, there are 253 positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
