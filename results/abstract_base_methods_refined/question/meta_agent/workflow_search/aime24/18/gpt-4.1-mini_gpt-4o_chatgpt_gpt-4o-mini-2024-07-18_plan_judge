Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: Both agents have analyzed the problem and reached the same conclusion. The unique point C on the segment \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) other than \( \overline{AB} \) itself is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), which is \( C = \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right) \). This is because the slope of \( \overline{AB} \) is \( \sqrt{3} \), and the only \( \theta \) that makes the slope of \( \overline{PQ} \) equal to \( \sqrt{3} \) is when \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \), which corresponds to the segment being exactly \( \overline{AB} \). The distance \( OC \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \). The fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \) is already in its simplest form, with \( p = 1 \) and \( q = 4 \). Thus, \( p + q = 5 \).

proposed answer: The problem involves finding a unique point C on the segment AB that does not lie on any other unit-length segment PQ in the family F, except for AB itself. The family F consists of segments PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, satisfying x^2 + y^2 = 1. The segment AB is parametrized, and the point C(t) is expressed in terms of t. The condition for C(t) to lie on a segment PQ is formulated, involving the parameter lambda and the unit length condition. The unique t* is found to be 1/3, where C(t*) does not lie on any other segment in F. The coordinates of C(t*) are calculated, and OC^2 is computed as 7/36. The fraction is in simplest form, and the sum p + q is 43. All steps are consistent with the problem's geometric constraints, and the final answer satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the final answer is correct.
