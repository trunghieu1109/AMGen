The point C(t) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is given by \\(C(t) = \\left(\\frac{1-t}{2}, \\frac{t\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\).

The family F consists of segments PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, satisfying x^2 + y^2 = 1. The segment AB is parametrized, and the point C(t) is expressed in terms of t.

Substituting these into the unit circle equation gives: \\(\\left(\\frac{1-t}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{t\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = 1\\).

The point C(t) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is given by \\(C(t) = \\left(\\frac{1-t}{2}, \\frac{t\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\). For C(t) to lie on a segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\), there must exist points P = (p, 0) and Q = (0, q) such that the distance between P and Q is 1, i.e., \\(p^2 + q^2 = 1\\), and C(t) is a linear combination of P and Q, i.e., \\(C(t) = (1-\\lambda)P + \\lambda Q\\) for some \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\).
