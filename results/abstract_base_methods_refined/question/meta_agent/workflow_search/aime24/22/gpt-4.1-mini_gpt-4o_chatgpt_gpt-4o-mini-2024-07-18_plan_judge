Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_22
proposed answer: Since there are no verified candidate lists that satisfy all the conditions, there is no list for which we can compute the sum of the squares of the items. Therefore, the task of computing the sum of the squares cannot be performed as there is no valid list to work with.

Answer:There are no verified candidate lists, so the sum of the squares cannot be computed.
Extracted answer: There are no verified candidate lists, so the sum of the squares cannot be computed.
Correct answer: 236
