Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we have determined that the greatest four-digit integer N with the property that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7 is 8998. When 8998 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 8 and the remainder R is 998. Therefore, the sum Q + R is calculated as 8 + 998, which equals 1006. This calculation is consistent with the problem statement and the sub-task analysis.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check downwards. For each candidate N, we change each digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7. After testing, we find that N = 9983 satisfies the condition: changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Now, we divide 9983 by 1000 to find the quotient Q and remainder R. 9983 divided by 1000 gives a quotient Q = 9 and a remainder R = 983. Therefore, Q + R = 9 + 983 = 992.
