Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we determined that the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is equal to 1. This is because the polynomial \( P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \) evaluated at the 13th roots of unity results in a product of 1, as shown by the properties of cyclotomic polynomials and roots of unity. Since the product is 1, when we take this result modulo 1000, the remainder is still 1. Therefore, the remainder when the original product is divided by 1000 is 1.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, the exact value of the original product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) was found to be 3970. To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we simply compute 3970 modulo 1000. The operation 3970 mod 1000 gives us the remainder of 970, since 3970 divided by 1000 is 3 with a remainder of 970. This calculation is consistent with the verification done in Sub-task 7, which supports the correctness of the result obtained in Sub-task 6.
