The conditions are that 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1, meaning x is the most significant digit and y is the least significant digit. The integer n in base 10 is then x * b + y. The sum of the digits x and y must equal the square root of n, i.e., x + y = \u221an. Therefore, for a number n to be b-eautiful, it must satisfy these conditions: n = x * b + y and \u221an = x + y, where x and y are within the specified ranges.; answer - A b-eautiful integer n is a positive integer that can be expressed in base b as a two-digit number with digits x and y such that 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of n.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To derive the mathematical relationship between n, b, x, and y, we start with the conditions given for a b-eautiful integer. We have n = x * b + y, where x is the most significant digit and y is the least significant digit in base b. Additionally, we have the condition that the sum of the digits, x + y, equals the square root of n, i.e., x + y = \u221an. From these equations, we can express \u221an in terms of x and y: \u221an = x + y. Squaring both sides gives us n = (x + y)^2. We now have two expressions for n: n = x * b + y and n = (x + y)^2. By setting these equal, we get the relationship x * b + y = (x + y)^2. This equation relates n, b, x, and y and must hold for n to be b-eautiful. This relationship captures the conditions for n being b-eautiful in terms of the base b and the digits x and y.; answer - The relationship is x * b + y = (x + y)^2, where n = x * b + y and x + y = \u221an.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To express the condition x + y = sqrt(n) in terms of b, x, and y, we start with the given relationship: n = x * b + y and x + y = sqrt(n). Squaring both sides of the second equation gives us n = (x + y)^2. We also have n = x * b + y. Setting these two expressions for n equal gives us x * b + y = (x + y)^2. This equation involves only b, x, and y. To find all possible digit pairs (x, y) that satisfy this condition for a given b, we need to solve the equation x * b + y = (x + y)^2 for integer values of x and y, where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1. This involves checking each possible pair (x, y) within these ranges to see if they satisfy the equation. The solution will depend on the specific value of b, as the ranges for x and y are determined by b. The limitation is that for each specific base b, you must check all possible pairs (x, y) where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1 to find which pairs satisfy the equation.

To find all possible digit pairs (x, y) for a given b, solve this equation for integer values of x and y, where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In base b, a two-digit number is expressed as x * b + y, where x is the most significant digit and y is the least significant digit. The constraints for x and y are 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1. This is because x cannot be 0 (as it is the most significant digit) and y can be any digit from 0 to b-1. The condition for a number n to be b-eautiful is that the sum of the digits x and y equals the square root of n, i.e., x + y = \u221an. Therefore, the valid ranges for x and y are determined by these constraints: x ranges from 1 to b-1, and y ranges from 0 to b-1.; answer - The valid ranges for digits x and y given base b are: x from 1 to b-1, and y from 0 to b-1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine all b-eautiful integers for a fixed base b, we need to consider all possible digit pairs (x, y) where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1. For each pair, we calculate the number n = x * b + y and check if the sum of the digits, x + y, equals the square root of n, i.e., x + y = sqrt(n). This condition ensures that the number n is b-eautiful. By systematically checking each pair, we can identify all b-eautiful integers for the given base b. This process involves iterating over all possible values of x and y within their respective ranges and verifying the condition for each pair.

The procedure involves starting from b = 2 and incrementing b by 1 each time, applying the enumeration and counting process for each base. We continue this process until we find a base where the count of b-eautiful integers exceeds ten. This approach ensures that we systematically check each base and find the smallest one that meets the condition. The limitation of this procedure is that it can be computationally expensive as the base increases, since for each base b, we need to check all possible digit pairs and perform square root calculations, which can be slow for large bases. However, this is a straightforward and systematic approach to find the solution.; answer - Iterate over bases b starting from 2, apply the procedure to find b-eautiful integers, and stop when the count exceeds ten.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, we need to consider the process of finding b-eautiful integers for each base.
