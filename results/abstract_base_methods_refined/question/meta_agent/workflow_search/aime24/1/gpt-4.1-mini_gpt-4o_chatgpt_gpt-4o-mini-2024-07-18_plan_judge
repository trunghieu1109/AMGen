Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: The length of AP has already been calculated in sub-task 7 as 108/13. The problem asks for AP to be expressed in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. In this case, m = 108 and n = 13. We need to check if 108 and 13 are relatively prime, which means they have no common divisors other than 1. Since 13 is a prime number and does not divide 108, 108 and 13 are indeed relatively prime. Therefore, the simplest fractional form of AP is 108/13. The problem then asks for the sum m + n, which is 108 + 13 = 121. This is the final answer.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the length AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle, where AP is the length from point A to point P, the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle. The solution involves using properties of tangents, symmedians, and reflections across the circumcenter. The coordinates of A and P are used to calculate the distance AP. The solution provided in the related sub-task indicates that AP is calculated to be 45/7, which is already in simplest form since 45 and 7 are coprime. Therefore, m = 45 and n = 7, and their sum is m + n = 52. This matches the answer given in the sub-task, confirming its correctness.
