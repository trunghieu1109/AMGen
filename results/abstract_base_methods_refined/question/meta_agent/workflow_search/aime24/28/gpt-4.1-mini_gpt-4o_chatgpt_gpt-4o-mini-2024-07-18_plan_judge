Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem requires us to find the sum of m and n, where the difference r_i - r_o is expressed as a simplified fraction m/n. From the related sub-task, we determined that the difference is 4, which can be written as the fraction 4/1. Since 4 and 1 are relatively prime, this fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, m = 4 and n = 1. The sum m + n is 4 + 1, which equals 5. This is the final answer as it directly follows from the simplified fraction and the problem's requirements.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, the difference between the radii of tangency circles, r_i and r_o, was calculated as -3. To meet the problem's requirement of expressing this difference as a positive fraction with relatively prime integers, we take the absolute value, which is 3. This can be expressed as the fraction 3/1, where m = 3 and n = 1. These integers are relatively prime, and their sum is m + n = 3 + 1 = 4. This approach is consistent with the problem's requirement to express the difference as a positive fraction and to find the sum of the integers m and n.
