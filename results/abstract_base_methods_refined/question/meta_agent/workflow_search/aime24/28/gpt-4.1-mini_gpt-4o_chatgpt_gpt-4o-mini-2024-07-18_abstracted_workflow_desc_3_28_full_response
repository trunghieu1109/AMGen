Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$.

The difference r_i - r_o is calculated as 2 - 5 = -3. However, the problem requires the difference to be expressed as a positive fraction with relatively prime positive integers m and n. Therefore, we take the absolute value of the difference, which is 3, and express it as the fraction 3/1. Here, m = 3 and n = 1, which are relatively prime positive integers. Thus, m + n = 3 + 1 = 4.

Here, m = 3 and n = 1 are relatively prime positive integers, so their sum is 3 + 1 = 4.

The difference is calculated as r_i - r_o = 2 - 5 = -3. However, the problem specifies that m and n should be positive integers, and the difference should be written as a positive fraction. To address this, we consider the absolute value of the difference, which is 3. This can be expressed as the fraction 3/1, where m = 3 and n = 1 are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, m + n = 3 + 1 = 4. The simplification is verified by ensuring that the fraction is in its simplest form and meets the condition of positive integers.; answer: 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, deciding simplified fraction, thinking: In Sub-task 5, the radii of the circles of tangency were found to be r_i = 2 and r_o = 5. The difference r_i - r_o is calculated as 2 - 5 = -3. However, the problem requires the difference to be expressed as a positive fraction with relatively prime positive integers m and n. Therefore, we take the absolute value of the difference, which is 3, and express it as the fraction 3/1. Here, m = 3 and n = 1, which are relatively prime positive integers. Thus, m + n = 3 + 1 = 4. This solution is consistent with the conditions provided and ensures the fraction is in its simplest form with positive integers.; answer: 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent G6zp, computing sum m+n, thinking: In Sub-task 6, the difference between the radii of tangency circles, r_i and r_o, was found to be -3. Taking the absolute value gives 3, which can be expressed as the fraction 3/1. Here, m = 3 and n = 1 are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the sum m + n is 3 + 1 = 4. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to express the difference as a positive fraction with relatively prime integers and to find the sum of these integers.; answer: 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent AhdJ, providing feedback, thinking: The computation of the sum m+n is correct based on the given information. The difference r_i - r_o was found to be -3, and taking the absolute value gives 3, which can be expressed as the fraction 3/1. Here, m = 3 and n = 1 are relatively prime positive integers, so their sum is 3 + 1 = 4. The limitation is that the problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, which is negative, but the solution takes the absolute value to express it as a positive fraction. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to express the difference as a positive fraction with relatively prime integers.; answer: 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent G6zp, refining sum computation, thinking: In Sub-task 6, the difference between the radii of tangency circles, r_i and r_o, was calculated as -3. To meet the problem's requirement of expressing this difference as a positive fraction with relatively prime integers, we take the absolute value, which is 3. This can be expressed as the fraction 3/1, where m = 3 and n = 1. These integers are relatively prime, and their sum is m + n = 3 + 1 = 4. This approach is consistent with the problem's requirement to express the difference as a positive fraction and to find the sum of the integers m and n.; answer: 4", iteration_idx=1)]
