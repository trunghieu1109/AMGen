Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: To find the total number of valid maximal chip placements on the 5x5 grid, we consider the constraints: each row and column must have chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. For each k from 0 to 5, we can choose k rows and k columns to form a k x k subgrid, and fill it with chips of one color. The remaining k*(5-k) cells in the chosen rows and k*(5-k) cells in the chosen columns are also filled with the same color, totaling 5k chips. The number of ways to choose k rows from 5 is C(5, k), and the number of ways to choose k columns from 5 is C(5, k). For each choice, we have 2 color options (all white or all black). Therefore, the total number of configurations is the sum over k of C(5, k)^2 * 2. Calculating this gives: for k=0, 1 way; for k=1, 50 ways; for k=2, 200 ways; for k=3, 300 ways; for k=4, 150 ways; for k=5, 2 ways. Summing these gives 1 + 50 + 200 + 300 + 150 + 2 = 703. Thus, the total number of valid maximal chip placements is 703.

proposed answer: The problem involves placing 25 white and 25 black indistinguishable chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column contains chips of only one color, and the configuration is maximal. The key insight is that for a given k (0 <= k <= 5), if there are k white rows and k white columns, there are k^2 white chips placed on the grid. The remaining 5-k rows and 5-k columns are black, resulting in (5-k)^2 black chips. The total number of chips placed is k^2 + (5-k)^2 = 2k^2 - 10k + 25, which must not exceed 25 white chips and 25 black chips. This condition is naturally satisfied for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For each k, there are C(5,k) ways to choose the white rows and C(5,k) ways to choose the white columns, leading to C(5,k)^2 configurations. Summing over all k from 0 to 5 gives the total number of configurations: C(5,0)^2 + C(5,1)^2 + C(5,2)^2 + C(5,3)^2 + C(5,4)^2 + C(5,5)^2 = 1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252. This matches the enumeration from Sub-task 6 and respects the chip availability from Sub-task 7, confirming the final count is correct. There are no discrepancies or errors in the verification process.
