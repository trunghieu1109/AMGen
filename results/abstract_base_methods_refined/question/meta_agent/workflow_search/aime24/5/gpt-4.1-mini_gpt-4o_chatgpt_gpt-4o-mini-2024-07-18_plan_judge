Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to each face, and it can be calculated using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. From the related sub-task, it was determined that the inradius is \( \frac{4 \sqrt{10}}{5} \). This expression is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) with m = 4, n = 10, and p = 5. These values satisfy the conditions: m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 4 + 10 + 5 = 19. This is the final answer required by the problem.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we determined that the inradius of the tetrahedron, which is the common perpendicular distance from the incenter to each face, can be expressed in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \), where \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are positive integers, \( m \) and \( p \) are coprime, and \( n \) is square-free. The problem asks for the sum \( m + n + p \). According to the answer provided by Chain-of-Thought Agent jCol, the sum \( m + n + p \) is 22. This means that after simplifying the expression for the inradius, the values of \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) were found such that their sum is 22. Therefore, the final integer answer required by the problem is 22.
