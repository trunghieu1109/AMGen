Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: The original expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We found that the real part of this expression can be expressed as 324cos(θ) - 432sin(θ), where θ is the argument of z. In Sub-task 5, we determined that the maximum value of this trigonometric expression is 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part of the original expression is 540, as this is the maximum value that the real part can achieve given the constraints.
