A complex number in polar form is expressed as r(cos θ + i sin θ), where r is the magnitude and θ is the argument. Since |z| = 4, we can express z in polar form as z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ). This representation captures all possible complex numbers z with magnitude 4, as θ varies from 0 to 2π.; answer - z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To rewrite the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z in terms of θ, we first substitute z with its polar form z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ). We also need to express 1/z in terms of θ. Since z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), 1/z is the reciprocal, which can be written as 1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)). Simplifying this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, obtaining 1/z = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). Now we substitute these into the expression: (75 + 117i)(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). Simplifying, we get: (75*4 + 117*4i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (96/4 + 144/4i)(cos θ - i sin θ). This simplifies to (300 + 468i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (24 + 36i)(cos θ - i sin θ).; answer - (300 + 468i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (24 + 36i)(cos θ - i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To separate the real part of the expression obtained in Sub-task 2, we need to expand the expression and identify the terms that contribute to the real part. The expression is (300 + 468i)(cos θ + i sin θ) + (24 + 36i)(cos θ - i sin θ). We expand each product separately. For (300 + 468i)(cos θ + i sin θ), we have: 300cos θ + 300i sin θ + 468i cos θ - 468 sin θ. The real part here is 300cos θ - 468sin θ. For (24 + 36i)(cos θ - i sin θ), we have: 24cos θ - 24i sin θ + 36i cos θ + 36sin θ. The real part here is 24cos θ + 36sin θ. Adding the real parts from both expansions, we get: (300cos θ - 468sin θ) + (24cos θ + 36sin θ) = 324cos θ - 432sin θ.

This is already in the form A cos θ + B sin θ, where A = 324 and B = -432. To simplify this into a single trigonometric expression, we use the identity A cos θ + B sin θ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and φ is the angle such that cos φ = A/R and sin φ = B/R. First, we calculate R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. Next, we find φ such that cos φ = 324/540 = 3/5 and sin φ = -432/540 = -4/5. This corresponds to an angle φ in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the expression 324cos θ - 432sin θ can be written as 540 cos(θ - φ), where φ is the angle whose cosine is 3/5 and sine is -4/5. This transformation is valid and allows us to easily find the maximum value of the expression, which is R = 540, since the maximum value of cos(θ - φ) is 1.; answer - 540 cos(θ - φ) where cos φ = 3/5 and sin φ = -4/5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Both agents have correctly identified that the expression 324cos θ - 432sin θ can be rewritten in the form 540 cos(θ - φ), where 540 is the amplitude of the cosine function.

We also need to express 1/z in terms of θ. Since z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), 1/z is the reciprocal, which can be written as 1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)). Simplifying this, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, obtaining 1/z = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). Now we substitute these into the expression: (75 + 117i)(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ).

The reciprocal of z is 1/z = (cos θ - i sin θ)/4 by the property of complex conjugates and magnitudes. Substituting these into the expression, we get (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)4(cos θ + i sin θ) and (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)(cos θ - i sin θ)/4. Simplifying these, we have: (75 + 117i)z = 4(75 cos θ - 117 sin θ + i(75 sin θ + 117 cos θ)) and (96 + 144i)/z = (96 cos θ + 144 sin θ - i(96 sin θ - 144 cos θ))/4. Combining these, the expression becomes: 4(75 cos θ - 117 sin θ) + (96 cos θ + 144 sin θ)/4 + i[4(75 sin θ + 117 cos θ) - (96 sin θ - 144 cos θ)/4].; answer: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = 4(75 cos θ - 117 sin θ) + (96 cos θ + 144 sin θ)/4 + i[4(75 sin θ + 117 cos θ) - (96 sin θ - 144 cos θ)/4]\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent M1AO, rewrite expression in terms of θ, thinking: We have z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ) from Sub-task 1. The reciprocal, 1/z, is given by (cos θ - i sin θ)/4 because the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form r(cos θ + i sin θ) is (cos θ - i sin θ)/r. We can substitute these into the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. First, (75 + 117i)z becomes (75 + 117i) * 4(cos θ + i sin θ). This simplifies to (300 cos θ - 468 sin θ) + i(300 sin θ + 468 cos θ). Next, (96 + 144i)/z becomes (96 + 144i) * (cos θ - i sin θ)/4. This simplifies to (24 cos θ + 36 sin θ) + i(24 sin θ - 36 cos θ). Adding these two results gives: [(300 cos θ - 468 sin θ) + (24 cos θ + 36 sin θ)] + i[(300 sin θ + 468 cos θ) + (24 sin θ - 36 cos θ)]. Simplifying further, the real part is (300 cos θ - 468 sin θ + 24 cos θ + 36 sin θ) = 324 cos θ - 432 sin θ, and the imaginary part is (300 sin θ + 468 cos θ + 24 sin θ - 36 cos θ) = 324 sin θ + 432 cos θ.
