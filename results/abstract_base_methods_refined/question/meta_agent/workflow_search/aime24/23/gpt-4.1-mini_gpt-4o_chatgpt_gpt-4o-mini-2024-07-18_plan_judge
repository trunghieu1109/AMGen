Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, we enumerated all possible assignments of digits to the grid cells that satisfy the given conditions. We found 9 valid assignments: (1) d11 = 0, d12 = 0, d13 = 8, d21 = 9, d22 = 9, d23 = 1; (2) d11 = 0, d12 = 1, d13 = 7, d21 = 9, d22 = 8, d23 = 2; (3) d11 = 0, d12 = 2, d13 = 6, d21 = 9, d22 = 7, d23 = 3; (4) d11 = 0, d12 = 3, d13 = 5, d21 = 9, d22 = 6, d23 = 4; (5) d11 = 0, d12 = 4, d13 = 4, d21 = 9, d22 = 5, d23 = 5; (6) d11 = 0, d12 = 5, d13 = 3, d21 = 9, d22 = 4, d23 = 6; (7) d11 = 0, d12 = 6, d13 = 2, d21 = 9, d22 = 3, d23 = 7; (8) d11 = 0, d12 = 7, d13 = 1, d21 = 9, d22 = 2, d23 = 8; (9) d11 = 0, d12 = 8, d13 = 0, d21 = 9, d22 = 1, d23 = 9. Each of these assignments satisfies both the horizontal sum condition (sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999) and the vertical sum condition (sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99). Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 9.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, we found that there are 900 possible ways to assign digits to the grid cells such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. This was done by considering the constraints a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9, and counting the number of valid pairs for each constraint. For (a, d), there are 9 possibilities, and for both (b, e) and (c, f), there are 10 possibilities each. Multiplying these gives 9 * 10 * 10 = 900. This count is accurate because it considers all possible digit assignments that satisfy the given constraints, and no additional constraints were introduced that would reduce this count. Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 900.
