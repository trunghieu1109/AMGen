Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we set up the equation |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. Given the numbers: |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562, and the number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, while those owning exactly three items is 234. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. From the setup, it was derived that |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 671, and the number of residents owning exactly one item plus those owning all four items is 229. Solving the inclusion-exclusion equation: 671 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + |A ∩ B ∩ C|, we find |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 16. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 16. This conclusion is consistent with the results from the sub-tasks, confirming that 16 residents own all four items.

Answer:16 residents own all four items.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, we derived the equation 900 = x1 + 437 + 234 + x4, where x1 is the number of residents owning exactly one item, x2 is the number owning exactly two items (437), x3 is the number owning exactly three items (234), and x4 is the number owning all four items. Simplifying this equation gives us 900 = x1 + 671 + x4, which further simplifies to x1 + x4 = 229. Since we are asked to find x4, the number of residents owning all four items, we can solve for x4 by assuming that x1 and x4 account for the remaining residents after accounting for those owning exactly two or three items. Therefore, x4 = 229, as it is the remaining balance of the equation.
