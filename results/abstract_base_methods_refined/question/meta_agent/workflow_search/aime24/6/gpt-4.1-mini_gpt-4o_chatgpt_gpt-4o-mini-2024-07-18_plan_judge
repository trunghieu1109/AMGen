Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_6
proposed answer: From Sub-task 7, we have determined that the radius squared, r^2, of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is 355/81. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 355 and 81 are relatively prime. Therefore, p = 355 and q = 81. The sum p + q is 355 + 81.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, we calculated r^2 as 323/216. We verified that this fraction is already in its simplest form, meaning that the numerator 323 and the denominator 216 are relatively prime. Therefore, p = 323 and q = 216. The sum p + q is 323 + 216, which equals 539. This matches the answer provided in Sub-task 7, confirming that the calculation is correct.
