    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, convert \(AP\) into \(rac{m}{n}\) and find \(m + n\). 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent ZGXq:
Given AP=100/13 from sub-task 3, we have m=100 and n=13, so m+n=113.

### thinking by Debate Agent 34tm:
Using the result AP = 100/13, we have m = 100 and n = 13, so m + n = 113.

### answer by Debate Agent ZGXq:
113

### answer by Debate Agent 34tm:
113

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
