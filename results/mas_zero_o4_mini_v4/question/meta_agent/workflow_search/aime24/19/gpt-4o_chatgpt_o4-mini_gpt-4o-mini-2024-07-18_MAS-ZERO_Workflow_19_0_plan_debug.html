    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent IEez:
We need ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) where ω runs over 13th roots of unity.  Note 2−2x+x^2=(x−(1+i))(x−(1−i)), so the product is Res(x^13−1, x^2−2x+2)=((1+i)^13−1)((1−i)^13−1).  Compute (1±i)^13=(√2)^13e^{±i13π/4}=2^6(−1∓i)=−64∓64i, so each minus 1 gives −65∓64i, product=(−65)^2+(64)^2=4225+4096=8321.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent IEez:
8321

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZTak (yourself):
We have the product value 8321 from sub-task 2. Compute 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZTak (yourself):

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, review the remainder calculation and refine if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent bDXc:
The calculation 8321 mod 1000 = 321 is correct; no refinement needed.
