Viewing f(x)=x^2 -2x+2, the product over all roots of x^13−1 equals the resultant of x^13−1 and f(x).  By symmetry this equals ∏_{β: f(β)=0}(β^13−1).  The roots are β=1±i, and (1+i)^13=−64(1+i), so (β^13−1)(β̄^13−1)=(−65−64i)(−65+64i)=8321.; answer: 8321\nCoT agent 8OrA, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: We need the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}), where ω runs over the 13th roots of unity. Note 2−2x+x^2=x^2−2x+2 with roots r=1±i. By the resultant formula, P = ∏_{ζ^13=1}f(ζ)=∏_{roots r}(r^13−1)=( (1+i)^13−1 )( (1−i)^13−1 ). Since 1±i=√2 e^{±iπ/4}, (1+i)^13=2^{6.5}e^{i13π/4}=−64−64i and similarly (1−i)^13=−64+64i.
