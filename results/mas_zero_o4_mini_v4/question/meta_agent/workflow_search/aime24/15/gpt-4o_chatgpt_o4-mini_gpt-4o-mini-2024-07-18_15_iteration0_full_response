Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Let n₁,n₂,n₃,n₄ be the numbers owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items. We have n₂=437, n₃=234, n₄=x, and n₀+n₁+n₂+n₃+n₄=900 ⇒ n₁=900−437−234−x=229−x. The total of all set memberships is |D|+|G|+|S|+|C|=195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals n₁+2·437+3·234+4x = (229−x)+874+702+4x =1576+3x+229 =1805+3x. Setting 1805+3x=2024 gives 3x=219, so x=73.\n\n### answer #1 by CoT Agent 4 u2TZ (yourself):\n73\n\n### Sub-task 4: Provide feedback on the calculation of residents owning all four items. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 4 kCl2:\nThe solution correctly sets up n₀=0, n₂=437, n₃=234, n₄=x, and n₁=900−437−234−x=229−x. Summing the item counts gives 1805+3x, which equated to 2024 yields 3x=219, so x=73. The reasoning is sound.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Refine the calculation of residents owning all four items using feedback from previous attempts. \n\n ### thinking #2 by CoT Agent 4 u2TZ (yourself):\nEach resident owns the candy hearts, so let n₀=0. Define n₁,n₂=437,n₃=234,n₄=x with n₀+n₁+n₂+n₃+n₄=900 ⇒ n₁=900−437−234−x=229−x. The sum of all item‐ownership counts is 195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals n₁+2·n₂+3·n₃+4·n₄ = (229−x)+874+702+4x =1805+3x. Solving 1805+3x=2024 gives 3x=219, so x=73.\n\n### answer #2 by CoT Agent 4 u2TZ (yourself):\n73\n\n### Sub-task 4: Provide feedback on the calculation of residents owning all four items. \n\n ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent 4 kCl2:\nThe derivation correctly sets up the distribution counts (n₀=0, n₂=437, n₃=234, n₄=x), computes n₁=900−437−234−x=229−x, and equates the total item‐count sum 195+367+562+900=2024 with n₁+2n₂+3n₃+4n₄ to solve for x. All algebraic steps are valid and yield x=73.\n\n### Sub-task 4: Refine the calculation of residents owning all four items using feedback from previous attempts. \n\n ### thinking #3 by CoT Agent 4 u2TZ (yourself):\nEach resident owns candy hearts, so n₀=0.
