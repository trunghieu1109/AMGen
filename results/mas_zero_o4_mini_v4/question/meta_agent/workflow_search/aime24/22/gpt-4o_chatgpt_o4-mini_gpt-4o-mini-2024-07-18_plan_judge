Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The oversight was failing to enumerate all even‚Äêlength lists when f=2. By listing all distinct pairs of positive integers (not 9) summing to 12 and checking which give an integer median not in the list, only [5,7,9,9] works. Its median is (7+9)/2=8 (absent) and 9 is the unique mode.
