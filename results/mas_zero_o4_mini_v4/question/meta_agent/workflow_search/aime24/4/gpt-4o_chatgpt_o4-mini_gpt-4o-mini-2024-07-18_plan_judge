Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 4_Iteration_0
proposed answer: We have p=17 from sub-task 1. To find the least m>0 with m^4+1≡0 mod17^2, we solve m^4≡−1 mod289. The fourth-power residues mod17 give m≡2,8,9,15. Hensel lifting m=m0+17k for each yields solutions m≡110,134,155,179 mod289. The smallest positive is 110.
