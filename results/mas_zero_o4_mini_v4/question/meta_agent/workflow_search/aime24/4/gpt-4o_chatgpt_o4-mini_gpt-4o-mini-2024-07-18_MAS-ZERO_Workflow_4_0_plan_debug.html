    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent oWb3:
We test primes in increasing order for existence of n with p^2 | n^4+1. 2,3,5,7 fail as no solution to n^4 ≡ -1 mod p. Next candidate is p ≡1 mod8, the smallest being 17. One finds n=2 mod17 gives 2^4+1≡0 mod17 and Hensel lifting yields n≡155 mod289 so 289|n^4+1. Hence p=17.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent oWb3:
17

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WIUn (yourself):
We need the least m&gt;0 with m^4≡−1 mod17^2=289. First find solutions mod17: a^4≡−1 mod17 gives a≡2,8,9,15. For each n0 compute Hensel lift n=n0+17k solving n^4+1≡0 mod289 via k≡−r*(4n0^3)^{-1} mod17, where r=(n0^4+1)/17 mod17. Calculations yield lifts m≡155,110,179,134 mod289. The smallest positive is 110.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WIUn (yourself):
110

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 5vSG:
The proposed value m=110 is correct. It is the smallest positive solution of m^4≡−1 mod 17^2.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WIUn (yourself):
We seek the least m&gt;0 with m^4≡−1 mod17^2. First find solutions mod17: m≡2,8,9,15. Apply Hensel lifting: m=m0+17k and solve m^4+1≡0 mod289 to find k mod17. This yields lifts m≡155,110,179,134 mod289. The smallest positive is 110.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WIUn (yourself):
110

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent 5vSG:
The guess 110 is correct. It satisfies 110^4+1≡0 mod 17^2, and among the four Hensel lifts (110, 134, 155, 179), 110 is the least positive solution.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WIUn (yourself):
We look for the smallest m&gt;0 with m^4 ≡ -1 mod 17^2. First the solutions mod 17 are m ≡ 2, 8, 9, 15. Using Hensel lifting m = m0 + 17k, we solve m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289 to find k mod 17 for each m0. The lifts are m ≡ 155, 110, 179, 134 mod 289, and the smallest positive solution is 110.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WIUn (yourself):
110

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent 5vSG:
The guess 110 is correct: one checks 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17^2 (289), and among the lifted solutions 110, 134, 155, 179 the smallest positive is indeed 110.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

    <pre>We have p=17 from sub-task 1. To find the least m&gt;0 with m^4+1≡0 mod17^2, we solve m^4≡−1 mod289. The fourth-power residues mod17 give m≡2,8,9,15. Hensel lifting m=m0+17k for each yields solutions m≡110,134,155,179 mod289. The smallest positive is 110.
