Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

A convenient parametric form is C(t)=A+t(B−A) = (1/2,0)+t(−1/2,√3/2).; answer: Equation of AB: y = −√3 x + √3/2.  Parametric representation: C(t) = (1/2 − t/2, t·√3/2), for t ∈ ℝ (or t∈[0,1] to run from A to B).\nCoT agent svFC, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: A segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant must have P=(x,0) with x≥0, Q=(0,y) with y≥0, and satisfy the distance formula √((x−0)²+(0−y)²)=1, i.e. x²+y²=1.; answer: For any segment in ℱ, P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x≥0, y≥0, and x²+y²=1.\nCoT agent 7nue, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: A segment PQ in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis must have endpoints P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x,y≥0 and satisfy the unit‐length condition. The interior of the segment lies in the first quadrant if x>0 and y>0. Hence we get x²+y²=1, x>0, y>0.; answer: Let P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x>0, y>0 and\nx²+y²=1.

Its intersection with line AB (y=−√3x+√3/2) occurs when θ=60°, giving t=3/4 in the AB‐parameterization C(t)=(1/2−t/2, t√3/2) so C=(1/8,3√3/8).; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nCritic agent Uckq, on the purpose of sub-task 3, feedback: The computed point C=(1/8,3√3/8) is indeed the unique point on AB (apart from A and B) not covered by any other unit‐length segment from the axes. It arises as the sole intersection of line AB with the astroid envelope of the family F.; correct: Uniqueness confirmed; C=(1/8,3√3/8).\nCoT agent DYQv, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: The unique point C is the envelope point where line AB intersects the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1, the envelope of unit‐length chords from the axes. Substituting y=−√3x+√3/2 into x^{2/3}+(−√3x+√3/2)^{2/3}=1 and solving yields x=1/8, then y=3√3/8.; answer: C=(1/8,3√3/8)\nCritic agent Uckq, on the purpose of sub-task 3, feedback: The point C is indeed unique because it arises as the sole intersection of line AB with the astroid envelope of all unit‐length chords from the coordinate axes. Solving x^{2/3}+(−√3x+√3/2)^{2/3}=1 yields exactly one solution in (0,½) for x, and hence exactly one corresponding y, so no other point on AB satisfies the condition.; correct: C=(1/8,3√3/8)\nCoT agent DYQv, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: We look for the point C on line AB that is not covered by any other unit‐length segment from the axes. The envelope of all such segments is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1. Substituting the line AB equation y=−√3 x+√3/2 into the astroid equation and solving yields the unique solution x=1/8, y=3√3/8.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nCritic agent Uckq, on the purpose of sub-task 3, feedback: The explanation correctly identifies that the envelope of all unit‐length segments with endpoints on the axes is given by the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1, and shows that intersecting this envelope with line AB yields the single solution C=(1/8,3√3/8). This intersection argument guarantees that no other point on AB shares the same property, confirming uniqueness.; correct: C=(1/8,3√3/8) is indeed the unique point on AB not covered by any other segment in 𝓕.\nCoT agent DYQv, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: We know the envelope of unit‐length chords with endpoints on the axes is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1. Intersecting this with line AB: y=−√3 x+√3/2, we substitute and solve x^{2/3}+(−√3x+√3/2)^{2/3}=1, yielding the unique solution x=1/8, then y=3√3/8. This gives the unique point C on AB not covered by any other unit segment from the axes.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nDebate agent DxRa, round 0, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: Given C=(1/8,3√3/8), we compute OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16.; answer: 7/16\nDebate agent 0dzW, round 0, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: From C=(1/8,3√3/8), OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16.; answer: 7/16\nDebate agent DxRa, round 1, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: Given C=(1/8,3√3/8), compute OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.; answer: 7/16\nDebate agent 0dzW, round 1, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: From C = (1/8, 3√3/8), we compute OC² = (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.; answer: 7/16\nDebate agent DxRa, round 2, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: Given C = (1/8, 3√3/8), we compute OC² = (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.; answer: 7/16\nDebate agent 0dzW, round 2, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: Given C=(1/8,3√3/8), we compute OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16.; answer: 7/16\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: Given the point C=(1/8,3√3/8), we compute OC² = (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.; answer: 7/16', iteration_idx=-1)]
