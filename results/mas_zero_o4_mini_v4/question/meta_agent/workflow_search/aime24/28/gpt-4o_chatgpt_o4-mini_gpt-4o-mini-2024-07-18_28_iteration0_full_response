Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Thus the tube radius is 3 and the distance from the axis to the circle’s center (the revolution radius) is 6.; answer: The radius of the torus is 3 and its revolution distance is 6.\nCoT-SC agent Lbfy, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: We know the torus’s generating circle has radius 3 and its center is 6 from the torus axis.  If we place the torus so its axis is a vertical line a distance h above the sphere’s center, then the distance from the sphere center to the generating‐circle center is d=√(h²+6²).  External tangency occurs when that distance equals the sphere’s radius plus or minus the tube radius (11±3).; answer: Let h be the vertical distance from the sphere’s center to the torus axis.  Then the distance d from the sphere’s center to the torus generating‐circle center is d=√(h²+6²).  Tangency occurs exactly when d equals 11+3 or 11–3, i.e. when √(h²+6²)=14 or √(h²+6²)=8.\nCoT-SC agent bOp3, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: To have the torus touch the sphere externally along the tube, the center of the generating circle (at distance 6 from the torus axis) must lie at a distance from the sphere’s center so that the tube’s radius 3 just reaches the sphere’s radius 11.  Thus for the inner‐side contact we need (center–to–center distance) minus 3 =11, and for the outer‐side contact we need (center–to–center distance) plus 3 =11.; answer: The torus is tangent exactly when the distance d between the sphere’s center and the center of the torus’s generating circle satisfies\nd – 3 = 11  (inner contact) or\nd + 3 = 11  (outer contact),\ni.e. d = 14 or d = 8.\nCoT-SC agent mKU8, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is generated by a circle of radius r=3 whose center moves on a circle of radius R=6 (the torus axis). For the sphere of radius S=11 to be tangent along a toroidal circle, its center must lie on the torus axis at some distance d from that axis so that the distance between the sphere center and the generating‐circle center equals either the sum or difference of the radii.  Concretely:; answer: The sphere’s center lies on the torus axis, and if d is that distance from the axis then tangency occurs exactly when |d−6|=11+3=14 (outer tangency) or |d−6|=|11−3|=8 (inner tangency).\nCoT agent ByeX, on the purpose of calculating difference in radii, thinking: We have h² =160 or 28 from √(h²+6²)=14,8. Using normals-parallel gives z = Rh/6. Substituting into sphere and torus equations yields R² =4356/(36+h²). For h²=160, R²=1089/49 ⇒R=33/7; for h²=28, R²=1089/16⇒R=33/4. Thus the difference =33/4 - 33/7 =33·3/28 =99/28.; answer: 99/28\nCritic agent poOy, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The derivation correctly finds the two contact‐circle radii 33/4 and 33/7 and their difference 99/28.
