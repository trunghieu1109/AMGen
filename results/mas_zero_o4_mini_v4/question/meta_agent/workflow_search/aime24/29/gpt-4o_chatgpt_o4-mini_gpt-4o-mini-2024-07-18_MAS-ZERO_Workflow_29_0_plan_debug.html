    <pre>Related original question:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Determine the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent XJpk:
We can assign up to all 5 rows and all 5 columns a single color (white or black) without violating the uniform‐color rule or chip‐count constraints.  Filling 5 rows uses 25 chips; similarly for columns, and overlaps count only once.  Thus the maximum is 5 rows and 5 columns.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent XJpk:
5 rows and 5 columns.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent eYrd:
Given that the maximum is achieved when either all 5 rows or all 5 columns (or both) are filled of one colour, the total chips placed is 5×5 + 5×5 − 5×5 = 25.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent eYrd:
25

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, verify that the placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Since filling all 5 rows (or equivalently all 5 columns) places a chip in each of the 25 cells, the grid is completely occupied. Adding any more chips would require placing a second chip in an already occupied cell, violating the “at most one chip per cell” condition. Therefore, no further chip can be added without breaking the rules.

Answer:The placement is optimal: all 25 cells are occupied, so any additional chip would violate the at most one chip per cell condition.</pre>
