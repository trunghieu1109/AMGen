Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 29_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Since filling all 5 rows (or equivalently all 5 columns) places a chip in each of the 25 cells, the grid is completely occupied. Adding any more chips would require placing a second chip in an already occupied cell, violating the “at most one chip per cell” condition. Therefore, no further chip can be added without breaking the rules.

Answer:The placement is optimal: all 25 cells are occupied, so any additional chip would violate the at most one chip per cell condition.
Extracted answer: The placement is optimal: all 25 cells are occupied, so any additional chip would violate the at most one chip per cell condition.
Correct answer: 902
