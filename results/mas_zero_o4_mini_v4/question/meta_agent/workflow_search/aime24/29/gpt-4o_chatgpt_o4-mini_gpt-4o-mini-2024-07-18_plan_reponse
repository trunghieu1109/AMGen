Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.",

        "response": "Since filling all 5 rows (or equivalently all 5 columns) places a chip in each of the 25 cells, the grid is completely occupied. Adding any more chips would require placing a second chip in an already occupied cell, violating the \u201cat most one chip per cell\u201d condition. Therefore, no further chip can be added without breaking the rules.\n\nAnswer:The placement is optimal: all 25 cells are occupied, so any additional chip would violate the at most one chip per cell condition.",
