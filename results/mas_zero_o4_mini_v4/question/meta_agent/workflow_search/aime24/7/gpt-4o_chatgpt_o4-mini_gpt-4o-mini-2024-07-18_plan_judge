Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 7_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Using y = 25/x gives xy = 25. Numerically, x ≈ 1.5336 and y ≈ 16.304 also yield xy ≈ 25.0038, confirming the exact product is 25.
