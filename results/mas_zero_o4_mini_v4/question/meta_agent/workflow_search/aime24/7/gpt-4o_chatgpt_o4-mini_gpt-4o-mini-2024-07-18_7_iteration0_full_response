Substituting back gives the transcendental condition x ln 25=(x+10) ln x, which determines x (and then y=25/x).; answer: y=25/x and x must satisfy x ln 25=(x+10) ln x\nCritic agent vEjB, on the purpose of reviewing solutions, thinking: The algebraic manipulations are correct. From x·ln y = 10·ln x you get ln y = (10 ln x)/x. Substituting into 4y·ln x = 10·ln y gives y = 25/x. Plugging back yields the transcendental condition x ln 25 = (x+10) ln x, which indeed determines x (and then y = 25/x).; answer: y = 25/x with x satisfying x ln 25 = (x + 10) ln x\nCoT agent dzAs, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: Starting from x ln y = 10 ln x and 4y ln x = 10 ln y we get ln y = (10 ln x)/x and hence y = 25/x. Substituting back yields the transcendental equation x·ln25 = (x+10)·ln x, which we solve numerically. Using iteration gives x ≈ 1.5336 and then y = 25/x ≈ 16.304.; answer: x ≈ 1.5336, y ≈ 16.304\nCritic agent vEjB, on the purpose of reviewing solutions, thinking: The derivation of y=25/x and the resulting equation x·ln25=(x+10)·lnx is sound. However, since the problem only asks for the product xy, you can immediately conclude from y=25/x that xy=25 without solving for x and y individually. The numerical approximations for x and y are unnecessary.; answer: xy=25\nCoT agent dzAs, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: From x·ln y = 10·ln x and 4y·ln x = 10·ln y we get ln y = (10 ln x)/x, hence y = 25/x. Substituting back gives x·ln25 = (x+10)·ln x, a transcendental equation. Solving numerically yields x ≈ 1.5336 and y = 25/x ≈ 16.304.; answer: x ≈ 1.5336, y ≈ 16.304\nCritic agent vEjB, on the purpose of reviewing solutions, thinking: The derivation incorrectly jumps from ln y = (10 ln x)/x to y = 25/x. In fact ln y = (10 ln x)/x implies y = x^(10/x), and only by substituting into the second equation do you obtain y = 25/x. The resulting transcendental equation (x+10)ln x = x ln 25 is correct, and solving it numerically gives the stated values.; answer: x ≈ 1.5336, y ≈ 16.304\nCoT agent dzAs, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: From x·ln y = 10·ln x and 4y·ln x = 10·ln y we get ln y = (10 ln x)/x.
