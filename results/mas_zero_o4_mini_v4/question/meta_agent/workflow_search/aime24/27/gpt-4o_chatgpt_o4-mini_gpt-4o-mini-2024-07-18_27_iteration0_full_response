No missing information prevents specifying these constraints.; answer: Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d with a∈{1,…,9}, b,c,d∈{0,…,9}. The requirements are: 1) Changing the thousands digit to 1: 1000·1+100b+10c+d ≡0 (mod 7). 2) Changing the hundreds digit to 1: 1000a+100·1+10c+d ≡0 (mod 7). 3) Changing the tens digit to 1: 1000a+100b+10·1+d ≡0 (mod 7). 4) Changing the units digit to 1: 1000a+100b+10c+1 ≡0 (mod 7).\nCoT-SC agent spf4, on the purpose of finding N, thinking: We set N=1000a+100b+10c+d and derived 4 modular constraints when replacing each digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7. Working mod 7 yields:\n(1) 2b+3c+d≡1\n(2) 6a+3c+d≡5→3a−b≡2\n(3) 6a+2b+d≡4→2a−c≡1\n(4) 6a+2b+3c≡6\nSolving gives a≡5 mod7→a=5; c≡2a−1≡9 mod7→c=9; b≡3a−2≡6 mod7→b=6; then d≡1−2b−3c≡4 mod7→d=4. Thus N=5694.; answer: 5694\nCoT-SC agent iGse, on the purpose of finding N, thinking: We set N=1000a+100b+10c+d and require that replacing each digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Reducing 1000≡6,100≡2,10≡3 mod7, we get these congruences: (1)2b+3c+d≡1;(2)-a+3c+d≡5;(3)-a+2b+d≡4;(4)-a+2b+3c≡6 (mod7). Solving these gives a≡5mod7⇒a=5, then b≡6mod7⇒b=6, then c≡2mod7⇒c=2 or9. To maximize N we take c=9, and then d≡1−2b−3c≡4mod7⇒d=4. Thus the greatest N is 1000·5+100·6+10·9+4=5694.; answer: 5694\nCoT-SC agent QwNS, on the purpose of finding N, thinking: We set N=1000a+100b+10c+d and write the four congruences mod 7 given by replacing each digit with 1. Solving these yields b≡6 (mod 7)⇒b=6, then a=5, c=2, d=4, so N=5624, which indeed makes each 1‐digit‐replacement divisible by 7. No larger four‐digit solution exists.; answer: 5624\nCoT-SC agent Ww51, on the purpose of finding N, thinking: We derive modular constraints for each digit replacement, then solve a≡6k+1, b≡4k+1, c≡5k+1, d≡k+1 (mod7) and enforce N≡k≡(6a+2b+3c+d) mod7.
