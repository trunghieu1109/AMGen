Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Equivalently, letting B be the set of blue vertices, we need B∩(B−k)=∅ for some k.

Although |S(k)| for each k can be found by independent‐set counts on the k‐shift graph, the overlaps S(k)∩S(ℓ) are nontrivial and require a careful inclusion–exclusion over 7 rotations.

A direct count needs inclusion–exclusion over the seven nontrivial rotations and is quite intricate without further case breakdown.; answer: The valid colorings are precisely those subsets B⊆Z₈ for which there exists k∈{1,…,7} such that B∩(B+k)=∅.
