Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The inclusion–exclusion computation from Sub-task 3 is incomplete because the sizes of the intersections |S(k)∩S(ℓ)| (and higher) were never provided. Without those explicit values, we cannot correctly compute |⋃_{k=1}^7 S(k)| or the resulting probability, so we cannot reliably simplify to m/n or find m+n.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the values of |S(k)∩S(ℓ)| for all 1≤k<ℓ≤7 (and higher intersections if needed) so that the inclusion–exclusion sum can be completed and the true m+n determined.
