Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: The intersection problem requires solving a nontrivial system of piecewise‐linear equations with multiple monotonic branches in x and y (two periods in x, three in y), yielding many cases. A full case‐by‐case solution is lengthy and intricate. Best approach is to break the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] into the subintervals where |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| fall into each of the four regions, write the linear formulas in each region, and solve for intersection in each cell. This decomposition is necessary for an exact count.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Decompose the unit square into the intervals where a=|sin(2πx)| and u=|cos(3πy)| lie in [0,¼], [¼,½], [½,¾], [¾,1], derive the four linear formulas for y=Y(x) and x=X(y) in each cell, and then solve each linear system to count intersections. This case–by–case decomposition will yield the exact finite count of intersection points.
