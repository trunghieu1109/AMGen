    <pre>Related original question:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ycx5:
Each configuration corresponds to choosing positive run‐lengths summing to 8 for R‐runs and U‐runs.  For “Start with R”: compositions of 8 into 3 parts (C(7,2)=21) times compositions of 8 into 2 parts (C(7,1)=7) gives 21·7=147.  Similarly for “Start with U”: compositions of 8 into 3 U‐runs (C(7,2)=21) times compositions of 8 into 2 R‐runs (C(7,1)=7) gives 147.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ycx5:
Start with R: 147 valid paths; Start with U: 147 valid paths.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent NgIm (yourself):
To get the total, add the two counts: 147 + 147 = 294.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent NgIm (yourself):
294

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent wl8n:
The aggregation of the two counts (147 + 147) to get 294 is correct.

### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent NgIm (yourself):
To aggregate, add the number of paths starting with R (147) to those starting with U (147).

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent NgIm (yourself):
294

### feedback #2 by Critic Agent wl8n:
The aggregation 147+147=294 is correct.

### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent NgIm (yourself):
We aggregate the two subcounts (paths starting with R and paths starting with U), each 147, so 147+147=294.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent NgIm (yourself):
294

### feedback #3 by Critic Agent wl8n:
Aggregating the two subcounts (147 each) yields 147+147=294.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
