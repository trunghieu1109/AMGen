    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output from sub-task 1, calculate the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D using the equations of the diagonals and the condition that these points lie on the hyperbola. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3uzk:
The diagonals x=0 and y=0 intersect the hyperbola x²/20–y²/24=1 only on y=0 at x=±√20, giving two points. There is no real intersection with x=0 (y²=−24), so B and D cannot be found under these assumptions.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3uzk:
A = (2√5, 0)
C = (−2√5, 0)
[TOO_HARD]
The hyperbola does not intersect the y-axis, so no real points B and D exist; please verify the diagonal alignment or provide further constraints.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output from sub-task 2, compute BD^2 and determine the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We parametrize rhombus diagonals through origin by A=(x1,y1), C=(-x1,-y1), B=(x2,y2), D=(-x2,-y2) on hyperbola x²/20–y²/24=1. Perpendicular diagonals give y1*y2=−x1*x2.  One finds that B must satisfy x2²&gt;720/11 so BD²=4(x2²+y2²)=(44/5)x2²−96&gt; (44/5)*(720/11)−96=480. Hence infimum of BD² is 480, the greatest real less than all BD².
