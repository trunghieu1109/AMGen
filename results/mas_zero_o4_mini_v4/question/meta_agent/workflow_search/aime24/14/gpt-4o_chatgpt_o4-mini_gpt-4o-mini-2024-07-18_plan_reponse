        "n": "MAS-ZERO Workflow 14_Iteration_0",
        "response": "We parametrize rhombus diagonals through origin by A=(x1,y1), C=(-x1,-y1), B=(x2,y2), D=(-x2,-y2) on hyperbola x\u00b2/20\u2013y\u00b2/24=1. Perpendicular diagonals give y1*y2=\u2212x1*x2.  One finds that B must satisfy x2\u00b2>720/11 so BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2+y2\u00b2)=(44/5)x2\u00b2\u221296> (44/5)*(720/11)\u221296=480. Hence infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, the greatest real less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nAnswer:480",
