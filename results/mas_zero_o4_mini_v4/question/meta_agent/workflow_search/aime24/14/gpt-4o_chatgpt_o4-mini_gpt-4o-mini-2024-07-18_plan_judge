Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We parametrize rhombus diagonals through origin by A=(x1,y1), C=(-x1,-y1), B=(x2,y2), D=(-x2,-y2) on hyperbola x²/20–y²/24=1. Perpendicular diagonals give y1*y2=−x1*x2.  One finds that B must satisfy x2²>720/11 so BD²=4(x2²+y2²)=(44/5)x2²−96> (44/5)*(720/11)−96=480. Hence infimum of BD² is 480, the greatest real less than all BD².
