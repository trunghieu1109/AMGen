Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "We need the smallest base b such that the number of b-beautiful integers exceeds 10. A b-beautiful integer corresponds to each S in [\u2308\u221ab\u2309,b\u22121] with b\u22121 dividing S(S\u22121). Since S and S\u22121 are coprime, each factorization b\u22121=d\u2081\u00b7d\u2082 (with gcd(d\u2081,d\u2082)=1) gives one solution S. Thus the count equals the number of such factor pairs, namely 2^\u03c9(b\u22121), minus the trivial S=1 if outside range. To exceed 10 we need \u03c9(b\u22121)\u22654. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210=2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77, so b\u22121=210 \u21d2 b=211, giving about 15 solutions (>10).\n\nAnswer:211",
