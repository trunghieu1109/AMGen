Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 00Yu', content='We need the smallest base b such that the number of b-beautiful integers exceeds 10. A b-beautiful integer corresponds to each S in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] with b−1 dividing S(S−1). Since S and S−1 are coprime, each factorization b−1=d₁·d₂ (with gcd(d₁,d₂)=1) gives one solution S. Thus the count equals the number of such factor pairs, namely 2^ω(b−1), minus the trivial S=1 if outside range. To exceed 10 we need ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210=2·3·5·7, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211, giving about 15 solutions (>10).\n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Squaring x+y=√n gives the condition (x+y)²=bx+y.; answer: A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, say n = x·b + y with 1≤x≤b−1 and 0≤y≤b−1, and these digits satisfy x + y = √n. Equivalently, a necessary and sufficient condition is (x + y)² = b·x + y.\nCoT-SC agent cRe0, on the purpose of exploring b-beautiful integers, thinking: A b-beautiful integer n must be two‐digit in base b so n=x·b+y with 1≤x≤b−1,0≤y≤b−1 and x+y=√n an integer S. Hence n=S² and b≤n≤b²−1 so S ranges over integers with ⌈√b⌉≤S≤b−1. For each such S we check if S² can be written as x·b+y with x+y=S.; answer: For a given base b, all candidate b-beautiful numbers lie in [b,\u2009b²−1] and must be perfect squares n=S² with S an integer satisfying ⌈√b⌉≤S≤b−1.

Since n< b² and n=(x+y)², we require x+y< b. Also to be two‐digit we need n≥b ⇒ x+y≥√b. Let t=x+y. Then t runs over integers t with √b≤t<b, so t=ceil(√b), …, b−1. Hence the candidate b‐beautiful n are exactly t² in that range.\n; answer: For a given base b, the only possible b‐beautiful integers are the perfect squares n=t² with t an integer satisfying ceil(√b)≤t≤b−1. Equivalently, they lie in the interval [ceil(√b)²,\u2009(b−1)²].\nCoT-SC agent sKFV, on the purpose of exploring b-beautiful integers, thinking: A b-beautiful n must be two‐digit in base b so b≤n≤b^2−1, and n=(x+y)^2 with x=⌊n/b⌋, y=n mod b, x+y=√n.  Hence √n=s must be integer, b≤s^2≤b^2−1, so s runs from ⌈√b⌉ to b−1.  Thus all b-beautiful n are squares s^2 with ⌈√b⌉≤s≤b−1.; answer: For a given base b, the possible b-beautiful integers are exactly the perfect squares s^2 with s an integer satisfying ⌈√b⌉≤s≤b−1.
