    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the properties from sub-task 1, calculate the range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent cRe0:
A b-beautiful integer n must be two‐digit in base b so n=x·b+y with 1≤x≤b−1,0≤y≤b−1 and x+y=√n an integer S. Hence n=S² and b≤n≤b²−1 so S ranges over integers with ⌈√b⌉≤S≤b−1. For each such S we check if S² can be written as x·b+y with x+y=S.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent cRe0:
For a given base b, all candidate b-beautiful numbers lie in [b, b²−1] and must be perfect squares n=S² with S an integer satisfying ⌈√b⌉≤S≤b−1. Each such S² yields n=x·b+y exactly when there exist digits x,y with x+y=S.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such integers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We need the smallest base b such that the number of b-beautiful integers exceeds 10. A b-beautiful integer corresponds to each S in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] with b−1 dividing S(S−1). Since S and S−1 are coprime, each factorization b−1=d₁·d₂ (with gcd(d₁,d₂)=1) gives one solution S. Thus the count equals the number of such factor pairs, namely 2^ω(b−1), minus the trivial S=1 if outside range. To exceed 10 we need ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210=2·3·5·7, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211, giving about 15 solutions (&gt;10).
