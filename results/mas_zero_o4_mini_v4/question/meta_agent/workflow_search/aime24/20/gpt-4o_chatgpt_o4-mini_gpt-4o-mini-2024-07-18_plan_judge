Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We need the smallest base b such that the number of b-beautiful integers exceeds 10. A b-beautiful integer corresponds to each S in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] with b−1 dividing S(S−1). Since S and S−1 are coprime, each factorization b−1=d₁·d₂ (with gcd(d₁,d₂)=1) gives one solution S. Thus the count equals the number of such factor pairs, namely 2^ω(b−1), minus the trivial S=1 if outside range. To exceed 10 we need ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210=2·3·5·7, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211, giving about 15 solutions (>10).
