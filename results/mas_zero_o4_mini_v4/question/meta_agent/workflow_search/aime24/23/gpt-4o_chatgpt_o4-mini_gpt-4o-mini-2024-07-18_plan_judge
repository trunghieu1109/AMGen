Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 23_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Sub-tasks 3 and 4 both yield the same list of 36 (top‐row; bottom‐row) triples, so all 36 combinations satisfy both the L–R sum=999 and the vertical sum=99.

Answer:The 36 common combinations are:
(1,0,7; 8,9,2),
(1,1,6; 8,8,3),
(1,2,5; 8,7,4),
(1,3,4; 8,6,5),
(1,4,3; 8,5,6),
(1,5,2; 8,4,7),
(1,6,1; 8,3,8),
(1,7,0; 8,2,9),
(2,0,6; 7,9,3),
(2,1,5; 7,8,4),
(2,2,4; 7,7,5),
(2,3,3; 7,6,6),
(2,4,2; 7,5,7),
(2,5,1; 7,4,8),
(2,6,0; 7,3,9),
(3,0,5; 6,9,4),
(3,1,4; 6,8,5),
(3,2,3; 6,7,6),
(3,3,2; 6,6,7),
(3,4,1; 6,5,8),
(3,5,0; 6,4,9),
