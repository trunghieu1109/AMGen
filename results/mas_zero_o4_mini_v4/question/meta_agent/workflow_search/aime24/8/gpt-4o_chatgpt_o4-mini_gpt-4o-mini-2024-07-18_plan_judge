Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 8_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Bob wins when n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5. Up to 2024 there are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 and floor((2024-2)/5)+1=405 numbers ≡2 mod 5, totalling 404+405=809.

Answer:809
