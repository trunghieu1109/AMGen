    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the losing positions for Alice from Sub-task 1, determine the winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking by CoT-SC Agent IVzQ:
Since Bob is the second player, he wins exactly when the starting position is a losing position for Alice. From Sub-task 1 those are n≡0 or 2 mod 5.

### answer by CoT-SC Agent IVzQ:
The winning positions for Bob are precisely those n with n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7xAG (yourself):
We need the count of n ≤ 2024 with n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5. Multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5)=404. Numbers ≡2 mod5: from 2 to 2022 gives ((2022−2)/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405. Total = 404 + 405 = 809.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7xAG (yourself):
809

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent CEbR:
The reasoning correctly identifies that Bob’s winning positions are those where n mod 5 is 0 or 2. There are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 and 405 numbers ≡2 mod 5 up to 2024, giving 404+405=809.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7xAG (yourself):
The positions where Bob wins are those where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5. Up to 2024 there are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 and also 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, giving 404+405=809.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7xAG (yourself):
809

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent CEbR:
Your reasoning and calculation for the count are correct.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7xAG (yourself):
The positions where Bob wins are those with n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5. Up to 2024 there are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 and 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, yielding 404+405=809.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7xAG (yourself):
809

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent CEbR:
The answer 809 is correct, since there are 404 multiples of 5 (n ≡ 0 mod 5) and 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to 2024, giving a total of 809.

Given the above, answer the following question: Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
