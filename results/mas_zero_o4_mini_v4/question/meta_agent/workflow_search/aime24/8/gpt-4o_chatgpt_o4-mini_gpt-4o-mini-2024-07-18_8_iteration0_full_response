Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

A position is losing (P-position) iff all moves lead to winning positions. Computing small values shows the losing positions follow a 5-periodic pattern: n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,… which are exactly those n≡0 or 2 mod\u20095.; answer: The losing positions are precisely those n with n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).\nCoT-SC agent IVzQ, on the purpose of determining winning positions for Bob, thinking: Since Bob is the second player, he wins exactly when the starting position is a losing position for Alice.
