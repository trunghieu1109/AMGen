        "response": "We know from sub\u2010task 2 that the three triangle sides are 200=s\u00b7|u\u2212v|, 240=s\u00b7|v\u2212w|, 300=s\u00b7|w\u2212u| with u+v+w=0 and |u|=|v|=|w|=1.  A standard identity gives |u\u2212v|\u00b2+|v\u2212w|\u00b2+|w\u2212u|\u00b2=9.  Hence (200/s)\u00b2+(240/s)\u00b2+(300/s)\u00b2=9 \u21d2 (40000+57600+90000)/s\u00b2=9 \u21d2187600/s\u00b2=9 \u21d2s\u00b2=187600/9= (400\u00b7469)/9 \u21d2s=(20/3)\u221a469.\n\nAnswer:(20\u221a469)/3",
