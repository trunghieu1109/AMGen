    <pre>Related original question:

Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine how the side lengths of the triangle relate to the side length of the hexagon. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent c6oM:
From sub-task 1 we know AB, CD, EF are equal‐length vectors of length s in three directions u,v,w with u+v+w=0.  The triangle formed by the lines AB, CD, EF has side between the intersections of the lines parallel to u and v equal to the distance |AB−CD| = s·|u−v|, and similarly for the other two sides.  Hence its three side‐lengths are exactly s·|u−v|,  s·|v−w|,  and s·|w−u|.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent c6oM:
If s is the common side of the hexagon and u,v,w are the unit direction‐vectors of AB, CD, EF with u+v+w=0, then the triangle’s side‐lengths are
200 = s·|u−v|,
240 = s·|v−w|,
300 = s·|w−u|.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, calculate the side length of the hexagon ABCDEF.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We know from sub‐task 2 that the three triangle sides are 200=s·|u−v|, 240=s·|v−w|, 300=s·|w−u| with u+v+w=0 and |u|=|v|=|w|=1.  A standard identity gives |u−v|²+|v−w|²+|w−u|²=9.  Hence (200/s)²+(240/s)²+(300/s)²=9 ⇒ (40000+57600+90000)/s²=9 ⇒187600/s²=9 ⇒s²=187600/9= (400·469)/9 ⇒s=(20/3)√469.
