Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 25_Iteration_0
proposed answer: We know from sub‐task 2 that the three triangle sides are 200=s·|u−v|, 240=s·|v−w|, 300=s·|w−u| with u+v+w=0 and |u|=|v|=|w|=1.  A standard identity gives |u−v|²+|v−w|²+|w−u|²=9.  Hence (200/s)²+(240/s)²+(300/s)²=9 ⇒ (40000+57600+90000)/s²=9 ⇒187600/s²=9 ⇒s²=187600/9= (400·469)/9 ⇒s=(20/3)√469.
