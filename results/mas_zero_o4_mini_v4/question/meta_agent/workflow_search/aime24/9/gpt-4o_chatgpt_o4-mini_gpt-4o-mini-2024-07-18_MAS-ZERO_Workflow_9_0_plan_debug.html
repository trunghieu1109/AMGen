    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the outputs from sub-task 3 and 4, calculate the probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 matches). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent XboD:
Sub-task 3 gives P(win any prize) = 115/210. Sub-task 4 gives # ways to match all 4 = 1 out of 210. Thus the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given winning any prize is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent XboD:
1/115

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, find m and n such that the probability of winning the grand prize given a prize is m/n, and compute m+n. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qq0Q (yourself):
Sub-task 5 gives the conditional probability as 1/115, so m=1 and n=115. Hence m+n=1+115=116.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qq0Q (yourself):
116

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, review and criticize the calculation of m and n. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent ea49:
The derivation is sound. With 10 choose 4 = 210 equally likely draws, the counts for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches are 90, 24, and 1 respectively, so P(at least 2 matches)=115/210 and P(grand prize)=1/210. Hence P(grand|prize)=(1/210)/(115/210)=1/115. The fraction is already in lowest terms.

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, refine the calculation to find m and n and compute m+n. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qq0Q (yourself):
Sub-task 5 gives conditional probability = 1/115, so m=1 and n=115, thus m+n=116.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qq0Q (yourself):
116

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, review and criticize the calculation of m and n. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent ea49:
The calculation is correct. The probability of winning the grand prize given winning any prize is P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115, so m = 1 and n = 115, yielding m + n = 116.

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, refine the calculation to find m and n and compute m+n. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qq0Q (yourself):
Sub-task 5 gave P(grand prize | prize) = 1/115, so m=1 and n=115. Therefore m+n=116.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qq0Q (yourself):
116

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, review and criticize the calculation of m and n. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent ea49:
The calculation correctly finds that there are 115 prize‐winning outcomes (at least 2 matches) and only 1 grand‐prize outcome, so P(grand | prize)=1/115 and thus m=1, n=115.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from sub-task 5, refine the calculation to find m and n and compute m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
