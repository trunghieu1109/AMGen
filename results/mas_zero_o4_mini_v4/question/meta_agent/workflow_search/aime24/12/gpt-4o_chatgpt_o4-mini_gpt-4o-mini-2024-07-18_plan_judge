proposed answer: To maximize R(θ)=324 cosθ−432 sinθ we set R′(θ)=0 ⇒ −324 sinθ−432 cosθ=0 ⇒ tanθ=−4/3. This yields θ=−arctan(4/3)+πn. Checking the second derivative shows a maximum when the shift is 2π, so θ=−arctan(4/3)+2πk.

Answer:θ = -arctan(4/3) + 2πk (equivalently θ = 2π - arctan(4/3) in [0,2π))
Extracted answer: θ = -arctan(4/3) + 2πk (equivalently θ = 2π - arctan(4/3) in [0,2π))
Correct answer: 540
