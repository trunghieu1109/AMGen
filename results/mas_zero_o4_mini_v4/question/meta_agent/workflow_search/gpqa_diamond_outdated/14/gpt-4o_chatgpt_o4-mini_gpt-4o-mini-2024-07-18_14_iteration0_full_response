Both stars have equal radii so drop R★. For Planet 1: M★1=2, P1=1 → ∝2^(–1/3)·1^(–2/3)=2^(–1/3)≈0.79. For Planet 2: M★2=1, P2=3 → ∝1^(–1/3)·3^(–2/3)=3^(–2/3)≈0.48. Hence P1/P2≈0.79/0.48≈1.65.; answer: Transit probability ∝ M★^(–1/3)P^(–2/3): Planet_1 ≈2^(–1/3)≈0.79 (arb. units), Planet_2 ≈3^(–2/3)≈0.48, so Planet_1’s transit probability is ≈1.65× that of Planet_2.\nCoT-SC agent c5eC, on the purpose of verifying calculations, thinking: To verify consistency, we repeatedly apply P_trans∝M★^(–1/3)P^(–2/3) with different normalizations or rounding schemes. In every recalculation—for example using P1=1\u2009unit,P2=3\u2009units or P1=2,P2=6—the ratio remains 2^(–1/3)/3^(–2/3)≈0.7937/0.4807≈1.65.
