Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To find ΔE from Δp, use E=p^2/(2m) so dE/dp = p/m = v (nonrelativistic). From sub-task 1, Δp ≃ħ/(2Δx) ≃5.3×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s and v=2×10⁸ m/s. Thus ΔE ≃v·Δp ≃2×10⁸×5.3×10⁻²⁵ ≃1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J, rounded to 1.1×10⁻¹⁶ J.

Answer:ΔE ≃ 1.1×10⁻¹⁶ J
Extracted answer: ΔE ≃ 1.1×10⁻¹⁶ J
Correct answer: 2
