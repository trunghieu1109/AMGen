The 5.5 ppm dq shows the other vinylic proton coupling to a methyl (doublet) and to the adjacent vinyl proton (quartet). The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) corresponds to the methyl group on the alkene. The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is characteristic of an acetate methyl. These shifts, coupling patterns, and coupling constants pinpoint a trans-propenyl acetate framework with an acetate ester.; answer: • 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16 Hz): vinylic proton trans to the other vinyl proton\n• 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): second vinylic proton, coupling to a methyl (J ≈ 7 Hz) and to the trans proton (J = 16 Hz)\n• 1.6 ppm (3H, d): methyl group attached to the alkene carbon\n• 2.1 ppm (3H, s): methyl of the acetate ester\n\nConclusion: The data indicate a trans-configured propenyl acetate (trans‐propenyl acetate).\nDebate agent oaG6, round 0, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The observed 16 Hz coupling indicates a trans double bond, matching trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\nDebate agent QNME, round 0, on the purpose of matching structural features, thinking: The large J=16 Hz coupling between vinylic protons indicates a trans-alkene.
