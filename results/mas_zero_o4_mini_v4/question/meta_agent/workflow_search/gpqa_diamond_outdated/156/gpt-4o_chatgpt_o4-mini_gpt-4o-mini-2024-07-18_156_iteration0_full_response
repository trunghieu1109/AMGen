This is straightforward: retroviruses have RNA genomes that are reverse-transcribed into cDNA, so sequencing cDNA reveals the viral genome. No additional data is needed.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent mLWz:\nRetroviruses carry their genetic material as RNA, but upon infecting a host cell they use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA genome into complementary DNA (cDNA). Sequencing cDNA rather than RNA is appropriate because:\n1. Stability: cDNA is more stable and easier to amplify and handle than single-stranded RNA, which is prone to degradation.\n2. Compatibility with sequencing and PCR: DNA templates are directly compatible with standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing workflows, enabling efficient and accurate genome characterization.\n3. Reflects full viral genome: The reverse transcription step produces a full-length DNA copy of the viral RNA genome, allowing for comprehensive identification of viral sequences, detection of mutations, and differentiation from host RNA.\n\nThus, cDNA sequencing provides a reliable, sensitive, and accurate method for identifying and characterizing retroviruses in diagnostic assays.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Make a final decision on the best diagnostic method. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent U451:\nDirect detection of viral RNA with high sensitivity and specificity, rapid turnaround, and quantitative capability makes real-time reverse transcription PCR the optimal method for quick and accurate diagnosis of retroviral infections.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent U451:\nReal-time RT-PCR\n\n### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, analyze the provided choices and determine the correct sequence of actions for designing the diagnostic kit. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):\nSub-task 1 established that retroviruses carry RNA genomes which must be reverse-transcribed into cDNA for stable, accurate sequencing.

Direct detection of viral nucleic acid by PCR offers higher sensitivity and specificity than serology during acute infection, avoids antibody-window delays, and enables quantification. ELISA detects host antibodies, which may not appear until days or weeks after infection and varies by individual immune response. Therefore, PCR–especially real-time qPCR—provides the quickest and most accurate diagnosis of retroviral infection.; answer: PCR (real-time quantitative PCR) is most suitable for quick and accurate diagnosis of retroviruses.\nDebate agent SBsG, evaluating diagnostic methods, thinking: PCR-based methods detect viral genetic material directly and provide high sensitivity and specificity, especially early in infection, whereas ELISA detects host antibodies (IgG) which require days to weeks to rise and may miss acute cases.
