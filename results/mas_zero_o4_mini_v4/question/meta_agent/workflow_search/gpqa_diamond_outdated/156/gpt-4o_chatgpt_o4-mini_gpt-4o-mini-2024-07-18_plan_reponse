            "There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?",
            "First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis",

            "First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.",
            "First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.",

Sub-task 2 identified real-time RT-PCR as the optimal rapid, sensitive, quantitative diagnostic method. Among the provided options, only choice 4 (perform cDNA sequencing then real-time PCR) matches these requirements.\n\nAnswer:D)",
