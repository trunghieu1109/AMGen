    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?&#39;, choice1=&#39;First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis&#39;, choice2=&#39;First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.&#39;, choice3=&#39;First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.&#39;, choice4=&#39;First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Understand the characteristics of retroviruses and explain why cDNA sequencing is appropriate for their identification. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent mLWz:
The user asks to explain why cDNA sequencing is appropriate for identifying retroviruses. This is straightforward: retroviruses have RNA genomes that are reverse-transcribed into cDNA, so sequencing cDNA reveals the viral genome. No additional data is needed.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent mLWz:
Retroviruses carry their genetic material as RNA, but upon infecting a host cell they use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA genome into complementary DNA (cDNA). Sequencing cDNA rather than RNA is appropriate because:
1. Stability: cDNA is more stable and easier to amplify and handle than single-stranded RNA, which is prone to degradation.
2. Compatibility with sequencing and PCR: DNA templates are directly compatible with standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing workflows, enabling efficient and accurate genome characterization.
3. Reflects full viral genome: The reverse transcription step produces a full-length DNA copy of the viral RNA genome, allowing for comprehensive identification of viral sequences, detection of mutations, and differentiation from host RNA.

Thus, cDNA sequencing provides a reliable, sensitive, and accurate method for identifying and characterizing retroviruses in diagnostic assays.

### Sub-task 2: Make a final decision on the best diagnostic method. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent U451:
Direct detection of viral RNA with high sensitivity and specificity, rapid turnaround, and quantitative capability makes real-time reverse transcription PCR the optimal method for quick and accurate diagnosis of retroviral infections.

### answer by Final Decision Agent U451:
Real-time RT-PCR

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, analyze the provided choices and determine the correct sequence of actions for designing the diagnostic kit. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):
Sub-task 1 established that retroviruses carry RNA genomes which must be reverse-transcribed into cDNA for stable, accurate sequencing. Sub-task 2 identified real-time RT-PCR as the optimal rapid, sensitive, and quantitative diagnostic approach. Among the provided options, only choice 4 integrates cDNA sequencing with a real-time PCR assay, matching both requirements.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):
D)

### Sub-task 3: Critique the decision and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent G3dO:
The rationale is sound: retroviruses have RNA genomes requiring reverse transcription to cDNA, and real-time PCR provides the rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection needed for a diagnostic kit. Choice 4 correctly integrates cDNA sequencing with real-time PCR.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, analyze the provided choices and determine the correct sequence of actions for designing the diagnostic kit. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):
Sub-task 1 clarifies that retroviruses have RNA genomes requiring reverse transcription into cDNA for stable, accurate sequencing. Sub-task 2 identifies real-time RT-PCR as the optimal rapid, sensitive, quantitative diagnostic method. Among the options, only choice 4 integrates cDNA sequencing followed by a real-time PCR assay, matching both requirements.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):
D)

### Sub-task 3: Critique the decision and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent G3dO:
The decision correctly recognizes that a retrovirus must be reverse-transcribed into cDNA before sequencing and that real-time RT-PCR provides the rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection needed for a diagnostic kit. To further strengthen the approach, one could mention design of specific primers/probes and inclusion of proper positive and negative controls.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, analyze the provided choices and determine the correct sequence of actions for designing the diagnostic kit. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):
Sub-task 1 established that retroviruses carry RNA genomes that must be reverse-transcribed into cDNA for stable, accurate sequencing. Sub-task 2 identified real-time RT-PCR as the optimal rapid, sensitive, and quantitative diagnostic method. Among the options, only choice 4 integrates cDNA sequencing followed by a real-time PCR assay, matching both requirements.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vvFT (yourself):
D)

### Sub-task 3: Critique the decision and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent G3dO:
The reasoning correctly identifies that retroviruses possess RNA genomes requiring reverse transcription into cDNA, and that real‐time RT‐PCR offers the fastest, most sensitive, and quantitative detection. Choice 4 uniquely combines cDNA sequencing for accurate primer design with real‐time PCR for rapid diagnosis, matching the sub‐task requirements.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, analyze the provided choices and determine the correct sequence of actions for designing the diagnostic kit.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
