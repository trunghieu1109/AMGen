Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 67_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The spin initially aligned along +Z precesses around the +Y field at the Larmor frequency ω=γB, so the z-component oscillates at γB, corresponding to choice B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
