This is direct from the problem statement.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9Us2:\nInitially, a uniform magnetic field of magnitude B is applied along the +Z axis, and the spin-½ particle is in the eigenstate of Sz with its magnetic moment μ=γSz aligned parallel to that field (i.e. pointing along +Z).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, analyze how the change in magnetic field direction affects the particle\'s magnetic moment. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ieey:\nThe question asks how the sudden rotation of the magnetic field from +Z to +Y affects the magnetic moment. From sub-task 1 we know the spin is initially aligned along +Z. When the field changes, the spin is no longer aligned with the new field and undergoes standard Larmor precession around the new axis. There is enough information to give a complete answer without requesting more data.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ieey:\nWhen the field is turned to +Y, the spin’s magnetic moment—initially along +Z—becomes misaligned with the new field and begins to precess about the +Y axis at the Larmor frequency ω=γB. This precession causes the expectation value of μz to oscillate sinusoidally in time.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, calculate the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent 9Us2, on the purpose of understanding initial setup, thinking: The question asks for a straightforward description of the initial setup: the direction of the applied field and the orientation of the particle’s magnetic moment before the field is switched.
