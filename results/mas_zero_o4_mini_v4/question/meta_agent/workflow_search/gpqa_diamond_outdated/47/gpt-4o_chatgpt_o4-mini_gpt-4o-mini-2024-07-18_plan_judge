proposed answer: Cyclopentane-1-carbaldehyde has one aldehyde proton and four CH2 groups whose protons can be diastereotopic and have limited symmetry. Without a clear conformational/symmetry model itâ€™s hard to assign equivalences unambiguously, but the best estimate is seven distinct proton environments.

Answer:7
[TOO_HARD]
Suggest a detailed conformational and symmetry-plane analysis of cyclopentane-1-carbaldehyde to confirm which CH2 protons are equivalent.
