Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 188_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are NG bosons of spontaneously broken symmetries, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons not arising from symmetry breaking, so the correct choice is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
