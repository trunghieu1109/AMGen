Example(question=&#39;Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?&#39;, choice1=&#39;Magnon&#39;, choice2=&#39;Skyrmion&#39;, choice3=&#39;Pion&#39;, choice4=&#39;Phonon&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent xZHT:
Magnons, pions, and phonons are Nambu–Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes, hence not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent YgWC:
Magnons, pions, and phonons are Nambu–Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, while skyrmions are topological solitons not arising from such symmetry breaking.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0isH:
Magnons, pions, and phonons are Nambu–Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken symmetries; skyrmions are topological solitons and not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

### thinking by Debate Agent OvQ5:
Magnons, pions, and phonons are Nambu–Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons and not Goldstone modes, so they are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### answer by Debate Agent xZHT:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent YgWC:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 0isH:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
