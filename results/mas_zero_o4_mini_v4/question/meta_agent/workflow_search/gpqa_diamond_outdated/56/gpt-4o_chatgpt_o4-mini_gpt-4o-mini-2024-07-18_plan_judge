Question: Example(question='Given the measured phase shifts $\\delta_o=90^o, \\delta_1=67^o, \\delta_2=55, \\delta_3=30^o$ and $\\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. ', choice1='177.675 fm\n', choice2='87163.4 fm\n', choice3='251.271 fm\n', choice4='355.351 fm', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To compute Im f(0)=1/k ∑_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l numerically we need the incident‐beam wave number k. Without k (or its relation to the 50 MeV beam), we can’t obtain the amplitude in fm. Hence the calculation is underdetermined.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the beam wave number k (or its relation to the 50 MeV energy) so we can compute Im f(0).
