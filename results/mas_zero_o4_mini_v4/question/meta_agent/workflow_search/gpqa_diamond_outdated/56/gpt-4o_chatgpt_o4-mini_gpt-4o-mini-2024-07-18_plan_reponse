Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. ",

Without k (or its relation to the 50\u2009MeV beam), we can\u2019t obtain the amplitude in fm. Hence the calculation is underdetermined.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the beam wave number k (or its relation to the 50\u2009MeV energy) so we can compute Im\u2009f(0).",
