Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 131_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Sub-task 1 yields 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene for the aromatic singlet criterion; sub-task 2 yields 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene for the methyl pattern. There is no common isomer, so the only plausible 1:1 mixture combining one candidate from each is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, although complete confirmation requires additional symmetry or coupling data.

Answer:1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide additional 2D NMR data (e.g., COSY, HSQC) or detailed symmetry analyses to confirm the proton equivalences.
Extracted answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
Correct answer: 3
