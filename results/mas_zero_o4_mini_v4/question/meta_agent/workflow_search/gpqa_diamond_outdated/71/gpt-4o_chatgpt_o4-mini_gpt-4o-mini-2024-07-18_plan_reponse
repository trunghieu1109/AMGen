        "response": "The proposed final structure is a norbornene core with two identical exo gem-dibromocyclopropane substituents at C5 and C6. Counting distinct H sets requires detailed stereochemical information on how the cyclopropane substituents are connected and oriented. Without clear stereochemical assignment and knowledge of whether the cyclopropane CH2 hydrogens are diastereotopic or equivalent, the exact number of distinct hydrogen types is ambiguous.\n\nAnswer:7\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the precise stereochemistry and connectivity of the gem-dibromocyclopropane substituents to confirm hydrogen equivalencies.",
