Example(question=&#39;Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.&#39;, choice1=&#39;-2.72 kcal&#39;, choice2=&#39;-3.80 kcal&#39;, choice3=&#39;-11.42 kcal&#39;, choice4=&#39;-16.0 kJ&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2, calculate the total enthalpy change for the neutralization reactions. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CRTI:
Total H+ moles = 0.1 + 2×0.09 = 0.28 mol; OH– moles = 2×0.1 = 0.20 mol, so OH– is limiting forming 0.20 mol H2O. Using ΔH°ₙᵤₜ = –57 kJ/mol gives ΔH = –0.20×57 kJ = –11.4 kJ, which converts to –2.72 kcal.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CRTI:
A)

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, convert the enthalpy change to kcal/kJ and compare to the given choices. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent y9o0:
We have ΔH = –11.4 kJ from sub-task 3. Converting to kcal: –11.4 kJ ÷ 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ –2.72 kcal, which matches choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent Y6QE:
Sub-task 3 gave ΔH = –11.4 kJ. Converting to kcal: –11.4 kJ ÷ 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ –2.72 kcal, which matches choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent 6c4U:
Sub-task 3 gave ΔH = –11.4 kJ. Converting to kcal: –11.4 kJ ÷ 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ –2.72 kcal, matching choice A).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, convert the enthalpy change to kcal/kJ and compare to the given choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
