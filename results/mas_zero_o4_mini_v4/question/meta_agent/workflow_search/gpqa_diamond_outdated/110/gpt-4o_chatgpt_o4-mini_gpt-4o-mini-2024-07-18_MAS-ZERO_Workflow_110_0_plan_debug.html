Example(question=&#39;Complete the following reactions and select the major products by considering the steric hindrance, and the stability of the products.\n2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---&gt; A\n1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---&gt; B&#39;, choice1=&#39;A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile&#39;, choice2=&#39;A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile&#39;, choice3=&#39;A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile&#39;, choice4=&#39;A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Analyze the reaction of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK to predict the major product A, considering steric hindrance and stability. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Beou:
The enolate of the sterically hindered ketone adds via Michael addition to ethyl acrylate. The most stable product places the bulky substituents equatorial, giving the 2-oxo isomer rather than 4-oxo. Thus product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (choice 2).

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Beou:
ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate

### Sub-task 2: Based on previous attempts, refine the prediction of product B by considering steric hindrance and stability. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 93Gu:
Considering the Michael addition of the nitronate anion from 1-nitropropane to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, the chain extends to six carbons. Attack occurs at the β-carbon, placing the nitro group at C4 and the original α-methyl at C3 upon protonation. This arrangement minimizes steric hindrance and yields the most stable product.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 93Gu:
3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, match the predicted products A and B to the given choices and determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
