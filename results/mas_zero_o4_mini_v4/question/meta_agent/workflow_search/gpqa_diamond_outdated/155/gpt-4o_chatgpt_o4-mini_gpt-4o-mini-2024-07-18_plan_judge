Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The reaction of (E)- around oct-4-ene yields a racemic trans diol (two enantiomers) and (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a meso diol. On a chiral HPLC column the enantiomeric pair resolves into two distinct peaks while the meso diol appears as a single peak, giving a total of three peaks.

Answer:3 peaks
Extracted answer: 3 peaks
Correct answer: 2
