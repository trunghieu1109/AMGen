Two methyl peaks at δ 21.3 and 28.4 match the two singlets seen in 1H NMR. The strong downfield signal at δ 197.7 indicates a carbonyl (ketone). Four sets of aromatic carbons appear: δ 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene; the remaining aromatic/quaternary carbons at δ 141.5 and 144.1 are the substituted ring carbons.
