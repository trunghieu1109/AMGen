This leads to a continuous energy distribution for the electrons. The maximum energy (endpoint Q) is fixed by the total mass–energy difference between initial and final nuclei minus the rest masses of all emitted particles; it occurs when the neutrinos carry zero kinetic energy and the electrons take the maximum.; answer: The electron spectrum is continuous because in a multi-body decay the available energy is shared in infinitely many ways among the electrons and neutrinos. The endpoint Q is given by energy conservation: Q = 2M_A – 2M_B – 2m_E – 2m_V, i.e. the mass difference between initial and final nucleons minus the rest masses of the emitted electrons and neutrinos (with Q realized when the neutrinos carry no kinetic energy).\nCoT agent V7Ak, on analyzing variant decay process, thinking: Replacing two neutrinos with a single massless particle still leaves a three–body decay (2E + M) so the summed‐electron energy spectrum remains continuous.  However the kinematic phase‐space changes (fewer final‐state particles), so the shape of the distribution is altered.  Energy conservation now gives the maximum electron energy Q′=2M_A–2M_B–2m_E–m_M, which for m_M=0 is larger than the original Q by 2m_V.  Hence the endpoint energy increases.; answer: The electron spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nCritic agent BiCz, feedback: The analysis correctly notes that replacing two neutrinos with one massless particle yields a three-body decay, preserving the continuous electron spectrum but altering its phase-space shape. The endpoint energy increases since fewer particles carry away energy.; correct: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nCoT agent V7Ak, on refining variant decay process, thinking: Replacing two neutrinos with a single massless particle yields a three‐body final state, so the electrons still share energy continuously but with a modified phase‐space distribution. With only one particle taking the remainder energy, the maximal summed‐electron energy increases.; answer: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nCritic agent BiCz, feedback: The analysis incorrectly states that the endpoint increases. In fact, with only one massless particle replacing two neutrinos, momentum-conservation constraints tighten and the maximum summed-electron energy (the endpoint) decreases, even though the spectrum remains continuous with a modified shape.; correct: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.\nCoT agent V7Ak, on refining variant decay process, thinking: Replacing two neutrinos with one massless particle yields a three-body final state, so the summed-electron energy spectrum remains continuous. The phase-space distribution is altered (fewer particles share the energy), and because the single massless particle can carry zero kinetic energy at the endpoint, the maximum summed-electron energy increases compared to the original decay.; answer: C)\nCritic agent BiCz, feedback: The analysis correctly notes that replacing the two neutrinos with one massless particle leaves a three-body final state, so the summed-electron energy spectrum remains continuous, and the endpoint increases because the massless particle can carry zero energy at the endpoint. The reasoning is sound.; correct: C)\nCoT agent V7Ak, on refining variant decay process, thinking: Replacing two neutrinos with one massless particle still yields a three-body final state, so the summed-electron energy remains continuously distributed.
