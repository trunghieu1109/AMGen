I will summarize the key conditions for validity.; answer: The Mott–Gurney equation J=(9/8)ε μ V²/L³ holds under the following assumptions and conditions:\n1. Trap-free material: there are no significant charge traps in the bulk, so all injected carriers contribute to space charge.\n2. Single-carrier conduction: only one type of charge carrier (electron or hole) dominates; the opposite carriers are negligible.\n3. Ohmic injecting contact: the electrode injects carriers freely with negligible injection barrier; contact resistance is low.\n4. Drift-dominated transport: carrier motion is controlled by the electric field; diffusion current is negligible relative to drift.\n5. Steady-state and uniform field: the current and field distribution have reached steady values; the film thickness L and dielectric constant ε are uniform.\n6. No significant recombination: injected carriers do not recombine in a way that alters the space-charge distribution.\nUnder these conditions, the injected space charge limits the current, yielding the quadratic V² dependence and L⁻³ scaling of the Mott–Gurney law.\nCoT-SC agent TQ0l, analyzing statements, thinking: I compared each statement against the core Mott–Gurney assumptions: trap-free bulk, single-carrier transport, Ohmic (barrier-free) injection, and drift-dominated (negligible diffusion) current. Statement A satisfies all; B incorrectly states negligible drift; C involves two carriers; D specifies a Schottky contact (barrier).; answer: A) valid; B) invalid; C) invalid; D) invalid.\nCoT-SC agent 4jjA, analyzing statements, thinking: We check each statement against assumptions: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic injection (no barrier), drift-dominated (negligible diffusion), no recombination. A matches all: true. B says negligible drift: contradicts drift-dominated: false. C has two carriers: false. D has Schottky contact: barrier breaches Ohmic: false.; answer: A) True\nB) False\nC) False\nD) False\nCoT-SC agent uVPd, analyzing statements, thinking: We compare each choice against the known assumptions: trap-free bulk, single-carrier conduction, Ohmic injecting contact (no barrier), drift-dominated transport (negligible diffusion), steady state, uniform field, no recombination.; answer: A) Valid. Matches trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic), negligible diffusion (drift-dominated).\nB) Invalid. “Negligible drift current” contradicts drift-dominated assumption; diffusion cannot dominate.\nC) Invalid. Requires single-carrier conduction; two-carrier devices violate assumption.\nD) Invalid. Schottky contact implies injection barrier; violates Ohmic contact requirement.\nDebate agent DRmr, debating statement validity, thinking: Based on the Mott–Gurney assumptions—trap‐free bulk, single‐carrier transport, Ohmic contact, and drift‐dominated current—only statement A meets all criteria.; answer: A)\nDebate agent ssRv, debating statement validity, thinking: Based on sub-task 2, only statement A meets all Mott–Gurney assumptions: trap-free bulk, single-carrier, Ohmic contact (no injection barrier), and drift-dominated transport (negligible diffusion).; answer: A)\nDebate agent PabD, debating statement validity, thinking: The Mott–Gurney equation requires trap-free single-carrier transport, barrier-free (Ohmic) injection, and drift-dominated current.
