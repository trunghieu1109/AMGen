    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.&#39;, choice1=&#39;18.475 GeV&#39;, choice2=&#39;20.132 GeV&#39;, choice3=&#39;23.069 GeV&#39;, choice4=&#39;21.419&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus X at 0.96c using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent qohW:
Using the Li-6 atomic mass from sub-task 1 (6.015122794 u), we subtract 3 electrons (0.00164574 u) to get the nuclear mass ≈6.013477054 u (1 u=931.4941 MeV/c²). Thus m₀c²≈5601.52 MeV. With γ=1/√(1−0.96²)=3.5714286, E=γm₀c²≈3.5714286×5601.52 MeV≈20004.7 MeV≈20.0047 GeV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent qohW:
The relativistic energy of the Li-6 nucleus at 0.96c is approximately 20.0047 GeV.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, compare the calculated energy with the given choices and select the closest match with a precision of 1e-4.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
