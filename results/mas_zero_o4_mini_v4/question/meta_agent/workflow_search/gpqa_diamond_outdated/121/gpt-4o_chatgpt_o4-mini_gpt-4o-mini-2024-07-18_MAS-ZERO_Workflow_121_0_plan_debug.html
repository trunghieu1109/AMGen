    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)&#39;, choice1=&#39;12&#39;, choice2=&#39;10&#39;, choice3=&#39;5&#39;, choice4=&#39;8&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output from sub-task 4, determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent acfy:
The dialkylated symmetric product EtO2C–CH(CN)–(CH2)5–CH(CN)–CO2Et has these distinct 1H environments: ethyl CH3 (1), ethyl OCH2 (1), methine CH(CN) (1), two diastereotopic CH2 α to each stereocenter (2), two diastereotopic CH2 β (2), and the central CH2 (1), totaling 8 signals.

### thinking by Debate Agent LTOg:
The final dialkylated product EtO2C–CH(CN)–(CH2)5–CH(CN)–CO2Et is symmetric. Proton environments: ethyl CH3; ethyl OCH2; two equivalent methine CH(CN); two diastereotopic CH2 adjacent to each methine (giving two distinct signals); and the central CH2. Total distinct 1H NMR signals = 8.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1yYk:
The final product is symmetric di-ester with a pentamethylene linker. Distinct 1H environments: ethyl CH3, ethyl OCH2, two equivalent CH(CN) methine, two sets of diastereotopic CH2 next to stereocenters, and the central CH2, totaling 8 distinct signals.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Based on the output from sub-task 4, determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
