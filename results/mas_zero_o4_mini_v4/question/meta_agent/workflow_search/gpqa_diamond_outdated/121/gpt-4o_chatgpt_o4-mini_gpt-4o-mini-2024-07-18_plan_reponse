            "acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)",
