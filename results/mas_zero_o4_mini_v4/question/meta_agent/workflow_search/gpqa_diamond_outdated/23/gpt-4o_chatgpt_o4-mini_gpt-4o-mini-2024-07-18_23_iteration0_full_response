There is enough information to describe why it decolorizes bromine water (addition to C=C or C≡C bonds) and what happens with Pt-catalyzed heating (disproportionation between two unsaturated molecules). No detailed molecular formulas are required for this sub-task, so a complete answer can be given without additional requests.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent nOed:\nMixture X consists of two non-conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes or alkynes). Because each contains a C=C or C≡C bond, they rapidly add bromine, decolorizing bromine water. When heated with a platinum catalyst, the two unsaturated molecules undergo a disproportionation reaction: one molecule is hydrogenated to a saturated hydrocarbon, while the other is dehydrogenated to an unsaturated hydrocarbon. This produces mixture Y, which no longer decolorizes bromine water.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, evaluate the properties and reactions of mixture Y, including why it does not decolorize bromine water. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KWrQ:\nMixture Y forms via disproportionation of two unsaturated hydrocarbons: one is fully hydrogenated (cyclohexane) and the other is dehydrogenated to benzene. Neither benzene (due to its aromatic stabilization) nor cyclohexane (saturated) can add bromine under normal conditions, so Y does not decolorize bromine water. Under severe Pt‐catalyzed hydrogenation, benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane; cyclohexane remains unchanged, so only cyclohexane (Z) is formed.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent KWrQ:\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. It does not decolorize bromine water because benzene (aromatic) and cyclohexane (saturated) lack reactive C=C or C≡C bonds. Upon Pt‐catalyzed hydrogenation, benzene is converted to cyclohexane and cyclohexane remains unchanged, yielding only hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane).\n\n### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, identify substance Z using the given mass fraction of hydrogen and its properties. \n\n ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent a5ay:\nSub-task 2 established that mixture Y is benzene and cyclohexane. Hydrogenation converts benzene (C6H6) to cyclohexane (C6H12) while cyclohexane remains unchanged, yielding only cyclohexane. Its molecular formula C6H12 gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 12/(6×12+12)=12/84≈14.28%, it is a common solvent, and it does not undergo further hydrogenation under Pt catalysis. These properties match substance Z.\n\n### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent a5ay:\ncyclohexane\n\n### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. \n\n ### thinking by Debate Agent yeSQ:\nMixture X contains two C6 hydrocarbons whose disproportionation yields benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12).

No detailed molecular formulas are required for this sub-task, so a complete answer can be given without additional requests.; answer: Mixture X consists of two non-conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes or alkynes). Because each contains a C=C or C≡C bond, they rapidly add bromine, decolorizing bromine water. When heated with a platinum catalyst, the two unsaturated molecules undergo a disproportionation reaction: one molecule is hydrogenated to a saturated hydrocarbon, while the other is dehydrogenated to an unsaturated hydrocarbon. This produces mixture Y, which no longer decolorizes bromine water.\nCoT-SC agent KWrQ, on the purpose of evaluating mixture Y, thinking: Mixture Y forms via disproportionation of two unsaturated hydrocarbons: one is fully hydrogenated (cyclohexane) and the other is dehydrogenated to benzene. Neither benzene (due to its aromatic stabilization) nor cyclohexane (saturated) can add bromine under normal conditions, so Y does not decolorize bromine water. Under severe Pt‐catalyzed hydrogenation, benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane; cyclohexane remains unchanged, so only cyclohexane (Z) is formed.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. It does not decolorize bromine water because benzene (aromatic) and cyclohexane (saturated) lack reactive C=C or C≡C bonds. Upon Pt‐catalyzed hydrogenation, benzene is converted to cyclohexane and cyclohexane remains unchanged, yielding only hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane).\nCoT-SC agent mGv8, on the purpose of evaluating mixture Y, thinking: From sub-task 1 we know mixture X comprises non‐conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbons that add Br2. Pt‐catalyzed disproportionation of these yields one molecule hydrogenated (alkane) and one dehydrogenated (aromatic) per pair. The resulting mixture Y must contain no C=C or C≡C bonds free to add Br2, so it’s a mix of saturated cyclohexane and aromatic benzene. Neither cyclohexane nor benzene decolorizes bromine water. Under severe hydrogenation both convert to cyclohexane (Z).; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. It does not decolorize bromine water because benzene undergoes only electrophilic substitution (not addition) and cyclohexane is fully saturated.\nCoT-SC agent 8mJu, on the purpose of evaluating mixture Y, thinking: Mixture Y forms by Pt-catalyzed disproportionation of cyclohexene: one molecule is dehydrogenated to benzene (aromatic), the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (fully saturated). Both have no C=C bonds that react with bromine under dark, so bromine water stays colored. Aromatics resist addition without a catalyst, and alkanes are inert to bromine water.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Neither decolorizes bromine water because cyclohexane has no C=C bonds and benzene does not add Br2 under these conditions.\nCoT agent a5ay, on the purpose of identifying substance Z, thinking: Given that mixture Y is benzene and cyclohexane, and both hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane while cyclohexane remains unchanged, the sole product Z is cyclohexane. Checking its formula C6H12 gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 12/(6×12+12)=12/84≈14.28%. Cyclohexane is also a common solvent and does not react further with hydrogen under Pt catalysis.; answer: cyclohexane\nCritic agent X9bZ, on the purpose of reviewing substance Z, thinking: The identification of cyclohexane as substance Z is correct. Its formula C6H12 yields a hydrogen mass fraction of 12/(6×12+12)=12/84≈14.28%, it is a common solvent, does not decolorize bromine, and is unreactive toward further hydrogenation under Pt catalysis.; answer: cyclohexane\nCoT agent a5ay, on the purpose of refining substance Z, thinking: Substance Z must be the sole product of hydrogenating an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Benzene (C6H6) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12) and cyclohexane remains unchanged under Pt catalysis. The mass fraction of hydrogen in C6H12 is 12/(6×12+12)=12/84≈14.28%, matching the given value. Cyclohexane is a common solvent and does not react further with hydrogen under these conditions, confirming the identification.; answer: cyclohexane\nCritic agent X9bZ, on the purpose of reviewing substance Z, thinking: The identification of Z as cyclohexane is correct, since its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% and it is the sole product of hydrogenating both mixtures. However, the reasoning is flawed: it incorrectly assumes mixture X is benzene + cyclohexane and that benzene decolorizes bromine water. In reality, mixture X contains unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., cyclohexadienes) that decolorize Br2, and mixture Y is benzene + cyclohexane. The confusion between mixtures X and Y led to the mistaken rationale, even though the final identification of Z is right.; answer: cyclohexane\nCoT agent a5ay, on the purpose of refining substance Z, thinking: Sub-task 2 established that mixture Y is benzene and cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane. Its formula C6H12 gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 12/(6×12+12)=12/84≈14.28%. Cyclohexane is a common solvent and unreactive under further Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation, matching all criteria for Z.; answer: cyclohexane\nCritic agent X9bZ, on the purpose of reviewing substance Z, thinking: The identification of Z as cyclohexane is correct. Its formula C6H12 gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 12/(6×12+12)=12/84≈14.28%, it is a component of mixture Y, serves as a common solvent, and does not undergo further hydrogenation under the conditions described.; answer: cyclohexane\nCoT agent a5ay, on the purpose of refining substance Z, thinking: Sub-task 2 established that mixture Y is benzene and cyclohexane.

The donor loses H2 to form C6H6, so it is C6H8; the acceptor gains H2 to form C6H12, so it is C6H10. Thus the two liquids are C6H8 and C6H10, with 8+10=18 hydrogen atoms.; answer: 18\nDebate agent w2TS, round 0, on the purpose of calculating hydrogen atoms, thinking: Mixture Y is benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Disproportionation of equimolar X to Y involves one component losing H2 (A: C6H8 → C6H6) and the other gaining H2 (B: C6H10 → C6H12).
