proposed answer: Red phosphorus and HI reduce aromatic carboxylic acids by radical decarboxylation (Ar–COOH → Ar–H). Starting from 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, loss of CO₂ and H• gives sec-butylbenzene.

Answer:The reaction proceeds by radical decarboxylation of the carboxyl group under RP/HI to give sec-butylbenzene (1-sec-butylbenzene).
Extracted answer: The reaction proceeds by radical decarboxylation of the carboxyl group under RP/HI to give sec-butylbenzene (1-sec-butylbenzene).
Correct answer: 0
