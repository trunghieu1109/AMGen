    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?&#39;, choice1=&#39;28&#39;, choice2=&#39;40&#39;, choice3=&#39;68&#39;, choice4=&#39;54&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the current probability of particles reaching the detector walls based on the given Lorentz factor (~20) and the fraction (one third) provided. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent sMMl:
The problem states that on average one third of the particles reach the detector walls, so the probability is directly 1/3.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent sMMl:
Approximately 33.3%

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine the required Lorentz factor that results in about two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector walls.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We assume survival probability P=exp(-R/(γcτ0)). Given P1=1/3 at γ1=20 leads to R/(cτ0)=20ln3. For P2=2/3, solve exp(-20ln3/γ)=2/3 ⇒ γ=20ln3/(ln3−ln2)≈54.2. Nearest choice is 54.
