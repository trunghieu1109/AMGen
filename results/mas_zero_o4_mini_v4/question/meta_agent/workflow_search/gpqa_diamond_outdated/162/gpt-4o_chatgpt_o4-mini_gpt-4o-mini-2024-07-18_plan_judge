Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The pH calculation requires the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ and the stepwise hydrolysis (acid dissociation) constants for Fe³⁺. Those equilibrium constants are not provided, so the final [H⁺] and pH cannot be determined.

Answer:pH cannot be determined with the given data.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)₃ and the hydrolysis (acid dissociation) constants for Fe³⁺ to calculate the final pH.
Extracted answer: pH cannot be determined with the given data.
