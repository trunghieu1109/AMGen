Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 132_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Using the initial concentrations of H2PO4– and HPO4^2– from sub-task 3, apply Henderson–Hasselbalch with pKa2 to find pH ≈7.091, then calculate [PO4^3–] = Ka3·[HPO4^2–]/[H+] = (1.8×10^-12·0.02809)/(8.11×10^-8) ≈6.24×10^-7 M.

Answer:6.24×10^-7 M
Extracted answer: 6.24×10^-7 M
Correct answer: 1
