proposed answer: All debate agents agree that ozonolysis with oxidative workup cleaves the α,β‐unsaturated cyclopentenone to give an eight-carbon chain with two ketones at C5 and C6, methyls at C3 and C4, and a terminal carboxylic acid, matching 3,4-dimethyl-5,6-dioxooctanoic acid.

Answer:3,4-dimethyl-5,6-dioxooctanoic acid
Extracted answer: 3,4-dimethyl-5,6-dioxooctanoic acid
Correct answer: 1
