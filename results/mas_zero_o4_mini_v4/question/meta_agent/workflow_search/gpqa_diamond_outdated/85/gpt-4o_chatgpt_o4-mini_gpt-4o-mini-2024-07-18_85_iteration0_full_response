Hence the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.; answer: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nCoT-SC agent FPU0, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome for compound B, thinking: The intramolecular complex between BH3 and the isobutoxy oxygen directs syn hydride delivery to the carbonyl, and because B is the (R)-acid, the new stereocenter is formed with S configuration, giving (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.; answer: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nCoT-SC agent lnFF, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome for compound B, thinking: The sub-task asks for the stereochemical outcome of B + BH3 + H+ giving (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Borane reduction of a carboxylic acid proceeds via a cyclic borane intermediate delivering hydride syn from the less hindered face; the stereocenter in the starting acid is retained in the product lactone, giving the S configuration.; answer: The reaction proceeds with syn hydride delivery from BH3, retaining the configuration at the stereocenter and yielding the (S)-enantiomer.\nDebate agent qWNF, on the purpose of selecting starting materials, thinking: Sub-task 1 gives (R) product from LiBH4 reduction requiring starting acid A to be the S-acid; Sub-task 2 gives (S) product from BH3 reduction requiring starting acid B to be the R-acid; this matches choice A.; answer: A)\nDebate agent Heca, on the purpose of selecting starting materials, thinking: From sub-task 1, A must be the (S)-acid to give (R)-lactone with LiBH4.
