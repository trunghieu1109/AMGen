Peaks at same wavelength ⇒ same T, so T1/T2=1. Thus L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2=(1.5)^2=2.25.; answer: 2.25\nCoT agent fa1z, on the purpose of analyzing wavelength impact, thinking: Given both stars peak at the same wavelength, they share the same temperature. In the Stefan–Boltzmann law, L∝R²T⁴, identical T makes T⁴ cancel when forming the ratio, so only R² matters.; answer: Since the stars have the same temperature, the T⁴ factor cancels in L₁/L₂, leaving L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²=(1.5)²=2.25. Thus the equal wavelength (temperature) means the luminosity ratio depends solely on the square of the radius ratio.\nCritic agent K95N, on the purpose of providing feedback, feedback: Having the same peak wavelength means both stars have the same temperature, so in the Stefan–Boltzmann law (L∝R²T⁴) the T⁴ terms cancel when taking the ratio. Thus the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio.; correct: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\nCoT agent fa1z, on the purpose of refining wavelength impact, thinking: Since both stars peak at the same wavelength, they must have the same surface temperature. In the Stefan–Boltzmann law L∝R²T⁴, identical T means the T⁴ factors cancel when forming the ratio L₁/L₂, leaving only the radius term.; answer: Since the stars have the same temperature, the T⁴ factors cancel in the luminosity ratio, giving L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²=(1.5)²=2.25.\nDebate agent zzAI, round 0, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: Radial motions introduce Doppler shifts in the observed peak wavelength (and hence inferred T) and in the flux. For v/c≈0.0023 the resulting correction to L∝T⁴ (and to bolometric flux) is of order a few ×10⁻³, so the impact on L₁/L₂ is ≲1%.; answer: The Doppler effect from 700 km/s changes the luminosity ratio by <1%, so L₁/L₂ remains ≈2.25.\nDebate agent p81u, round 0, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The radial velocity of Star_2 (700\u2009km/s ⇒ β≈0.00233) causes a Doppler redshift of its peak wavelength: λ_obs=λ_emit(1+β), so its intrinsic temperature T2_intrinsic=T_obs(1+β)^{-1}. Thus L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2_intrinsic)^4 =2.25/(1.00233^4)≈2.23.; answer: D)\nDebate agent GOEk, round 0, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: Radial velocities introduce relativistic Doppler shifts that can affect both the observed temperature (via wavelength redshift) and the observed flux (via energy and arrival‐rate changes). Without clear instruction on which relativistic corrections (e.g. Doppler dimming of bolometric flux or correction to surface temperature from redshifted peak wavelength) to apply, the adjustment to L₁/L₂ can only be estimated (~0.4–0.5%).; answer: Luminosity ratio remains approximately 2.25, with the 700 km/s radial velocity of Star_2 reducing its observed flux by ≈0.5%, yielding L₁/L₂≈2.26.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify which relativistic Doppler corrections (flux dimming, temperature redshift, beaming effects, etc.) should be applied to refine the luminosity‐ratio calculation.\nDebate agent NPKG, round 0, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The radial velocities lead to Doppler boosting/dimming of the observed flux by a factor D^3≈(1±v/c)^3. At v=700\u2009km/s (v/c≈0.0023), the correction to L₂ is of order 3v/c≈0.7%, so L₁/L₂ remains ≈2.25 within ≲1% uncertainty.; answer: The Doppler effect on luminosity is negligible (<1%), so the luminosity ratio remains ≈2.25.\nDebate agent zzAI, round 1, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: Radial velocity of Star_2 (v≈700 km/s, β≈0.00233) Doppler-redshifts its peak wavelength and dimming its flux by ∼(1+β)^{-4} in temperature and ∼(1+β)^{-3} in flux, giving L₁/L₂≈2.25/(1.00233^4)≈2.23 (a ≲1% correction).; answer: 2.23\nDebate agent p81u, round 1, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The 700 km/s redshift (β≈0.00233) lowers the inferred T₂ by a factor (1+β)⁻¹, so in L∝R²T⁴ the ratio becomes 2.25/(1.00233)⁴≈2.23.; answer: ≈2.23\nDebate agent GOEk, round 1, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The radial velocity of Star_2 (700 km/s → β≈0.00233) induces a Doppler redshift in its observed temperature and a slight flux dimming (∼3β for bolometric flux). Both effects together reduce L₂ slightly, increasing the ratio L₁/L₂ only by a few ×10⁻³. Numerically, L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂_intrinsic)⁴≈2.25/(1.00233)⁴≈2.23.; answer: The Doppler shift and bolometric flux correction from Star_2’s radial velocity lower the ratio from 2.25 to about 2.23.\nDebate agent NPKG, round 1, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: Radial velocity of Star_2 (700 km/s, β≈0.00233) causes a Doppler redshift and a flux dimming of order (1+β)^{-1} and D^3≈(1−β)^3 respectively. Both effects together reduce the inferred luminosity of Star_2 by ≲1%, so the original ratio 2.25 is lowered slightly to about 2.23.; answer: L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.23\nDebate agent zzAI, round 2, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The radial velocity of Star_2 (700 km/s ⇒ β≈0.00233) Doppler‐redshifts its spectrum and dims its bolometric flux by ∼(1+β)^{-4}. Applying L₁/L₂=2.25/(1.00233)⁴ gives ≈2.23.; answer: Based on the radial velocities, the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.23\nDebate agent p81u, round 2, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The Doppler shift from Star_2’s radial velocity (v≈700 km/s, β≈0.00233) redshifts its observed temperature and dims its flux by a factor ≈(1+β)⁻⁴. Applying this correction to L∝R²T⁴ reduces the ratio from 2.25 to 2.25/(1.00233)⁴≈2.23.; answer: Including the Doppler-induced dimming of Star_2 yields L₁/L₂ ≈2.23\nDebate agent GOEk, round 2, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: The radial velocity of Star_2 (700 km/s ⇒ β≈0.00233) causes a slight Doppler redshift and flux dimming, reducing its inferred temperature by (1+β)⁻¹ and its bolometric flux by ≈(1+β)⁻³. Hence in L∝R²T⁴ the ratio becomes 2.25/(1.00233)⁴ ≈2.23.; answer: ≈2.23\nDebate agent NPKG, round 2, on the purpose of considering radial velocities, thinking: A radial velocity of 700 km/s corresponds to β≈0.00233. Doppler shifting reduces the inferred temperature by (1+β)^{-1} and the bolometric flux by ~(1+β)^{-3}, so the luminosity of Star_2 is underestimated by ≲1%.
