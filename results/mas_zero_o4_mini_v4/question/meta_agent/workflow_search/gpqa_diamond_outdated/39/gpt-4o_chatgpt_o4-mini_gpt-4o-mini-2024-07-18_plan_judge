Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=1)
