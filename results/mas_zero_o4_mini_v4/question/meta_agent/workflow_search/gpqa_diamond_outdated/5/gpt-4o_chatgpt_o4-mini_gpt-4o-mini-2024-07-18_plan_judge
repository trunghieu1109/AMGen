Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 5_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Both agents agree that the potential corresponds to an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m), leading to energy eigenvalues E = ℏ[ω_x(n_x+½) + ω_y(n_y+½)] which simplifies accordingly.

Answer:E = ℏ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)
Extracted answer: E = ℏ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2)
Correct answer: 0
