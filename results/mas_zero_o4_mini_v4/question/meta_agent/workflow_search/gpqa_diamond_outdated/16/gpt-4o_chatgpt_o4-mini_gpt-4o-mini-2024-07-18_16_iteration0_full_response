The equilibrium constant expression relates the concentration of the complex to the product of the free ion concentrations.; answer: Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} ⇌ CaEDTA^{2-}\nK_{Ca-EDTA} = [CaEDTA^{2-}]/([Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}])\nCoT agent RtOd, on calcium ion concentration calculation, thinking: We have the equilibrium Ca2+ + EDTA4– ⇌ CaEDTA2– with K = [CaEDTA2–]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]). With 0.02 M complex and negligible free EDTA, we set [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–] = x.

Starting with [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M and assuming [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, the expression K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) gives x² = 0.02 / (5×10¹⁰) = 4×10⁻¹³, so x = √(4×10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M.; correct: 6.3×10⁻⁷ M\nCoT agent RtOd, on calcium ion concentration refinement, thinking: Using the equilibrium expression K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4-]), set [Ca2+] = [EDTA4-] = x and [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M.
