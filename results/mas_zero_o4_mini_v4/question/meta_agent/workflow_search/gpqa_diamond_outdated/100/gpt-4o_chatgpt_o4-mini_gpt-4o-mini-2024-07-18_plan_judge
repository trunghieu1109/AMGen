Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 100_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The reaction is an acid-catalyzed imine formation between 3-methylpyrrolidine and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, with TsOH as the catalyst. This corresponds to choice 2, which is option B).
