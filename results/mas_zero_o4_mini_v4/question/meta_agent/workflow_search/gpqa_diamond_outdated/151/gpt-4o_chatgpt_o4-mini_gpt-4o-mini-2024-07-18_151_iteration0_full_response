When applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it activates the pheromone signaling pathway, causing cell cycle arrest in G1 and inducing polarization of the cytoskeleton, leading to shmoo formation (the mating projection) and associated transcriptional changes.\nCoT-SC agent zW7g, exploring chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, thinking: The sub-task asks what types of protein complexes are typically identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS). These include factors directly bound to active chromatin—histone complexes, transcription pre-initiation complexes, enhancer-associated complexes, mediator/co-activators, polymerase subunits, chromatin remodelers, etc.—whereas replication-origin complexes (pre-replication complexes) are not enriched in assays targeting active transcriptional regions.; answer: ChIP-MS of active chromatin typically recovers: 1) Nucleosome histone complexes (core histones and variants) 2) Pre-initiation complexes (TBP, TFIID, TFIIH, RNA Pol II subunits) 3) Enhancer-associated complexes (co-activators, pioneer factors, mediator) 4) Chromatin remodelers and cohesion/CTCF complexes  \nThe pre-replication complex (origin recognition complex, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM proteins) is least likely to be observed when profiling actively transcribed chromatin.\nCoT-SC agent Uw21, exploring chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, thinking: The sub-task asks for an overview of the types of protein complexes typically identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. ChIP-MS cross-links DNA and its bound proteins, immunoprecipitates with a target antibody, then uses MS to identify co-precipitated factors. Typical hits include core histones, nucleosome remodelers, general transcription machinery, coactivators, and sequence-specific factors.; answer: ChIP-MS of active chromatin typically identifies: 1. Nucleosome/histone complexes (core histones and their variants) 2. Chromatin remodelers (e.g. SWI/SNF, ISWI) 3. Histone modifiers and readers (e.g. HATs, HDACs, bromodomain proteins) 4. General transcription factors/pre-initiation complex (TBP, TFIIA–H, Mediator) 5. Coactivator complexes (e.g. SAGA, Mediator) 6. Sequence-specific transcription factors (activators at enhancers) 7. Histone chaperones (e.g. FACT) 8. Cohesin and architectural proteins (e.g. CTCF in higher eukaryotes)\nCoT-SC agent 9FEn, exploring chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation isolates DNA-bound proteins, so active chromatin regions will be enriched for histones, transcription initiation factors (pre-initiation complex), and enhancer‐binding proteins. Pre‐replication complexes load at origins in S phase and are not present on active promoters in G1‐arrested shmoo cells, so those proteins will be least recovered.; answer: Proteins from the pre-replication complex will be the least observed in the ChIP-MS assay of active chromatin in the shmoo.\nDebate agent aNNZ, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin will enrich for histones, transcription initiation factors, enhancer-bound complexes, but not pre-replication complexes which assemble at origins during DNA replication, not active transcription. Therefore the least likely complex is the pre-replication complex.; answer: B)\nDebate agent UcKz, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin will enrich for histone complexes, transcription pre-initiation complexes, enhancer-associated proteins, mediator/coactivators, and RNA polymerase subunits bound at active genes. Pre-replication complexes assemble at replication origins before S phase and are not associated with active transcription, so they will be least observed in a ChIP-MS assay targeting active chromatin.; answer: B)\nDebate agent rghj, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin recovers transcription‐associated proteins (nucleosomes, enhancer factors, pre-initiation complexes) but not replication origin complexes, so the pre-replication complex is least likely.; answer: B)\nDebate agent oDLq, round 0, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: ChIP-MS on active chromatin will pull down transcription-related complexes (pre-initiation, enhancer-associated, histone/nucleosome) but not DNA replication origin complexes, so the pre-replication complex is least likely observed.; answer: B)\nDebate agent aNNZ, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: ChIP–MS on active yeast chromatin enriches for histone/nucleosome complexes, transcription pre-initiation factors, and enhancer-bound coactivators, but not DNA replication origin complexes (pre-replication complexes) which assemble outside of active transcription regions.; answer: B)\nDebate agent UcKz, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: ChIP-MS of active chromatin enriches transcription-associated proteins such as nucleosomes, histone complexes, pre-initiation complexes and enhancer proteins, but not pre-replication complexes which assemble at origins during S phase and are absent in active transcriptional regions.; answer: B)\nDebate agent rghj, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin enriches for transcription‐associated proteins (nucleosome histones, enhancer‐bound factors, pre‐initiation complexes) but not replication origin factors, which assemble before S phase and are not on active transcription sites.; answer: Likely observed: pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex; least likely complex: pre-replication complex.\nDebate agent oDLq, round 1, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: ChIP-MS of active chromatin enriches transcription-related complexes such as pre-initiation complexes, enhancer proteins, and nucleosome histones, but not replication origin complexes which assemble at origins during S phase and are not associated with active transcription.; answer: B)\nDebate agent aNNZ, round 2, on determining the least likely protein complex, thinking: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active, transcriptionally engaged chromatin will enrich for histone/nucleosome complexes, transcription pre-initiation complexes, and enhancer‐associated factors.
