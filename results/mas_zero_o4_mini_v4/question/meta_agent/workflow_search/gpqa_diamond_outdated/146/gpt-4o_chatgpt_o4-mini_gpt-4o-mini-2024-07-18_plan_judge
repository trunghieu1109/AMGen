Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Total annihilation energy is 2m_pc² = 2×938 MeV = 1876 MeV, shared equally by 4 A particles gives E_A = 469 MeV. Then γ = E_A/(m_A c²) = 469/300 ≈ 1.563, and β = √(1–1/γ²) ≈ 0.77, so v ≈ 0.77c.
