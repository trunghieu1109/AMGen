Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Using the inclination derived from the first planet's impact parameter (b1=0.2) and the occultation condition (i ≥ arccos[(R*−Rp2)/a2]), we find a2_max ≈ 0.224 AU. Applying Kepler’s third law with M*≈1.5 M⊙ gives P2_max ≈ 33.5 days.
