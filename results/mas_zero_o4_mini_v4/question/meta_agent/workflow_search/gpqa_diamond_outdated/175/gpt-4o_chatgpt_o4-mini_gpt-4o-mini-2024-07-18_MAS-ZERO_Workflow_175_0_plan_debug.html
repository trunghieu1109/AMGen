    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?&#39;, choice1=&#39;1/2&#39;, choice2=&#39;1/6&#39;, choice3=&#39;1/3&#39;, choice4=&#39;2/3&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-tasks 1 and 3, calculate the joint probability of obtaining 0 for P and -1 for Q. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent tW1Y:
The joint probability equals P(P=0)×P(Q=−1|P=0)=1/3×1/2=1/6, which corresponds to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent HEYR:
The joint probability is P(P=0)×P(Q=−1|P=0)=1/3×1/2=1/6, which corresponds to choice B).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-tasks 1 and 3, calculate the joint probability of obtaining 0 for P and -1 for Q.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
