This enolate attacks benzaldehyde to give, upon acidification, the β-hydroxy ketone: a cyclohexanone bearing at C2 a –CH(OH)Ph substituent.; answer: 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one\nCoT agent z379, on the purpose of determining product 2, thinking: Diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) selectively replaces the secondary alcohol in 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one with fluorine via an SN2‐type deoxofluorination, yielding the β‐fluoro ketone.; answer: 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one\nCritic agent dZ2j, on the purpose of verifying product 2, feedback: The predicted fluorinated ketone skeleton is correct—DAST converts the β-hydroxy ketone to a β-fluoro ketone. However, DAST proceeds via SN2 at the former alcohol center, inverting its configuration. Thus the complete product is (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one (choice 1), and stereochemistry must be specified.; correct: no\nCoT agent z379, on the purpose of refining product 2, thinking: DAST effects deoxofluorination of the β‐hydroxy ketone via an SN2 mechanism, inverting the stereochemistry at the former alcohol center. This yields (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one, corresponding to choice A).; answer: A)\nCritic agent dZ2j, on the purpose of verifying product 2, feedback: The proposed product A is incorrect. With excess DAST, both the β-hydroxy group and the ketone are converted to fluorides: the ketone gives a geminal difluoride at C1, and the former alcohol is replaced by fluoride with inversion at C2. Thus product 2 is the 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl derivative bearing a fluoromethylphenyl substituent, namely ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene.; correct: ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene\nCoT agent z379, on the purpose of refining product 2, thinking: With excess DAST, both the ketone and the β-alcohol are converted: the ketone yields a geminal difluoride at C1, and the secondary alcohol at C2 is replaced by fluoride via SN2 inversion. This matches choice 2.; answer: B)\nCritic agent dZ2j, on the purpose of verifying product 2, feedback: The predicted product 2 structure is correct.
