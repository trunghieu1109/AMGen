Here f_r(r)=1/r^2, so r^2 f_r =1, whose r-derivative is zero for r≠0.; answer: ∇·f = (1/r^2) d/dr[r^2·(1/r^2)] = (1/r^2) d/dr[1] = 0 for r≠0.\nReflexion CoT agent ObjF, initial integration, thinking: Since ∇·f=0 for all r≠0, integrating 0 over the sphere’s volume gives 0.; answer: 0\nCritic agent LpT3, feedback on integration, thinking: The result 0 is incorrect.
