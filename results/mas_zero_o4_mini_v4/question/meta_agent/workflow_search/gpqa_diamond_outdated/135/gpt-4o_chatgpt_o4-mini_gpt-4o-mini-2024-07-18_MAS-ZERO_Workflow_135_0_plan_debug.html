    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?&#39;, choice1=&#39;1&#39;, choice2=&#39;4 π&#39;, choice3=&#39;0&#39;, choice4=&#39;4/3 π R &#39;, correct_index=1).
