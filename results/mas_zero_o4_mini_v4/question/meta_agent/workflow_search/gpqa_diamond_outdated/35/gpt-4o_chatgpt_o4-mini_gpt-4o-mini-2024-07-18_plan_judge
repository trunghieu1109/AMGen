Question: Example(question='Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?', choice1='Cold molecular interstellar medium.', choice2='Cold atomic interstellar medium.', choice3='Warm atomic interstellar medium.', choice4='Warm molecular interstellar medium.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 35_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The 3.9 μeV line is the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, which in the Milky Way primarily traces the cold atomic (H I) interstellar medium.
