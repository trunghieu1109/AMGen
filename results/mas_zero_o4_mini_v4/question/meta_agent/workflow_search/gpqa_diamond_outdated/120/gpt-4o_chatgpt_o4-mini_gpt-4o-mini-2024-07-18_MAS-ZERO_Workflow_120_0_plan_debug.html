    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:&#39;, choice1=&#39;(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol&#39;, choice2=&#39;(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, choice3=&#39;(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, choice4=&#39;(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol &#39;, correct_index=2).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-tasks 1 and 2, identify the correct product from the given choices by analyzing the stereochemistry and structure. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent uLEB:
Organocuprate opens the epoxide via SN2 at the less hindered carbon, inverting its configuration. Mapping substituents gives (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which is choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent L4zb:
Organocuprate Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via SN2 inversion of configuration at that center. Mapping the substituents onto the cyclohexanol framework gives (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent 07Yj:
The organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, inverting that center’s configuration. Mapping the substituents onto the cyclohexanol product aligns with choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent AU11:
Organocuprate Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, inverting its configuration. Mapping substituents onto the cyclohexanol framework yields the (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol product, corresponding to choice B).
