This is straightforward and doesn’t require additional info, so no [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: The reaction begins when the dialkylcuprate (Me₂CuLi) coordinates to the oxygen of the epoxide, increasing the electrophilicity of the ring carbons. The cuprate acts as a soft nucleophile and undergoes an SN2‐type attack at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. This preferential attack is governed by steric factors (less crowded carbon is more accessible) and by the soft–soft interaction between the Cu–C bond and the C–O bond.\n\nMechanistic steps:\n1. Coordination: The oxygen of the epoxide donates its lone pair to copper, forming a transient complex and polarizing the C–O bonds.\n2. Nucleophilic attack: The methyl group bound to copper attacks the less hindered carbon from the backside, opening the three‐membered ring in an SN2 fashion.\n3. Inversion of configuration: Because it’s an SN2 attack, the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon inverts.\n4. Work‐up: Protonation of the alkoxide intermediate during aqueous work‐up yields the corresponding alcohol.\n\nOverall, Me₂CuLi ring‐opens the epoxide at the less substituted carbon with inversion at that center, giving a β‐alkoxyalkylcuprate that upon protonation furnishes the alcohol.\nCoT agent O1KN, on the purpose of determining stereochemical outcome, thinking: Organocuprate attacks the less hindered carbon in an SN2 fashion, so that center undergoes inversion of configuration.; answer: The nucleophile attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration at that carbon (e.g., R → S or S → R).\nCritic agent DFPq, on the purpose of providing feedback, feedback: The answer correctly identifies that the organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration at that center.; correct: Yes\nCoT agent O1KN, on the purpose of refining stereochemical outcome, thinking: Organocuprate-mediated ring opening of epoxides proceeds via an SN2 attack at the less hindered carbon, which necessarily inverts the stereochemistry at that center.; answer: The nucleophile attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration (R → S or S → R) at that carbon.\nCritic agent DFPq, on the purpose of providing feedback, feedback: The explanation is correct. Organocuprate reagents open epoxides at the less hindered carbon via an SN2‐type attack, which inverts the configuration at the attacked center.; correct: Yes\nCoT agent O1KN, on the purpose of refining stereochemical outcome, thinking: Organocuprate-mediated epoxide opening proceeds via SN2 attack at the less hindered carbon, which always inverts configuration at the attacked center.; answer: The nucleophile attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration (R → S or S → R) at that carbon.\nCritic agent DFPq, on the purpose of providing feedback, feedback: The answer correctly identifies that organocuprate-mediated epoxide opening proceeds by an SN2 attack at the less hindered carbon, leading to inversion of configuration at that center.; correct: The nucleophile attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration (R ↔ S) at that carbon.\nCoT agent O1KN, on the purpose of refining stereochemical outcome, thinking: Organocuprate reagents open epoxides via an SN2‐type attack at the less hindered carbon, which by definition inverts the stereochemistry at the attacked center.; answer: The nucleophile attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon via an SN2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration (R → S or S → R) at that carbon.\nDebate agent uLEB, round 0, on the purpose of identifying correct product, thinking: The organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon via SN2, inverting its configuration.
