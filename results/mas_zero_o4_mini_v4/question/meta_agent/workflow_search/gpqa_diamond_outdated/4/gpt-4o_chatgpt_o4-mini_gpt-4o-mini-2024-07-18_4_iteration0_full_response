Writing n=(n_x,0,n_z), we get P=n⋅P=n_xP_x+n_zP_z. Substituting the Pauli‐matrix forms gives P=(ħ/2)(n_xσ_x+n_zσ_z), or as a matrix P=(ħ/2)[[n_z, n_x];[n_x, −n_z]].; answer: P = n⋅P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) = (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, −n_z]]\nCoT-SC agent fldN, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: We have P=(ħ/2)[[n_z,n_x];[n_x,−n_z]] with n_x=sinθ,n_z=cosθ. Solving (n_xσ_x+n_zσ_z)ψ=+ψ yields eigenvector ψ∝(cos(θ/2),sin(θ/2)), which is normalized.; answer: Eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nCoT-SC agent kLLR, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: We solve (n_xσ_x + n_zσ_z)v = v which gives tan χ = n_x/(1 + n_z) = tan(θ/2), so up to normalization v = (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).; answer: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nCoT-SC agent Fr2v, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: We have P=(ħ/2)[[n_z,n_x];[n_x,−n_z]] with n_x=sinθ,n_z=cosθ. Solve Mv=v for M=[[cosθ,sinθ],[sinθ,−cosθ]]. From (cosθ−1)v1+sinθ v2=0 ⇒v2/v1=(1−cosθ)/sinθ=tan(θ/2). Normalize to get v=(1, tan(θ/2))/√(1+tan^2(θ/2))=(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).; answer: The normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nCoT agent FTju, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: Compute the norm: |ψ|^2 = cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2) = 1, so the vector is already unit-normalized.; answer: Normalized eigenvector: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nCritic agent 0Ypb, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: The proposed normalized eigenvector (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) already has unit norm since cos²(θ/2)+sin²(θ/2)=1.
