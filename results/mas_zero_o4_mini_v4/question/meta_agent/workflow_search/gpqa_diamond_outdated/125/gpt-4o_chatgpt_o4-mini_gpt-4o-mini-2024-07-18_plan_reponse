            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",
