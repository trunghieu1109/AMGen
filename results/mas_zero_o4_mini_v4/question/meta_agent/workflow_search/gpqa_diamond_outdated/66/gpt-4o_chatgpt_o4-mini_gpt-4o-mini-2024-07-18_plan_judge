Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The coupled state |1,1;2,-1> has total m=m1+m2=-1. Individual m1,m2 can each be −1,0,+1. To get both m1=−1 and m2=−1 would give total m=−2, which is orthogonal to |2,−1>, so the overlap is zero.

Answer:Possible L_{1z},L_{2z} values: m1,m2∈{−1,0,1}. Joint probability for both being −ħ is 0.
Extracted answer: Possible L_{1z},L_{2z} values: m1,m2∈{−1,0,1}. Joint probability for both being −ħ is 0.
Correct answer: 2
