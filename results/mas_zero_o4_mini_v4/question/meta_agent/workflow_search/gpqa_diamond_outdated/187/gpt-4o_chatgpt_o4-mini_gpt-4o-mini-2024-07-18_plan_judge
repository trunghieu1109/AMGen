Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 187_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The interplanar spacing requires the magnitude of the reciprocal‐lattice vector g_{111}=b₁+b₂+b₃, but sub‐task 2’s output (the explicit bᵢ) is missing, so a numerical result cannot be obtained.

Answer:d_{111} = 2π/|b₁ + b₂ + b₃|
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the Cartesian components of the real‐space vectors a₁, a₂, a₃ (or the computed b₁, b₂, b₃) so that |b₁ + b₂ + b₃| can be evaluated exactly.
Extracted answer: d_{111} = 2π/|b₁ + b₂ + b₃|
Correct answer: 0
