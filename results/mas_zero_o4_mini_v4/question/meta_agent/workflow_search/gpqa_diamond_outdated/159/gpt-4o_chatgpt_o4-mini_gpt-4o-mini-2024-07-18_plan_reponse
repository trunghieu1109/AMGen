            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",
