In that limit the N-sided polygon becomes a circle of radius a, whose far-field diffraction is the Airy pattern governed by a Bessel function. This directly leads to the known minima positions.; answer: When N→∞ the polygonal aperture approaches a circular aperture of radius a. Its far-field diffraction is described by the Airy pattern, with intensity I(θ) ∝ [2 J₁(k a sinθ)/(k a sinθ)]² and the first minima determined by the zeros of J₁.\nCoT agent bMS3, on the purpose of deriving formula, thinking: For a circular aperture of radius a, the far-field intensity minima occur at zeros of J₁. The first two zeros are α₁≈3.8317 and α₂≈7.0156. Using the small-angle approximation k a θ ≈ α gives θ = α/(k a) = α λ/(2π a). The angular separation Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (α₂ - α₁)λ/(2π a).; answer: Δθ = (α₂ - α₁) λ/(2π a), where α₁ ≈ 3.8317 and α₂ ≈ 7.0156, hence Δθ ≈ 0.506 λ/a.\nCoT agent OJsx, on the purpose of deriving formula, thinking: For a circular aperture the minima occur at k a sinθ = x_m, where x_1≈3.8317 and x_2≈7.0156 are zeros of J1. Using k=2π/λ and sinθ≈θ gives θ_m = x_m λ/(2π a). The angular separation is Δθ = (x_2−x_1)λ/(2π a).; answer: Δθ = (x_2 − x_1) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a\nCoT agent MXvP, on the purpose of deriving formula, thinking: For a circular aperture, diffraction intensity I(θ) ∝ [2J₁(ka\u2009sinθ)/(ka\u2009sinθ)]². The minima occur where J₁’s argument u = ka\u2009sinθ equals its zeros j₁,1≈3.8317, j₁,2≈7.0156. For small θ, sinθ≈θ, so θ_n = j₁,n\u2009λ/(2πa). Thus the angular separation between first two minima is Δθ = (j₁,2−j₁,1)λ/(2πa). Numerically (7.0156−3.8317)/(2π)≈0.506.; answer: Δθ = (j₁,₂ − j₁,₁) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a\nDebate agent ler2, on the purpose of selecting correct choice, thinking: The derived angular separation Δθ≈0.506 λ/a matches choice4.; answer: D)\nDebate agent FGg7, on the purpose of selecting correct choice, thinking: The derived Δθ ≈0.506 λ/a matches choice4, which corresponds to option D).; answer: D)\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing choice, thinking: The derived angular separation Δθ ≈ 0.506 λ/a matches choice4, corresponding to option D).; answer: D)', iteration_idx=-1)]
