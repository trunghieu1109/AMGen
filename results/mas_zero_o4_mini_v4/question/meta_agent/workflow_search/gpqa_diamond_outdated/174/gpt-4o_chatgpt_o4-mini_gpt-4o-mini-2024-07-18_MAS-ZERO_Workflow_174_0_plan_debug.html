    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, choice1=&#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, choice2=&#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, choice3=&#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, choice4=&#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, match the calculated fraction and function form to one of the given choices. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Fwyv:
From sub-task 1 we have f∝λ⁻⁶ sin²(2θ) and from sub-task 2 the fraction at θ=30° is 3/4. This matches choice2 (3/4, λ⁻⁶), i.e. option B).

### thinking by Debate Agent 1gTF:
From sub-task 1 we have f∝λ⁻⁶ and from sub-task 2 the fraction at θ=30° is 3/4. This matches choice2 (3/4, λ⁻⁶), which is option B).

### thinking by Debate Agent KDWH:
From sub-task 1, f∝λ⁻⁶ sin²(2θ). From sub-task 2, the fraction at θ=30° is 3/4. The choice matching 3/4 and λ⁻⁶ is choice 2, i.e. B).

### answer by Debate Agent Fwyv:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 1gTF:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent KDWH:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make the final decision based on all debates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
