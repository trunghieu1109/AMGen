One uses the standard quadrupole‐radiation formula dP/dΩ=(μ0cω6Q02/(1152π2))\u2009sin2(2θ) and substitutes ω=2πc/λ to get the λ−6 dependence.; answer: The radiated power per unit solid angle is given by the electric‐quadrupole formula\n\n dP/dΩ = (μ0\u2009c\u2009ω6\u2009Q02)/(1152\u2009π2)\n          × sin2(2θ)\n\nwith ω=2πc/λ.
