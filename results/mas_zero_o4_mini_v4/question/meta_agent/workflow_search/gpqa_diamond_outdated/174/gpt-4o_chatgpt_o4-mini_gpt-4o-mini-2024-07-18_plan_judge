Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 174_Iteration_0
proposed answer: All debate agents concluded that the fraction is 3/4 and the functional form is λ⁻⁶, which corresponds to choice 2, i.e., option B).
