Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 41_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Using the refined equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T3≈3.22 gives a3/a1=(T1/T3)²≈10.37, and applying Kepler’s third law P∝a^{3/2} yields P3/P1 ≈10.37^{1.5}≈33.4.

Answer:~ 33.4
Extracted answer: ~ 33.4
Correct answer: 1
