proposed answer: The sulfoxonium ylide undergoes the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction with the α,β-unsaturated ketone Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)Me to form an epoxide at the former carbonyl and adds one CH₂ unit. The starting ketone has 10 carbons; addition of CH₂ gives 11.

Answer:Product 3 is 2-methyl-3-styryl-oxirane and contains 11 carbon atoms.
Extracted answer: Product 3 is 2-methyl-3-styryl-oxirane and contains 11 carbon atoms.
