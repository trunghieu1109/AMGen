Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 70_Iteration_0
proposed answer: All debate agents agree the calculated temperature ratio (~0.83) corresponds to option B.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
