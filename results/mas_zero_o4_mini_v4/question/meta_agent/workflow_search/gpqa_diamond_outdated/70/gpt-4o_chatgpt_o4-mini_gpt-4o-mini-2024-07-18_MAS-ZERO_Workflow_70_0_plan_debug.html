    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~0.75&#39;, choice2=&#39;~0.83&#39;, choice3=&#39;~0.69&#39;, choice4=&#39;~0.57&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output from sub-task 2, determine which choice (A, B, C, D) corresponds to the calculated ratio. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent zxJu:
The calculated ratio is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent YopD:
The calculated ratio T4/T2 ≈ 0.83 matches choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent 5bSa:
The calculated ratio ≈0.83 matches choice2, which is option B).

### thinking by Debate Agent zVBA:
The calculated temperature ratio is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to choice B).

### answer by Debate Agent zxJu:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent YopD:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 5bSa:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent zVBA:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output from sub-task 2, determine which choice (A, B, C, D) corresponds to the calculated ratio.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
