Key properties follow from the symmetry operators and group order.; answer: Characteristics and properties of the C₃h point group:\n1. Symmetry elements:\n   • E (identity)\n   • C₃ and C₃² (proper rotations by 120° and 240° about the principal axis)\n   • σₕ (mirror plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis)\n   • S₃ and S₃⁵ (improper rotations: rotation by 120° or 240° followed by reflection in σₕ)\n2. Group order: 6 operations in total.\n3. Abelian group: all symmetry operations commute.\n4. Irreducible representations: six one‐dimensional irreps, since it’s abelian (sum of squares of dimensions =6).\n5. Selection rules: molecular vibrations or electronic transitions split into A′ (even under σₕ) and A″ (odd under σₕ) species; no degeneracy beyond 1.\n6. Typical consequences:\n   • No vertical mirror planes (all reflection is in the horizontal plane).\n   • No C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n   • Unique labeling of vibrational modes and orbital symmetries by their parity under σₕ (′ or ″).\nCoT agent gTpr, on the purpose of analyzing molecule symmetry, thinking: Assigned point groups based on molecular geometry and substituent identity: quinuclidine has a threefold axis and three vertical planes (C3v), triisopropyl borate has identical substituents around a threefold axis but no mirror planes through substituents (C3), the benzo-trifuran-hexaone is planar with a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (C3h), and the triphenyleno-trifuran-hexaone inherits the D3h symmetry of the triphenylene core.; answer: quinuclidine: C3v\ntriisopropyl borate: C3\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: C3h\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: D3h\nCoT agent TOTF, on the purpose of analyzing molecule symmetry, thinking: We identify point groups: quinuclidine has only a twofold axis (C2); trialkyl borates are trigonal with threefold axis and vertical planes (C3v); the benzo-trifuran hexanone has C3h (threefold axis plus horizontal mirror); the triphenyleno-trifuran hexanone, being fully planar with D3 symmetry and horizontal plus vertical mirrors, is D3h.; answer: quinuclidine: point group C2 (one C2 axis, no mirror planes)\ntriisopropyl borate: point group C3v (one C3 axis through B, three σv planes containing B and an isopropyl group)\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: point group C3h (one C3 axis perpendicular to molecular plane, one σh plane)\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: point group D3h (one C3 axis, three C2 axes in plane, one σh plus three σv planes)\nCoT agent 1hOh, on the purpose of analyzing molecule symmetry, thinking: To assign point groups we consider molecular geometry and identical substituents.
