Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 95_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Using the Bekenstein–Hawking formula S = 4πkGM^2/(ħc) with M ≈ 1.7×10^34 kg gives S ≈ 10^62 J/K, matching choice 3.
