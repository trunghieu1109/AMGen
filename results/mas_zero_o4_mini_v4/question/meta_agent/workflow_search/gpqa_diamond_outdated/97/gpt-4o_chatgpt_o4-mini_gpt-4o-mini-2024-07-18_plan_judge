Question: Example(question='Identify the starting material, A, in the following reaction.\nA + a methyleneruthenium compound + 1-propene ---> 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane', choice1='2-methyl-3-methylenebicyclo[2.1.0]pentane', choice2='bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-6-ene', choice3='1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane', choice4='2-methylbicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Evaluate each option for having two exocyclic methylenes on a cyclopentane ring to allow selective cross‚Äêmetathesis at one site. Choice1 and 4 are bicyclic frameworks, not simple dimethylenecyclopentane. Choice2 lacks exocyclic methylenes. Only Choice3 (1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane) fits the requirement.
