            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",

The luciferase assay measures ATP (mitochondrial output), Mito-RTP imaging visualizes mitochondria, and the cationic dye flow cytometry measures membrane potential. Only the glucose uptake colorimetric assay assesses cytosolic glucose transport/metabolism, not a direct mitochondrial parameter.\n\nAnswer:C)",
