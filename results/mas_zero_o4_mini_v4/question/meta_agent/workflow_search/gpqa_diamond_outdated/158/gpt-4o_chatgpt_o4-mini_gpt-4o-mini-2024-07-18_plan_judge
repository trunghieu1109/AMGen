Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Compute the comoving distance using D_C = c ∫₀^z dz'/H(z') for z≈5.5 in flat ΛCDM (H₀=70, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7) yields D_C ≃7.9 Gpc, rounding to 8 Gpc.
