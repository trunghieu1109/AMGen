Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 73_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Using λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹ and the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, P(decay in next 150 min | survived 50 min) = 1 − exp(−λ·150) ≈ 1 − exp(−0.579) ≈ 0.44.
