    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, choice1=&#39;52%&#39;, choice2=&#39;48%&#39;, choice3=&#39;44%&#39;, choice4=&#39;40%&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Calculate the decay rate from the given probability of 32% within 100 minutes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent FEtQ:
We have P(decay in 100 min)=1−e^{−λ·100}=0.32 ⇒ e^{−100λ}=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386 min⁻¹.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent FEtQ:
Decay constant λ≈0.00386 min⁻¹

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xahL (yourself):
Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution: P(decay in next 150 min | survived 50 min) = 1 – exp(–λ·150) with λ≈0.00386 min⁻¹ gives ≈1 – exp(–0.579) ≈0.440.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xahL (yourself):
C)

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, review the calculation for decay probability in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 5mTm:
The calculation correctly uses the memoryless property of the exponential distribution: λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹, so P = 1 - exp(-0.00386·150) ≈ 44%.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xahL (yourself):
Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution: P(decay in next 150 min | survived 50 min) = 1 − exp(−λ·150) with λ ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹ gives ≈ 1 − exp(−0.579) ≈ 0.44.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xahL (yourself):
C)

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, review the calculation for decay probability in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent 5mTm:
The calculation is correct. Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.00386 min⁻¹, so P=1−exp(−λ·150)≈1−exp(−0.579)≈0.44 (44%).

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xahL (yourself):
Using the memoryless property of the exponential distribution: P(decay in next 150 min | survived 50 min) = 1 − exp(-λ·150) with λ ≈ -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹ gives ≈ 1 − exp(-0.579) ≈ 0.44.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xahL (yourself):
C)

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, review the calculation for decay probability in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent 5mTm:
The calculation correctly applies the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. With λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00386 min⁻¹, we get P = 1 − exp(−0.00386·150) ≈ 44%.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, given no decay in the first 50 minutes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
