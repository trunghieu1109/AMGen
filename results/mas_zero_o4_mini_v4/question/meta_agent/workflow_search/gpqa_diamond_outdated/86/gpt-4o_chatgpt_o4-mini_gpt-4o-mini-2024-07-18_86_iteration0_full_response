The aromatic AA'BB' splitting (2 doublets) indicates para substitution. Thus it is para-haloacetophenone, most commonly p-chloroacetophenone.; answer: p-Chloroacetophenone\nCoT-SC agent KWRV, on the purpose of analyzing FTIR data, thinking: For p-chloroacetophenone, IR should show a strong C=O stretch in the 1650–1750 cm⁻¹ region and C–Cl stretching in the fingerprint region around 700–800 cm⁻¹. Aromatic C–H stretches (~3030 cm⁻¹) and C=C stretches (~1600, 1500 cm⁻¹) further support the benzene ring.; answer: Strong sharp band around 1680 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) confirms the carbonyl; a band near 750 cm⁻¹ indicates the aromatic C–Cl stretch, confirming the halogen bond on the ring.\nCoT-SC agent aGvm, on the purpose of analyzing FTIR data, thinking: The carbonyl stretch appears as a strong sharp absorption around 1680–1700 cm⁻¹, and aromatic C–Cl bending vibrations give characteristic bands in the 600–800 cm⁻¹ region (often near 750 cm⁻¹). These confirm the presence of both the C=O and the aromatic–halogen bond.; answer: FTIR shows a strong sharp band at ~1685 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) and medium bands around 750 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C–Cl bend), confirming both the carbonyl and aromatic–halogen bond.\nCoT-SC agent 5mll, on the purpose of analyzing FTIR data, thinking: To confirm the functional groups in p-chloroacetophenone, we look for characteristic IR absorptions: a strong, sharp C=O stretch around 1680–1715 cm⁻¹ for an aromatic ketone, and C–Cl stretching bands in the fingerprint region around 700–800 cm⁻¹. These are well-established IR markers for a carbonyl and an aromatic halogen.; answer: The FTIR spectrum should show:\n• A strong, sharp absorption near 1680–1715 cm⁻¹, confirming the aromatic ketone C=O stretch.\n• One or more bands in the 700–800 cm⁻¹ region, characteristic of the C–Cl stretch in a para-chlorobenzene ring.\nCoT agent 46aO, on the purpose of determining expected 1H NMR data, thinking: The compound is p-chloroacetophenone.
