    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.&#39;, choice1=&#39;29&#39;, choice2=&#39;25&#39;, choice3=&#39;35&#39;, choice4=&#39;31&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify Substance X and determine its constituent elements, focusing on the heavier isotope and its role in reactions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ww6x:
The reaction profile (violent reaction with water releasing D2 gas, formation of Al(OD)3 precipitate which on heating yields D2O melting near 277 K) and the note about an organic‐chemistry reagent point to lithium aluminum deuteride, the deuterated analog of LiAlH4. 

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ww6x:
Substance X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4), composed of lithium, aluminum, and the heavy hydrogen isotope deuterium, which serves as the hydride (deuteride) donor in reductions and releases D2 gas upon hydrolysis.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, analyze the reaction between Substance X and liquid Y, focusing on the release of gas W and formation of precipitate G. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6btC:
Substance X is LiAlD4. It reacts with liquid Y (D2O) by exchanging deuteride for deuteron, liberating D2 gas and forming aluminum deuteroxide as a precipitate.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6btC:
LiAlD4 + 4 D2O → LiOD (aq) + Al(OD)3 (s) + 4 D2↑; gas W is D2 and precipitate G is Al(OD)3, which upon heating releases D2O.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the properties of gas W, focusing on the number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 57s1:
All debate agents agree gas W is D2, with each deuteron containing one proton and one neutron, so the molecule has two of each.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 57s1:
Gas W is molecular deuterium (D2), containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons per molecule.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, investigate the properties of precipitate G and its decomposition to release B, including determining the melting point of B. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent DQ9N:
Precipitate G from LiAlD4 hydrolysis is Al(OD)3. Heating Al(OD)3 drives off heavy water, D2O. The literature melting point of D2O under normal pressure is 276.97 K, matching the ~277 K referenced.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent DQ9N:
Precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)3). Upon heating, it decomposes to yield heavy water (D2O), which melts at approximately 276.97 K (≈277 K).

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, analyze the reaction of a keto acid with Substance X to determine the resulting product containing 2 atoms of oxygen. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BQak:
Substance X is LiAlD4. It will reduce the carboxyl of a keto acid (e.g. pyruvic acid) to a primary alcohol while leaving the ketone intact, delivering D. Thus pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH) gives CH3COCH2OD, which contains two oxygens.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent BQak:
CH3COCH2OD

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Based on the output of sub-task 5, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X, considering all isotopes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
