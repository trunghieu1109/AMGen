Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 9_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Based on sub-tasks 1–4, the computed densities are: Earth ≃5.51 g/cm³; 2 M⊕ planet ≃6.3 g/cm³; 5 M⊕ Earth-composition planet ≃7.5 g/cm³; 0.5 M⊕ planet ≃4.8 g/cm³. The 5 M⊕ Earth-composition planet has the highest density.
