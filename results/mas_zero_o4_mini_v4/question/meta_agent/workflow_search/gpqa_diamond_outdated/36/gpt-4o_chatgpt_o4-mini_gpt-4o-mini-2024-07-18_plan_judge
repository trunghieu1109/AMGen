Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 36_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The product is (C2H5)2C=C(C2H5)2, a symmetrical tetrasubstituted alkene. The two sp2 carbons are equivalent (1 signal), and all four ethyl groups are equivalent, giving one CH2 signal and one CH3 signal. Total = 3.

Answer:There are 3 distinct 13C-NMR signals for the final product E.
Extracted answer: There are 3 distinct 13C-NMR signals for the final product E.
