Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 72_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Both debate agents agree that the computed relative speed 0.14c and total energy 5.96 m c² match choice A. Therefore, the correct answer is A).
