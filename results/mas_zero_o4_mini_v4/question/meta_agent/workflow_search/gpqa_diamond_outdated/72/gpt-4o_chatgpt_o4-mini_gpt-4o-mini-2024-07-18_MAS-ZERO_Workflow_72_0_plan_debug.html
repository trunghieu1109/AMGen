Example(question=&#39;Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?&#39;, choice1=&#39;v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2&#39;, choice2=&#39;v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2&#39;, choice3=&#39;v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2&#39;, choice4=&#39;v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2&#39;, correct_index=0). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, compare the calculated values with the answer choices and determine the correct one. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent vBzG:
The calculated relative speed 0.14c and total energy 5.96 m c² match choice 1 (A).

### thinking by Debate Agent ze89:
We compare the computed values v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc² against the choices. Only choice A) matches both values.

### answer by Debate Agent vBzG:
A)

### answer by Debate Agent ze89:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make the final decision based on all debates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
