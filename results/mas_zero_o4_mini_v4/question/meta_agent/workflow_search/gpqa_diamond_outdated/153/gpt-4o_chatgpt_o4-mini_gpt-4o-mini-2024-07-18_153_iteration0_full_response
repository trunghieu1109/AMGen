The aromatic C–H stretches would appear just above 3000 cm⁻¹, consistent with an aromatic ring.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent PPMU:\nThe broad 3500–2700 cm^-1 band is characteristic of O–H stretching in carboxylic acids, and the sharp 1720 cm^-1 peak corresponds to a C=O stretch of a carbonyl, specifically a carboxylic acid rather than an aldehyde or ketone.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zMCN:\nThe IR data indicate a carboxylic acid functional group (broad O–H stretch at 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ and sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3xAX:\nIR data indicate a carboxylic acid functional group (broad O–H stretch at 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ and strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹) and an aromatic ring.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent cvdO:\nThe IR data indicate a carboxylic acid functional group (broad O–H and sharp C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹) and an aromatic ring.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent PPMU:\nCarboxylic acid functional group (broad O–H and sharp C=O), plus aromatic ring indications.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, integrate all spectral data to make a final structural suggestion for the unidentified compound.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent rs18, on mass spectrometry data analysis, thinking: The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at m/z 158 in a ~3:1 ratio, which is diagnostic for a single chlorine atom.
