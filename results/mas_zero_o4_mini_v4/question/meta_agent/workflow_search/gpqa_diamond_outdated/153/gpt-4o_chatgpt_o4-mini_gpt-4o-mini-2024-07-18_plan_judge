Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: The molecular formula C7H5ClO2 (M+ at 156, M+2 at 158 in 3:1 ratio) indicates one Cl. IR shows a broad O–H stretch (3500–2700 cm⁻¹) and a sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carboxylic acid. 1H NMR shows a carboxylic acid OH at 11.0 ppm and an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern (two doublets, 2H each) indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene. These data match 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
