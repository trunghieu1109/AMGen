If you are absolutely sure it is correct, output exactly \'True\' in \'correct\'. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent pVwc:\nThe error is the assumed observable cutoff wavelength. The agent used λ_obs≈4000 Å (giving z≈2.29) and thus picked 2.4. In reality optical ground telescopes reach down to ≈3500 Å (or even ≈3200 Å), which yields a redshift lower limit of z≈(3500/1216)–1≈1.88, so the correct choice is 1.9.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.

The question is straightforward physics, so no [TOO_HARD] tag is needed.; answer: Redshift z describes how much the wavelength of light from a distant object is stretched by the expansion of the universe (or Doppler motion). It is defined as z = (λ_obs – λ_emit)/λ_emit, where λ_emit is the emitted (rest‐frame) wavelength and λ_obs is the observed (redshifted) wavelength. Equivalently, λ_obs = λ_emit × (1 + z). A larger z means the light has been stretched to longer (redder) wavelengths by a greater factor.\nCoT-SC agent 7i5w, on the purpose of calculating redshift, thinking: To bring Lyman-α (1216 Å) into the optical band we use λ_obs=λ_emit(1+z). Ground-based optics start around 3800–4000 Å, so z_min=(λ_obs/1216)−1 ≃ (4000/1216)−1 ≃2.29.; answer: z ≃2.3\nCoT-SC agent KYfg, on the purpose of calculating redshift, thinking: To shift 1216\u2009Å into the detectable optical window of a ground‐based spectrograph (typically λ_obs ≳3500\u2009Å), use z = (λ_obs/λ_emit) – 1. Taking λ_obs,min≈3500\u2009Å gives z ≈3500/1216 – 1 ≈1.88, so the absorber’s redshift must be ≳1.9.; answer: z ≈ (3500\u2009Å/1216\u2009Å) – 1 ≈ 1.9\nCoT-SC agent D48O, on the purpose of calculating redshift, thinking: We use λ_obs=λ_emit*(1+z) and set λ_obs to the optical cutoff (~3200–4000 Å) to solve for z.; answer: For Lyman-α (1216 Å) to appear above the atmospheric cutoff at ≈3200 Å, z≥3200/1216−1≈1.63; to reach the blue end of the visible (~4000 Å) requires z≥4000/1216−1≈2.29. Hence a practical lower limit is z≳2.0.\nCoT agent NGWH, on the purpose of determining the correct choice, thinking: Using λ_obs=λ_emit(1+z) with λ_obs≈4000\u2009Å gives z≈(4000/1216)−1≈2.29.
