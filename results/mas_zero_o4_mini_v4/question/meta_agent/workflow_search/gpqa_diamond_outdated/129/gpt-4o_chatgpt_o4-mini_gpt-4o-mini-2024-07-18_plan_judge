Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 129_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The earlier solution assumed an optical cutoff at 4000 Å, but many ground‐based telescopes can observe down to ~3500 Å (or even ~3200 Å). Using λ_obs≈3500 Å in z=(λ_obs/1216)−1 gives z≈(3500/1216)−1≈1.88, so the nearest provided lower‐limit choice is 1.9.
