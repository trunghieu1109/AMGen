Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: The interaction energy between q and its image q' is U_int = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). For a grounded conductor the induced charge distribution arises from the ground and the work is half that of assembling the real–image pair, giving U_net = ½ U_int.

Answer:U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)
Extracted answer: U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)
Correct answer: 0
