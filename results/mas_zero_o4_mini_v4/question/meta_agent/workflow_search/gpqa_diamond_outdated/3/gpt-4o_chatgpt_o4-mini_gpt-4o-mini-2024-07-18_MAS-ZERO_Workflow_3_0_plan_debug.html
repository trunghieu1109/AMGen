    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, choice1=&#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, choice2=&#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, choice3=&#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, choice4=&#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, determine how the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect these Maxwell&#39;s equations. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vz4B:
Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero magnetic charge density ρm, modifying Gauss’s law for magnetism. The Ampère–Maxwell law, which relates curl B to electric current and displacement current, does not involve magnetic charge and remains unchanged.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vz4B:
Gauss’s law for magnetism changes to ∇·B = μ₀ ρₘ, while the Ampère–Maxwell law remains ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, match the modified equations to the provided choices and determine the correct option. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 65eB (yourself):
Only Gauss’s law for magnetism is modified by magnetic monopoles (∇·B≠0), while the curl equation (Ampère–Maxwell) remains unchanged. Thus the only changed equation is the one related to the divergence of B.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 65eB (yourself):
A)

### Sub-task 3: Review the answer above and criticize on where it might be wrong. If absolutely correct, output &#39;True&#39; in &#39;correct&#39;. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent UBFY:
The answer is incorrect: in a theory with magnetic monopoles not only does Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) change, but Ampère–Maxwell’s law also acquires a magnetic current term (the curl of B equation is modified).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, match the modified equations to the provided choices and determine the correct option.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
