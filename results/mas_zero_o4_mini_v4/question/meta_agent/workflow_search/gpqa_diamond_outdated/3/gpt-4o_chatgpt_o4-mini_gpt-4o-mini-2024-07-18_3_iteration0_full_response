These are Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) and the Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B).; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0 in absence of monopoles) and the Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t).\nCoT agent Vz4B, Sub-task 2, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero magnetic charge density ρm, modifying Gauss’s law for magnetism. The Ampère–Maxwell law, which relates curl B to electric current and displacement current, does not involve magnetic charge and remains unchanged.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism changes to ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρₘ, while the Ampère–Maxwell law remains ∇×B = μ₀\u2009J + μ₀\u2009ε₀\u2009∂E/∂t.\nCoT agent eAUZ, Sub-task 2, thinking: To include magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism must acquire a source term equal to the magnetic charge density ρ_m. The Ampère–Maxwell law (curl of B) is unaffected by monopoles.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density; the Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t) remains unchanged.\nCoT agent clEh, Sub-task 2, thinking: Sub-task 1 identified the divergence equation ∇·B=0 (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and the curl equation ∇×B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t (Ampère–Maxwell law). Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density term to the divergence equation but does not alter the curl of B.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism is modified to ∇·B=ρm (or ∇·B=μ₀ρm in SI), while the Ampère–Maxwell law remains ∇×B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t.\nCoT agent 65eB, Sub-task 3, thinking: Only Gauss’s law for magnetism is modified by magnetic monopoles (∇·B≠0), while the curl equation (Ampère–Maxwell) remains unchanged.
