Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density ρₘ, modifying Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=μ₀ρₘ), and require a magnetic current term in the curl of B equation (Ampère–Maxwell law). Thus both divergence and curl equations change.
