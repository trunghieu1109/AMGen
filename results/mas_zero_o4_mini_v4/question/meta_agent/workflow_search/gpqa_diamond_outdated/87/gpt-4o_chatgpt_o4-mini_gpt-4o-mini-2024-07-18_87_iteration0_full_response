They contain specialized M cells that sample antigens from the gut lumen and deliver them to underlying antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages then activate naïve T and B lymphocytes within the follicles. This localized immune induction leads to the generation of gut-homing effector cells and IgA-secreting plasma cells, providing a first line of adaptive defense at mucosal surfaces.\nCoT agent a9bL, on genetic variability, thinking: The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of B cells from Peyer’s patches reflects the process of somatic hypermutation occurring during germinal center reactions, leading to affinity maturation of antibodies.; answer: The high variability signifies that B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation in germinal centers, resulting in affinity maturation of the antibody response.\nCritic agent 5ZtY, feedback: The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene reflects ongoing somatic hypermutation within germinal centers, driving affinity maturation of the antibody response.; correct: It signifies that B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation, resulting in affinity maturation of their antibodies.\nCoT agent a9bL, refined thinking: High variability in the variable heavy chain gene of B cells from Peyer’s patches indicates the action of somatic hypermutation during germinal center reactions, which increases antibody affinity through mutation and selection.; answer: The high variability signifies that B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation in germinal centers, resulting in affinity maturation of the antibody response.\nCritic agent 5ZtY, feedback: The answer correctly identifies that high variability in the variable heavy chain gene signifies somatic hypermutation leading to antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers.; correct: High variability indicates ongoing somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation of B cell receptors.\nCoT agent a9bL, refined thinking: The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of B cells from Peyer’s patches indicates that these cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation within germinal centers, which drives affinity maturation of the antibody response.; answer: The high variability signifies that B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation in germinal centers, resulting in affinity maturation of the antibody response.\nCritic agent 5ZtY, feedback: The explanation correctly links high variability to somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation in germinal centers.; correct: High variability in the variable heavy chain gene indicates that B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation within germinal centers, driving affinity maturation of the antibody response.\nCoT agent a9bL, refined thinking: High variability in the variable heavy chain region reflects the accumulation of mutations during germinal center reactions.
