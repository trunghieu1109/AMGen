proposed answer: All agents consistently identified sequence A as matching the required steps: NaNH2/methyl chloride for alkylation, H2/Pdâ€“CaCO3 for selective partial hydrogenation, O3/(CH3)2S for ozonolysis to aldehydes, and Ba(OH)2 for intramolecular aldol to yield the target secondary alcohol.
