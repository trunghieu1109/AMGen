Given c=1, the speed is 1/n.; answer: The speed of light in the medium is 1/n.\nCoT agent cXsv, on the purpose of incorporating medium velocity, thinking: The speed in the moving medium is found by relativistic addition of the medium’s velocity v and the light’s speed in the medium u'=1/n: u=(u'-v)/(1-u'v), which simplifies to (1-n*v)/(n+v).; answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nCritic agent Gp5k, on the purpose of feedback on velocity effects, thinking: The medium’s velocity enters via relativistic velocity addition. In the medium’s rest frame light travels at u′=1/n. Transforming to the lab frame where the medium moves at v in the beam’s direction gives u=(u′−v)/(1−u′v) which simplifies to (1−n v)/(n+v). Hence a positive v (medium moving along with the beam) further reduces the light’s speed, while motion opposite the beam (v<0) increases it.; answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nCoT agent cXsv, on the purpose of refining velocity effects, thinking: We apply relativistic velocity addition to combine the light’s speed in the medium (u'=1/n) with the medium’s velocity v in the same direction toward the observer: u=(u'−v)/(1−u'v). Substituting u'=1/n gives (1−n v)/(n+v).; answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nCritic agent Gp5k, on the purpose of feedback on velocity effects, thinking: The feedback: When the glass moves toward the observer at speed v, the observed light speed is higher than its static-in-medium value 1/n because the medium’s motion adds to the light’s velocity via relativistic addition. As v increases, this effect grows, making the observed speed approach c. Mathematically, u=(u′−v)/(1−u′v) with u′=1/n gives u=(1−n v)/(n+v).; answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nCoT agent cXsv, on the purpose of refining velocity effects, thinking: We start from the speed of light in the medium’s rest frame u′=1/n. To find its speed in the lab frame where the medium moves at velocity v in the beam’s direction, we use relativistic velocity addition: u=(u′−v)/(1−u′v). Substituting u′=1/n gives u=(1−n v)/(n+v).; answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nCritic agent Gp5k, on the purpose of feedback on velocity effects, thinking: Because the glass is moving toward the observer at speed v, you must combine the light’s speed in the glass (1/n) with v using the relativistic velocity‐addition formula. This yields u = (u′ − v)/(1 − u′v) = (1 − n v)/(n + v). As v increases, the observed light speed in the lab decreases, reaching zero at v = 1/n and reversing direction for larger v.; answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nCoT agent cXsv, on the purpose of refining velocity effects, thinking: Light in the medium’s rest frame travels at u′=1/n. To find its speed u in the lab frame where the medium moves at velocity v in the beam’s direction, apply the relativistic velocity‐addition formula: u=(u′−v)/(1−u′v). Substituting u′=1/n gives u=(1−n v)/(n+v). This shows that when v>0 (medium moving toward observer) the observed light speed is further reduced compared to 1/n, and for v<0 it is increased, approaching c as |v|→1.; answer: u = (1 - n v)/(n + v)\nDebate agent zsdh, round 0, on the purpose of applying relativistic effects, thinking: Sub-task 1 gives u′=1/n in the medium rest frame.
