Taking the ratio for the same level in two stars gives N*1/N*2=exp[E(1/kT2−1/kT1)]. Setting N*1/N*2=2 yields ln2=E/k(1/T2−1/T1).; answer: N*_1/N*_2=2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)], so ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1) or equivalently ln2=(ΔE/k)(T1−T2)/(T1\u2009T2).\nCoT-SC agent ghDJ, iteration 0, on deriving equation, thinking: Under LTE the ratio of excited populations gives ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1). Given ΔE=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J and k=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J/K, ΔE/k=1, so the temperature relation simplifies accordingly.; answer: ln(2)=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1), and since ΔE/k=1, ln(2)=1/T2−1/T1, equivalently ln(2)=(T1−T2)/(T1\u2009T2).\nCoT-SC agent sx1G, iteration 1, on deriving equation, thinking: Under LTE, the population ratio gives ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1).

Substituting ΔE=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J and k=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J/K gives ln2 = 1/T2 − 1/T1, or equivalently ln2 = (T1 − T2)/(T1\u2009T2).\nCoT-SC agent J5KC, iteration 2, on deriving equation, thinking: Under LTE the ratio of excited level populations gives N*1/N*2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)] = 2, so ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1).
