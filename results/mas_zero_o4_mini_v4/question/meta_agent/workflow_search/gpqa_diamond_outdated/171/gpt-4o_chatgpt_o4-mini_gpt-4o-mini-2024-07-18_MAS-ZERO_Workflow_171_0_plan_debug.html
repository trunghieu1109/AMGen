    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?&#39;, choice1=&#39;ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, evaluate the given choices (A, B, C, D) to determine which equation is correct. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent zcHN:
Under LTE and Boltzmann distribution N*∝exp(−E/kT), the ratio gives ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1). With ΔE/k=1 this simplifies to ln2=(T1−T2)/(T1 T2), matching choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent v36D:
From sub-tasks: ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1) and ΔE/k=1 gives ln2=(T1−T2)/(T1 T2). Matching options: only D) matches.

### thinking by Debate Agent FAQd:
Under LTE and using ΔE/k=1, we get ln2 = 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent sXmH:
Under LTE the Boltzmann distribution gives N*_1/N*_2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)]=2, so ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1). Since ΔE/k=1, ln2=1/T2−1/T1=(T1−T2)/(T1 T2), matching choice D.
