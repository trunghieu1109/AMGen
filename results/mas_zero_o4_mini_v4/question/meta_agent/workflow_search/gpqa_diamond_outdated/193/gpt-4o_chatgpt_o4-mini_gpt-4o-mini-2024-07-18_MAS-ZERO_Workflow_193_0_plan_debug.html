Example(question=&#39;Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)&#39;, choice1=&#39;Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)&#39;, choice2=&#39;Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)&#39;, choice3=&#39;Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)&#39;, choice4=&#39;Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, sum the Boltzmann factors to find the partition function Z. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent zwfN:
Enumerating configurations yields 2 states with E = -3J giving weight e^{3Jβ} and 6 with E = +J giving weight e^{−Jβ}, sum is 2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}.

### thinking by Debate Agent yFd9:
The system has 2 fully aligned states with energy E=−3J each contributing e^{3Jβ} and 6 mixed states with energy E=+J each contributing e^{−Jβ}. Summing these gives Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}, corresponding to choice A.

### thinking by Debate Agent sSXk:
The system has 2 fully aligned states (E=−3J) contributing e^{3Jβ} each and 6 mixed states (E=+J) contributing e^{−Jβ} each. Summing these Boltzmann factors yields Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}.

### thinking by Debate Agent xvkO:
Two fully aligned states have energy E=−3J each with weight e^{3Jβ}, and six mixed states have energy E=+J each with weight e^{−Jβ}. Summing gives Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{−Jβ}, which matches choice A.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, sum the Boltzmann factors to find the partition function Z.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
