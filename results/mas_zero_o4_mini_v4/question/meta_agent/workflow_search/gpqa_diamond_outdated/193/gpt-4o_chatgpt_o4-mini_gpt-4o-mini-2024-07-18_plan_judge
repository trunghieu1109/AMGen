Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: Enumerating all spin configurations: 2 fully aligned states with E = -3J each give Boltzmann factor e^{3Jβ}, and 6 mixed states with E = +J each give e^{-Jβ}. Summing yields Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}.
