Conservation of momentum: initial p=mc(√15−√3) to the right must equal vector sum of photon momenta. Each photon has magnitude pγ=Eγ/c=3 m c. Let their directions make angles ±θ with the horizontal.

Solving 2pγ cosθ = mc(√15−√3) with pγ=3mc gives cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.357 ⇒ θ≈68.9°, so the opening angle 2θ≈137.8°, which rounds to 138°, matching the correct choice.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, calculate the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent 7zfX, on the purpose of calculating initial energy and momentum, thinking: We need to sum the relativistic energies and vector momenta of the electron and positron.
