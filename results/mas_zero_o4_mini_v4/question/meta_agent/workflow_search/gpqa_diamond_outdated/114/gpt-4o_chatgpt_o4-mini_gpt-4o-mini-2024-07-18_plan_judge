Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Each photon makes angle θ with the horizontal satisfying 2pγ cosθ=mc(√15−√3) with pγ=3 mc, so cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.357 ⇒ θ≈68.9°, giving opening angle 2θ≈137.8°≈138°.
