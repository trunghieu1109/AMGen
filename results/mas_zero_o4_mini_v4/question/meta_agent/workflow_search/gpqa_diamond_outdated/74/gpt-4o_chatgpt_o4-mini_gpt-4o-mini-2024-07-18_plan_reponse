            "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine\u00ae, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.",

        "response": "Sub-task 1 established that a full\u2010length HA\u2013GADD45G fusion is required for functional studies. Sub-task 2 identified a premature in\u2010frame UAA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing early termination of translation. This truncation likely triggers nonsense-mediated decay and produces an unstable peptide. Additional factors drawn from the debate outputs include the lack of a flexible linker (exposing nascent chains to proteolysis), suboptimal codon usage or mRNA secondary structures impairing ribosome processivity, and overall mRNA instability reducing expression.\n\nAnswer:The premature in\u2010frame UAA stop codon immediately downstream of the HA epitope aborts translation, producing a truncated, unstable peptide that is rapidly degraded and triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Additional contributors to the lack of detectable overexpression include the absence of a flexible linker (increasing proteolysis of nascent chains), suboptimal codon usage, and inhibitory mRNA secondary structures that impair translation efficiency and mRNA stability.",
