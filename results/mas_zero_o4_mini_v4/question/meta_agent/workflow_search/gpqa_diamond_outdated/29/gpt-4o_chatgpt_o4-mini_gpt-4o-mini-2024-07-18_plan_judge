Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 29_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Emission at ~530 nm corresponds to green light; the complementary color to green on the visible additive color wheel is magenta, so that is the light absorbed.
