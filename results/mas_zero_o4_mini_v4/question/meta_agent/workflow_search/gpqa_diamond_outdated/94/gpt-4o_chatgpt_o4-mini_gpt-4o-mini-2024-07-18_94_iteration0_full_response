One equivalent of mCPBA will give a 1:1 mixture of the two possible epoxides at each alkene.; answer: The products are the two epoxide regioisomers:\n(1) 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one\n(2) 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one\nDebate agent f0S4, thinking: Organocuprate (Me2CuLi) will perform SN2 opening of each epoxide at the less substituted carbon, installing a methyl at that carbon and yielding an alcohol at the adjacent carbon. From the 1,2-epoxide, attack at C1 gives a methyl at C1 and OH at C2. From the 5,6-epoxide, attack at C5 gives a methyl at C5 and OH at C6. Either is valid; we can name one.; answer: One product is 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6,6-pentamethylheptan-4-one.\nDebate agent CA3H, thinking: The epoxide regioisomers from sub-task 1 will undergo ring‐opening by the Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi) at the less substituted carbon. For the 1,2‐epoxide, nucleophilic attack occurs at C1, installing a methyl and placing the OH on C2. Naming gives 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one as one of the products.; answer: 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one\nDebate agent VleB, thinking: Organocuprate opens epoxides at the less substituted carbon to give methyl substitution and an alcohol; this matches choice 3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent uFv1, thinking: The Gilman reagent Me2CuLi will open each epoxide at the less substituted carbon, installing a Me and giving the corresponding secondary alcohol after workup. For example, opening of the 1,2-epoxide at C1 yields a Me substituted at C1 and an OH at C2.; answer: 2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one\nFinal Decision agent, thinking: The Gilman reagent Me2CuLi will open each epoxide at the less substituted carbon, installing a methyl group there and giving the adjacent carbon an OH. Thus from the 1,2-epoxide we obtain 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one, and from the 5,6-epoxide we obtain 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one in roughly a 1:1 ratio.; answer: 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one\nCoT-SC agent kp3A, thinking: Sub-task 2 yielded two products: 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one and 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one. The latter corresponds to choice 4, which is option D.; answer: D)\nCoT-SC agent HACp, thinking: Sub-task 2 predicted two products: 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one and 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one. Among the given choices, only 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one matches (choice 4).; answer: D)\nCoT-SC agent tprL, thinking: The Gilman reagent opens the epoxides at the less substituted carbon, yielding 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one and 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one.
