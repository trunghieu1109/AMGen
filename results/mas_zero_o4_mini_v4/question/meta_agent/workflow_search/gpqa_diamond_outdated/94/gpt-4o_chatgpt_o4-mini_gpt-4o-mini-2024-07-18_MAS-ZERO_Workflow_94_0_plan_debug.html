Example(question=&#39;3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:&#39;, choice1=&#39;4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol&#39;, choice2=&#39;2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol&#39;, choice3=&#39;5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one&#39;, choice4=&#39;6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, analyze the reaction products. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent c8S9:
The Gilman reagent Me2CuLi will open each epoxide at the less substituted carbon, installing a methyl group there and giving the adjacent carbon an OH. Thus from the 1,2-epoxide we obtain 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one, and from the 5,6-epoxide we obtain 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one in roughly a 1:1 ratio.

### answer by Final Decision Agent c8S9:
2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 2, identify and name one product formed by the reaction from the given choices.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
