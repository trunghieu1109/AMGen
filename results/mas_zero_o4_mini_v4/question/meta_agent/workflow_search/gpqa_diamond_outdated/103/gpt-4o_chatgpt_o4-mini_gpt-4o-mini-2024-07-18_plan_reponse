            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5\u2009m\u00c5/7\u2009m\u00c5)^3 \u2248 0.364. Planet #2\u2019s period is therefore \u22480.36\u2009\u00d7 that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer:Planet #2\u2019s orbital period is \u22480.36 times that of planet #1.",
