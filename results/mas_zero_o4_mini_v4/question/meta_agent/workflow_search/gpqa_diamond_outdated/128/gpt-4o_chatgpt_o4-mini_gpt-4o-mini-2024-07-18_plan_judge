Question: Example(question='Identify compound E in the following reaction scheme.\nCompound A, when reacted with HCN, produces compound B.\nCompound B, upon reduction with H2 in the presence of Pd, forms compound C.\nCompound C, upon reaction with HNO2, forms compound D.\nCompound D, upon elimination of an inert gas, forms compound E.\nHints:\na) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\nb) The IR spectrum of compound A exhibits a strong peak at around 1750 cm^-1 whereas, IR spectrum of compound E exhibits strong peak at around 1715 cm^-1.', choice1='4-methylcycloheptan-1-one', choice2='2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one', choice3='2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one', choice4='3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=3)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 128_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Elimination of N₂ triggers a semipinacol/Wolff rearrangement contracting the ring to a cyclobutanone; the IR shift to ~1715 cm⁻¹ matches a cyclobutanone C=O, and only 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one fits the pattern.
