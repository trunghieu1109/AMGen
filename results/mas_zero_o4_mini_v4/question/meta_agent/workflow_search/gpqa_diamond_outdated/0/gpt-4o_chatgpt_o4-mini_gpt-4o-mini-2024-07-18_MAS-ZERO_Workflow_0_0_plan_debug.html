    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, choice2=&#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, choice3=&#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;10^-4 eV&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output from Sub-task 1, compare the calculated energy uncertainties to the given options (A: 10^-9 eV, B: 10^-11 eV, C: 10^-8 eV, D: 10^-4 eV) and determine which one can clearly resolve the states. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent mPTt:
To clearly resolve two states, the energy difference must exceed the larger uncertainty (~3.3×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than this uncertainty, so the states can be resolved.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1pvS:
To clearly resolve both states the energy difference must exceed the larger uncertainty (~3.3×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the options only 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large.

### answer by Debate Agent mPTt:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent 1pvS:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the debate results, determine the final answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
