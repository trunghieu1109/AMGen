            "ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?",

Adding DSG shifts crosslinking toward protein\u2013protein interactions and reduces recovery of those direct binding events. Therefore, the disappearing peaks are at active promoters and enhancers.\n\nAnswer:A)",
