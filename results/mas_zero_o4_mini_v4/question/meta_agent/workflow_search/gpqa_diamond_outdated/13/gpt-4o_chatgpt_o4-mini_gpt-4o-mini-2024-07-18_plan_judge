Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: PFA alone enriches for direct IKAROS–DNA contacts that occur at regulatory elements (active promoters and enhancers). Adding DSG shifts crosslinking toward protein–protein interactions and reduces recovery of those direct binding events. Therefore, the disappearing peaks are at active promoters and enhancers.
