Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 82_Iteration_0
proposed answer: All previous calculations converge on the same robust result. Using 0.001 mol acetate in 0.050 L gives [A⁻]=0.020 M. Kb=Kw/Ka=1.00×10⁻¹⁴/1.85×10⁻⁵≈5.405×10⁻¹⁰. Solve x²/(0.020–x)=5.405×10⁻¹⁰ for [OH⁻]: x≈3.29×10⁻⁶ M. Then pOH=5.482 and pH=14–5.482≈8.518, which rounds to 8.52. Neglecting x in the denominator introduces <0.01 pH unit error and activity coefficients are negligible at this concentration.

Answer:At the equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52
Extracted answer: At the equivalence point, pH ≈ 8.52
Correct answer: 1
