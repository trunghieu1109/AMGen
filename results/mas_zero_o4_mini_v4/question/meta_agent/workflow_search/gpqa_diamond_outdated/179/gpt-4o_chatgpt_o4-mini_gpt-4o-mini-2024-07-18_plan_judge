Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 179_Iteration_0
proposed answer: Including both the 12 central–peripheral interactions and the mutual interactions of the 12 peripheral charges yields a total energy of approximately 2.822×10⁻²⁶ J, matching choice A.
