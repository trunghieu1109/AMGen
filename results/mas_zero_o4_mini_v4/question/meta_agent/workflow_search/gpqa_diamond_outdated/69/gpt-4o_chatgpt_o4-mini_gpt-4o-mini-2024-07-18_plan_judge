Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: No explicit structural or spectroscopic data for E have been provided in prior sub-tasks. All agents converge on a C2v assignment based on an assumed central atom with two identical substituents, yielding a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes. This remains speculative without concrete geometry or connectivity information.

Answer:E likely adopts C2v symmetry with a principal C2 axis and two perpendicular σv planes
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide structural or spectroscopic data (e.g., atom connectivity or 3D geometry) to confirm the precise symmetry elements of E.
Extracted answer: E likely adopts C2v symmetry with a principal C2 axis and two perpendicular σv planes
