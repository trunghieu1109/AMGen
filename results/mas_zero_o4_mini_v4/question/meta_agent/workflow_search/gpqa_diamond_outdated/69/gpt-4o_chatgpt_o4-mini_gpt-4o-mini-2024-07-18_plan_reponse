            "reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?",

All agents converge on a C2v assignment based on an assumed central atom with two identical substituents, yielding a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes. This remains speculative without concrete geometry or connectivity information.\n\nAnswer:E likely adopts C2v symmetry with a principal C2 axis and two perpendicular \u03c3v planes\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide structural or spectroscopic data (e.g., atom connectivity or 3D geometry) to confirm the precise symmetry elements of E.",
