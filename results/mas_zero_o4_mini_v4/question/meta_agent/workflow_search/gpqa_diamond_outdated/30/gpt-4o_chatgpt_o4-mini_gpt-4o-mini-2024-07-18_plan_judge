Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 30_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The sequence yields para-diacetone substituted benzene with a mirror plane and inversion center but no C3 or D2h symmetry. Thus the point group is C2h.
