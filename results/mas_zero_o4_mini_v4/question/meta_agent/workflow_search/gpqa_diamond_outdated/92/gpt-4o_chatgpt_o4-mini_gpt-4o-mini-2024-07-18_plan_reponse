            "\"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n",
            "Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ",
            "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles",
            "The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates",
            "qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ",

        "response": "The qPCR assay shows ideal efficiency (100%), perfect linearity (R\u00b2=1), and the expected slope (\u20133.3), confirming that qPCR is in principle a robust quantitative method. However, the technical replicate variation (up to 0.6\u2009cycles) exceeds the commonly accepted threshold of 0.3\u2009cycles, compromising precision and reliability in this specific run.\n\nAnswer:qPCR is fundamentally suitable for nucleic acid quantification, but the current run\u2019s data are not reliable due to excessive technical replicate variation; precision must be improved before accurate quantification.",
