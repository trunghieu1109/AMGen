    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.&#39;, choice1=&#39;C6H10O2&#39;, choice2=&#39;C6H12O&#39;, choice3=&#39;C6H10O&#39;, choice4=&#39;C6H12O2&#39;, correct_index=0).

### Sub-task 4: Based on the FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry analysis, determine the chemical formula from the options. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 3GRV:
FTIR shows broad O–H (~3000 cm⁻¹), C=O (1700 cm⁻¹), C=C (1650 cm⁻¹); ¹H NMR confirms vinyl protons; MS fragment m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Only C6H10O2 fits a carboxylic acid with an alkene.

### thinking by Debate Agent MOz3:
FTIR shows broad O–H (~3000 cm⁻¹), C=O (1700 cm⁻¹), C=C (1650 cm⁻¹); ¹H NMR confirms vinyl protons; MS m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Only C6H10O2 fits a carboxylic acid with an alkene in a six-carbon skeleton.

### thinking by Debate Agent kkSn:
FTIR shows a broad O–H stretch (~3000 cm⁻¹), C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹, and C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicating a carboxylic acid with an alkene. ¹H NMR confirms vinyl hydrogens. MS fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Only C6H10O2 fits a six-carbon alkene carboxylic acid.

### thinking by Debate Agent G3wT:
FTIR shows broad O–H (~3000 cm⁻¹), C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹ and C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicating a carboxylic acid with an alkene. ¹H NMR confirms vinyl protons. MS fragment m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. The only formula matching a carboxylic acid and alkene among the options is C6H10O2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Final decision on the chemical formula.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
