Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: FTIR shows broad O–H (~3000 cm⁻¹), C=O (~1700 cm⁻¹), C=C (~1650 cm⁻¹); ¹H NMR confirms vinyl hydrogens; MS fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to COOH⁺. Only C6H10O2 matches a six-carbon alkene carboxylic acid.
