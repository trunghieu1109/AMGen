### Sub-task 3: Based on the possible products from Sub-task 2, evaluate the stereochemistry and determine the major product. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 46i5:
Alpha bromination of the tautomerized ketone is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored over electrophilic addition across the alkene or overbromination, yielding the monobrominated ketone as the major product.

### thinking by Debate Agent qXuB:
Tautomerization of the enol to the ketone followed by α‐bromination is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored. Electrophilic addition across the alkene to give a vicinal dibromide is disfavored and over‐bromination to the dibromo ketone is less favorable under these conditions. Thus the major product is the α‐monobrominated ketone.

### thinking by Debate Agent SHUy:
The enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and the acidic α‐position undergoes rapid and favored bromination. Electrophilic addition across the alkene (giving vicinal dibromide) and overbromination are less favorable under these conditions, so the α‐monobrominated ketone predominates.

### thinking by Debate Agent dv2X:
The enol rapidly tautomerizes to the ketone and undergoes α‐bromination at the acidic position. Electrophilic addition across the alkene to give vicinal dibromide or overbromination to a dibromo ketone are less favorable. Thus the α‐monobrominated ketone predominates.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of Sub-task 2, determine the major product.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
