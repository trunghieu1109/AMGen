Under Br2 it tautomerizes to the corresponding ketone and undergoes alpha-halogenation, giving a bromoketone.; answer: Functional groups: alkene (C=C) and enol (OH). Reaction type: enol tautomerization followed by alpha-halogenation (electrophilic bromination).\nCoT-SC agent EgKB, on the purpose of listing possible products, thinking: Enol can tautomerize to ketone then undergo alpha-bromination; the C=C can also undergo electrophilic addition of Br2 giving vicinal dibromide; further bromination at the alpha position of the ketone could yield di‐brominated ketone.; answer: Possible products include: 1) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (alpha-monobrominated ketone), 2) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol (vicinal dibromide from alkene addition), and 3) 2,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (overbrominated ketone).\nCoT-SC agent tftq, on the purpose of listing possible products, thinking: Based on the enol tautomerization to the ketone followed by electrophilic bromination at the α‐position or direct bromine addition across the C=C, one can obtain both monobrominated ketones and vicinal dibromo alcohols as stereoisomeric products.; answer: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone; (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol; (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol; 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\nCoT-SC agent wShx, on the purpose of listing possible products, thinking: The enolic substrate can tautomerize to the ketone and be brominated at the α-position. With 1\u2009equiv Br2 one expects monobromination; with excess Br2 additional α-halogenation could occur, and direct addition across the C=C enol double bond would give vicinal dibromide alcohols.; answer: Possible products:\n1) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (α-monobrominated ketone)\n2) 2,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (α,α-dibrominated ketone) with excess Br2\n3) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclentanol (vicinal addition product)\n4) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclentanol (other vicinal stereoisomer)\nDebate agent 46i5, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Alpha bromination of the ketone tautomer is faster and yields a single product, whereas vicinal dibromides give racemic mixtures and overbromination is less favorable. Thus the monobrominated ketone predominates.; answer: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\nDebate agent qXuB, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Once the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, bromination occurs preferentially at the more acidic α-position rather than across the alkene. Electrophilic addition to the C=C is disfavored under these conditions, so the monobrominated ketone predominates.; answer: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\nDebate agent SHUy, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Alpha bromination of the tautomerized ketone is faster/more favorable than electrophilic addition across the alkene under these conditions, so the major product is the α-monobrominated ketone, corresponding to choice A.; answer: A)\nDebate agent dv2X, round 0, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Enol tautomerization of the alkenol to the ketone followed by electrophilic bromination at the α‐position is kinetically and thermodynamically favored over Br₂ addition across the double bond or overbromination. The vicinal dibromo alcohols require anti addition (giving a racemic mixture of trans diastereomers) and are thus minor, as is 2,2‐dibromo overbromination. Therefore the major product is the monobrominated ketone.; answer: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\nDebate agent 46i5, round 1, on the purpose of evaluating stereochemistry, thinking: Enol tautomerizes to ketone, and bromination occurs preferentially at the acidic α‐position rather than electrophilic addition across the alkene or overbromination.
