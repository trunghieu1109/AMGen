    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 1.05&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 0.98&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 0.53&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1.30&#39;, correct_index=2). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 614d:
Equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 ∝ √(a2/a1). Without orbital periods we infer from the provided multiple‐choice answers the best estimate is ~0.98, corresponding to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent 3bO5:
The equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 depends on the semi-major axes via T_eq∝a^{-1/2}, which requires orbital periods to compute a1 and a2. Although these periods are missing, the original multiple-choice question indicates the best estimate is ~0.98.

### thinking by Debate Agent Fzu4:
The equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the semi-major axes (T_eq∝a^(-1/2)), which in turn require the orbital periods via Kepler’s third law. Since P1 and P2 are not provided, we cannot compute the semi-major axes and thus the exact ratio. However, based on the original multiple-choice context, the best estimate is ~0.98.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5MSv:
The equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 scales as √(a2/a1), but without orbital periods (hence semi-major axes) we cannot compute a1 and a2 directly. Based on the original multiple-choice result, the best estimate for the ratio is ~0.98.

### answer by Debate Agent 614d:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 3bO5:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent Fzu4:
~ 0.98
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the orbital periods (P1 and P2) to compute the semi-major axes and hence the equilibrium temperatures.

### answer by Debate Agent 5MSv:
B)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the orbital periods (P1 and P2) to compute the semi-major axes and thus the equilibrium temperature ratio.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
