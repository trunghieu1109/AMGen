Halogen (Cl) is deactivating by induction but less so. Alkyls (CH3, C2H5) activate, with ethyl slightly stronger than methyl.; answer: 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5\nCoT-SC agent oCee, on reactivity, thinking: Electron-donating substituents (CH3, C2H5) activate the ring and increase reactivity toward electrophilic bromination. Halogens (Cl) are weakly deactivating by induction but still direct ortho/para. Resonance-withdrawing groups (COOH, COOC2H5) deactivate the ring more strongly, and nitro (NO2) is the strongest deactivator. Thus reactivity order from highest to lowest follows activating substituents first, then weakly deactivating, then strongly deactivating.; answer: C6H5-C2H5 > C6H5-CH3 > C6H5-Cl > C6H5-COOH > C6H5-COOC2H5 > C6H5-NO2\nCoT-SC agent mOXL, on reactivity, thinking: Ortho/para‐directors activate the ring (↑ reactivity) while meta‐directors deactivate (↓ reactivity). Alkyl groups (C2H5, CH3) are mild activators > Cl (weak deactivator but o/p‐director) > COOH, COOEt (meta‐deactivators) > NO2 (strongest deactivator).; answer: 5>1>3>6>2>4\nDebate agent ENBe, round 0, on para-isomer yield order, thinking: We know meta-directors (2, 4, 6) give zero para-product so rank lowest by their overall reactivity order 4<6<2; among ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5) we need their para/ortho ratios multiplied by their reactivity (3<1<5). Without exact para percentages this is approximate.; answer: 4<6<2<1<5<3\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the ortho/para regioselectivity ratios for CH3, Cl, and C2H5 substituents to accurately compute the para-isomer weight fractions.\nDebate agent fUHO, round 0, on para-isomer yield order, thinking: Meta-directors (2,4,6) give negligible para-product so rank lowest by reactivity (4<6<2). Ortho/para-directors (1,3,5) give para yields proportional to reactivity (3<1<5). Combining: 6<2<4<5<1<3.; answer: 6<2<4<5<1<3\nDebate agent sBvO, round 0, on para-isomer yield order, thinking: Sub-task 1: CH3, Cl, C2H5 are ortho/para directors; COOEt, NO2, COOH are meta directors. Sub-task 2: Reactivity order 4(NO2)<6(COOH)<2(COOEt)<3(Cl)<1(CH3)<5(C2H5). Less reactive para yield fraction increases with activation. Combining gives 6<2<4<5<1<3, corresponding to choice 3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent ENBe, round 1, on para-isomer yield order, thinking: Meta-directors (NO2, COOH, COOEt) give essentially zero paraproduct; among them the para yield increases as COOH<COOEt<NO2, i.e. 6<2<4. Ortho/para directors give para yields in order CH3<C2H5<Cl, i.e. 1<5<3.

Sub-task 2 orders reactivity: 4<6<2<3<1<5. Combining negligible para yields for meta group arranged by deactivation (6<2<4) and increasing para yields for ortho/para group (5<1<3) gives overall 6<2<4<5<1<3.; answer: 6<2<4<5<1<3\nDebate agent sBvO, round 1, on para-isomer yield order, thinking: Meta-directors (NO2-4, COOH-6, COOEt-2) give effectively zero para-product, ordered by their deactivation (4<6<2). Ortho/para directors (Cl-3, CH3-1, C2H5-5) give para-products in proportion to activation (3<1<5).
