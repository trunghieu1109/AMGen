            "Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.",
            "D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.",
            "F is used for the synthesis of dyes.",
            "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.",
            "C is a flammable gas.",

        "response": "Following the reaction sequence: A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, C is propyne (a flammable gas), D is benzene (gives one singlet in 1H NMR), E is nitrobenzene, F is aniline (used in dye synthesis), G is benzenediazonium chloride, H is phenol (gives violet/purple with FeCl\u2083, not yellow). Hence the incorrect statement is choice3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
