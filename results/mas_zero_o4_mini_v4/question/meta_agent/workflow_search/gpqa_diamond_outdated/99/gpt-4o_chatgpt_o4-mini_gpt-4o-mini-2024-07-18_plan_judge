Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Following the reaction sequence: A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, C is propyne (a flammable gas), D is benzene (gives one singlet in 1H NMR), E is nitrobenzene, F is aniline (used in dye synthesis), G is benzenediazonium chloride, H is phenol (gives violet/purple with FeClâ‚ƒ, not yellow). Hence the incorrect statement is choice3.
