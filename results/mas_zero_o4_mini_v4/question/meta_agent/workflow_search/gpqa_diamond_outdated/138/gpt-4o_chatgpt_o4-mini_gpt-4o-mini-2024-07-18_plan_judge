Question: Example(question='Two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Through the mentioned treatment two different diketones are produced. Select the proper starting materials A and B for the reactions.\nA + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\nB + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione', choice1='A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol', choice2='A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol', choice3='A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one', choice4='A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one', correct_index=3)
