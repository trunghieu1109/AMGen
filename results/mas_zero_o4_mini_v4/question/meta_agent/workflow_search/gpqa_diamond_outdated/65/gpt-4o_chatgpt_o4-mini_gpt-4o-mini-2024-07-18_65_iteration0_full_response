In the SMEFT, operators are constructed as combinations of Standard Model fields and their derivatives; to maintain consistency with special relativity, each operator must form a Lorentz scalar. Violating Lorentz invariance would break fundamental features of the theory (e.g., different inertial observers would disagree on physical predictions). Therefore all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.; answer: Yes. Lorentz symmetry must be respected by every operator in the SMEFT.\nCoT agent iMkA, on the purpose of analyzing Poincare symmetry, thinking: Poincaré symmetry (the group of translations plus Lorentz transformations) underlies any relativistic quantum field theory in flat spacetime. In the SMEFT, which is formulated as an expansion around the Standard Model respecting special relativity, all higher-dimensional operators must still transform covariantly under Poincaré transformations. Violating it would break energy–momentum conservation or Lorentz invariance, both of which are foundational to the EFT framework.; answer: Poincaré symmetry is the combination of spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations. It is a fundamental symmetry of any relativistic quantum field theory in Minkowski space, ensuring energy–momentum conservation and Lorentz covariance. In the SMEFT, despite adding higher-dimensional operators, all such operators must respect Poincaré symmetry by transforming properly under translations and Lorentz transformations, so yes, every SMEFT operator must respect Poincaré symmetry.\nCoT agent 9v6F, on the purpose of analyzing CP symmetry, thinking: CP symmetry is a discrete transformation (charge conjugation + parity) that can be broken in the Standard Model (e.g. CKM phase) and plays a key role in baryogenesis. The SMEFT construction principle is to include all operators consistent with gauge, Lorentz, and Poincaré symmetries; discrete symmetries like CP may be violated and such violations are phenomenologically important. Hence CP need not be enforced for every operator.; answer: CP symmetry is not required to be respected by all SMEFT operators; CP-violating operators are allowed and necessary to capture observed CP violation.\nCoT agent Hj0Z, on the purpose of analyzing CPT symmetry, thinking: CPT symmetry follows from the CPT theorem in any local, Lorentz-invariant, unitary quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. SMEFT operators are built to respect locality, Lorentz invariance, and unitarity, so CPT invariance holds automatically. Therefore all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.; answer: In SMEFT, CPT symmetry is guaranteed by the CPT theorem whenever the theory is local, Lorentz-invariant, unitary, and has a Hermitian Hamiltonian. Since SMEFT is constructed to satisfy these conditions, every operator in the effective field theory must respect CPT symmetry.\nDebate agent FDOx, round 0, on the purpose of determining the correct combination of symmetries, thinking: Sub-tasks conclude that Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4) symmetries are required, while CP (3) is not. Hence the combination is 1,2,4, corresponding to choice 4 which is D).; answer: D)\nDebate agent 4Awy, round 0, on the purpose of determining the correct combination of symmetries, thinking: Lorentz symmetry (1) is required for all operators to be relativistically invariant. Poincaré symmetry (2) combines Lorentz invariance with spacetime translations and is foundational to any QFT in Minkowski space, so must be respected. CP symmetry (3) can be violated in the SM and thus need not be enforced. CPT symmetry (4) follows from the CPT theorem given locality, Lorentz invariance, and unitarity, so all operators respect it.
