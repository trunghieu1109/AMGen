Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We need to compare XIST-mediated X-chromosome inactivation in Klinefelter’s syndrome with the lack of any analogous silencing mechanism in Down’s syndrome, emphasizing the recruitment of histone and DNA methyltransferases in KS and the unmitigated gene dosage in trisomy 21.

Answer:In Klinefelter’s syndrome (typically XXY), the extra X chromosome is largely silenced by the XIST long noncoding RNA, which coats the surplus X and recruits histone methyltransferases (e.g., EZH2) and DNA methyltransferases to deposit repressive marks (H3K27me3, DNA CpG methylation), forming facultative heterochromatin and preventing overexpression of most X-linked genes (though ~15% escape inactivation). By contrast, in Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) there is no analogous chromosome-wide inactivation mechanism; all three copies of chromosome 21 remain transcriptionally active, causing a global ~1.5-fold overexpression of hundreds of genes and resulting in more pronounced developmental and physiological abnormalities.
