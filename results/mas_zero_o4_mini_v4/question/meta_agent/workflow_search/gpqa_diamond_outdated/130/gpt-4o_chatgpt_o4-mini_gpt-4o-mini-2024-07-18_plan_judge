Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=1)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 130_Iteration_0
proposed answer: In the endo major product the bridgehead methine proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) is close in space to the anhydride methylene protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), yielding the NOESY cross‚Äêpeak.
