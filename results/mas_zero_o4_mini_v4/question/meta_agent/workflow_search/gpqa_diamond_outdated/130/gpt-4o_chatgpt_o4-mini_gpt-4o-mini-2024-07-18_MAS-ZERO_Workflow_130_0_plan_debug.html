    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, choice2=&#39;A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm&#39;, choice3=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm&#39;, choice4=&#39;A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm&#39;, correct_index=1).

### Sub-task 2: Final decision on product structures. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent O8n0:
The Diels–Alder reaction between the cis-alkene anhydride (maleic anhydride) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene yields norbornene-type bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride adducts. Secondary orbital (endo) interactions favor approach of the anhydride syn to the methyl‐bearing face, giving the endo isomer as the major product and the exo isomer as the minor product.

### answer by Final Decision Agent O8n0:
Major product: the endo bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride adduct with the anhydride bridge oriented syn to the four methyl groups on the former diene (tetramethylcyclopentadiene) ring; Minor product: the exo bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride adduct with the anhydride bridge oriented anti to the four methyl groups.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gcuh (yourself):
In the endo product the bridgehead methine (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) lies close in space to the anhydride methylene protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), giving the observed NOESY cross‐peak.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gcuh (yourself):
B)

### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the NOESY NMR analysis and correct if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent r9oW:
The NOESY interpretation is correct. The observed cross‐peak between the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridgehead methine) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride methylene) is exactly what you’d expect for the endo adduct, confirming their close spatial proximity.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gcuh (yourself):
In the endo isomer the bridgehead methine 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm is spatially close to the anhydride methylene 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, giving rise to the observed NOESY cross-peak.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gcuh (yourself):
B)

### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the NOESY NMR analysis and correct if necessary. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent r9oW:
The NOESY analysis is correct: the spatial proximity of the bridgehead methine proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) to the anhydride methylene (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) produces the observed cross‐peak, confirming the endo configuration of the major product.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gcuh (yourself):
In the endo isomer the bridgehead methine (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) lies close in space to the anhydride methylene (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), producing the NOESY cross-peak.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gcuh (yourself):
B)

### Sub-task 3: Provide feedback on the NOESY NMR analysis and correct if necessary. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent r9oW:
The analysis correctly identifies the spatial proximity in the endo isomer between the bridgehead methine proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the anhydride methylene protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm), which gives rise to the observed NOESY cross‐peak.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the structures of the major and minor products, analyze the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product to identify which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
