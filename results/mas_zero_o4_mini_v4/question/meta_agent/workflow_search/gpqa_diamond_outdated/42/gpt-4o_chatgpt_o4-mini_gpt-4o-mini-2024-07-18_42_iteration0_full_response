Counting around the ring to give substituents the lowest possible set of locants: at C2 = hydroxy, C3 = cyano, C4 = methoxy, C5 = formyl, C6 = dimethylamino. Alphabetical order of substituents (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) with their locants gives the name.; answer: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nDebate agent ezO7, round 0, on the purpose of determining IUPAC name, thinking: We number the benzene ring with the carboxylic acid as C-1. Two numbering directions give the same locant set {2,3,4,5,6}, so we apply the alphabetical first point of difference rule. Comparing substituents at C-2 in the two directions (dimethylamino vs hydroxy), “dimethylamino” precedes “hydroxy” alphabetically, so the correct numbering is anti‐clockwise: C-2 hydroxy, C-3 cyano, C-4 methoxy, C-5 formyl, C-6 dimethylamino. This corresponds to choice B.; answer: B)\nDebate agent ABDn, round 0, on the purpose of determining IUPAC name, thinking: Numbering from the carboxyl group at C1 gives substituents at C2=OH, C3=CN, C4=OCH₃, C5=CHO, C6=NMe₂.

Applying the alphabetical first point of difference rule at C-2: “hydroxy” (H) precedes “dimethylamino” (D), so C-2 is hydroxy, C-3 is cyano, C-4 is methoxy, C-5 is formyl, C-6 is dimethylamino.
