The stereochemistry at C4 remains (S).; answer: (S)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\nCoT-SC agent q69j, on the purpose of solving sub-task 2, thinking: Starting from (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one, Ph2CuLi adds the phenyl group in a conjugate 1,4-addition to the β-carbon (C3), generating the enolate at C1. Subsequent benzyl bromide alkylates the enolate at the α-carbon (C2). The C4 stereocenter remains S, and the addition steps set C3 as R and C2 as S.; answer: (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\nCoT-SC agent 3IcK, on the purpose of solving sub-task 2, thinking: The Ph2CuLi performs a 1,4-conjugate addition, installing a phenyl at the β-position (C3) and generating an enolate at the carbonyl, which upon alkylation with benzyl bromide gives a benzyl group at the α-position (C2). The TBS ether remains at C4 with S stereochemistry; the new centers at C2 and C3 are formed with predictable relative stereochemistry (phenyl and benzyl cis to the TBS group).; answer: (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohexan-1-one\nCoT-SC agent NcUY, on the purpose of solving sub-task 2, thinking: The cuprate Ph2CuLi does a 1,4‐addition of Ph– to the enone, giving an enolate at C1, which is then alkylated by BnBr at C2. The TBS ether at C4 remains intact with its original (S) configuration. The newly formed stereocenters at C3 (phenyl addition) and C2 (benzylation) are formed anti to the bulky TBS group, giving (2S,3R,4S) configuration.; answer: (2S,3R,4S)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-benzyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\nReflexion CoT agent QqTv, on the purpose of solving sub-task 3, thinking: Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(TBDMS)oxy-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one. Treatment with LDA at low temperature will deprotonate the less hindered α-position at C6, forming the kinetic enolate, which upon alkylation with iodomethane introduces a methyl at C6. The existing stereocenters at C2, C3, and C4 remain unchanged. Based on the known outcome of the subsequent deprotection step (which yields C6 as S in the final product), the new stereocenter at C6 is S in product 3.; answer: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\nCritic agent iMkA, on the purpose of solving sub-task 3, feedback: The proposed structure correctly reflects kinetic enolate formation at C6 followed by methylation, preserving the existing stereocenters and introducing the new S-configured methyl at C6.
