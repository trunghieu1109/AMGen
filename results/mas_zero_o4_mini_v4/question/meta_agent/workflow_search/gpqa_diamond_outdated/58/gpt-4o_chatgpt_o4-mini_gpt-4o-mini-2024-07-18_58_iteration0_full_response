With 0.08\u2009mol HCl and 0.09\u2009mol Ba(OH)2, HCl is limiting, so all 0.08\u2009mol HCl is consumed, consuming 0.04\u2009mol Ba(OH)2 and leaving 0.05\u2009mol Ba(OH)2. That leftover Ba(OH)2 corresponds to 0.10\u2009mol OH−. Next neutralize weak acid: CH3COOH + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O. With 0.05\u2009mol CH3COOH and 0.10\u2009mol OH−, CH3COOH is limiting, so all 0.05\u2009mol CH3COOH is consumed, consuming 0.05\u2009mol OH− and producing 0.05\u2009mol CH3COO−, leaving 0.05\u2009mol OH−.; answer: Reaction 1: Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n • HCl consumed: 0.08 → 0 mol\n • Ba(OH)2 consumed: 0.04 mol, remaining Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 − 0.04 = 0.05 mol\nReaction 2: CH3COOH + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O\n • CH3COOH consumed: 0.05 → 0 mol\n • OH− (from leftover Ba(OH)2) initially = 0.05 × 2 = 0.10 mol; consumed 0.05 → remaining OH− = 0.05 mol\n • CH3COO− formed: 0.05 mol\nFinal remaining moles:\n • CH3COOH: 0 mol\n • HCl: 0 mol\n • Ba(OH)2: 0.05 mol\n • OH−: 0.05 mol\n • CH3COO−: 0.05 mol\nCritic agent Xlyw, on the purpose of reviewing reactions, thinking: The chain-of-thought correctly identifies the limiting reagents, balances each neutralization reaction, and computes the remaining moles consistently.; answer: Reaction 1: Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n • HCl consumed: 0.08 mol → 0 mol\n • Ba(OH)2 consumed: 0.04 mol, remaining Ba(OH)2 = 0.05 mol\nReaction 2: CH3COOH + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O\n • CH3COOH consumed: 0.05 mol → 0 mol\n • OH− (0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 ×2 = 0.10 mol) consumed: 0.05 mol → remaining OH− = 0.05 mol\n • CH3COO− formed: 0.05 mol\nFinal remaining moles:\n • CH3COOH: 0 mol\n • HCl: 0 mol\n • Ba(OH)2: 0.05 mol\n • OH−: 0.05 mol\n • CH3COO−: 0.05 mol\nCoT agent IXzb, on the purpose of refining reactions, thinking: We use the moles from sub‐task 1 (0.05 mol CH₃COOH, 0.08 mol HCl, 0.09 mol Ba(OH)₂).
