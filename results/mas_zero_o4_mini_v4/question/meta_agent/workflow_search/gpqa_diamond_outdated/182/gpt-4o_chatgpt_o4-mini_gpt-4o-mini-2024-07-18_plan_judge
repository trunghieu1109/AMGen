Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=0)
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 182_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (C10H20). A fully saturated acyclic C10 compound would be C10H22. The deficiency of 2 H corresponds to one degree of unsaturation (the ring).
