proposed answer: Considering the benzyne formation pathways and symmetry: deprotonation at C2 removes the deuterium and, regardless of attack site, yields unsubstituted aniline as a single product. Deprotonation at C6 retains the deuterium (at original C2) and nucleophilic attack at either benzyne carbon yields two distinct deuterated anilines (ortho- and meta-D). Hence a total of three products.

Answer:Possible organic products:
1) Aniline (C6H5NH2)
2) 2-Deuteroaniline (D at the ortho position relative to NH2)
3) 3-Deuteroaniline (D at the meta position relative to NH2)
Extracted answer: Possible organic products:
Correct answer: 1
