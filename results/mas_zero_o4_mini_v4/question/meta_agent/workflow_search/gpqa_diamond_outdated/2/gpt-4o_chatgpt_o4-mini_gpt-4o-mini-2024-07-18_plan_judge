Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Using the results ⟨σ_z⟩ = −0.5 and ⟨σ_x⟩ ≈ 0.866 from sub-tasks 1 and 2, we compute 10(−0.5) + 5(0.866) = −5 + 4.33 = −0.67 ≈ −0.7.

Answer:-0.7
Extracted answer: -0.7
Correct answer: 3
