Example(question=&#39;1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;doublet of triplets&#39;, choice2=&#39;triplet of triplets&#39;, choice3=&#39;pentet&#39;, choice4=&#39;triplet&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the structure of product 3, determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum, excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent czC7:
In 1,2-adamantanedione the most deshielded methine proton at C3 couples to two distinct sets of vicinal protons (on C4 and C5) with different J values, giving a triplet of triplets.

### thinking by Debate Agent BaJe:
Product 3 is 1,2-adamantanedione. The methine proton at C3 is vicinal to two distinct sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants, yielding a triplet of triplets.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9OSQ:
Product 3 is 1,2-adamantanedione. The most deshielded proton (at C3) is vicinal to two sets of nonequivalent protons (on C4 and C5) with different coupling constants, yielding a triplet of triplets.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6zre:
Product 3 is 1,2-adamantanedione; the most deshielded methine proton at C3 couples to two distinct sets of vicinal protons with different J values, yielding a triplet of triplets.

### answer by Debate Agent czC7:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent BaJe:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 9OSQ:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 6zre:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the structure of product 3, determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum, excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
