Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Optical isomerism requires a chiral (asymmetric) center. Among the listed compounds, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has an sp3 carbon bonded to four different substituents, so it alone exhibits optical isomerism.

Answer:Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.
Extracted answer: Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.
Correct answer: 1
