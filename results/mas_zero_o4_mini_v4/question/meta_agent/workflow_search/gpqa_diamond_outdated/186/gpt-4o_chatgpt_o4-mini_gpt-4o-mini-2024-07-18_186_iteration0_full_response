It offers three main resolution modes: UHR (R≈190 000), HR (R≈140 000), and MR (R≈70 000) depending on UT combination and fibre configuration. Its wavelength coverage spans 380–788 nm. The instrument is housed in a temperature- and pressure-stabilized vacuum vessel and uses simultaneous calibration with a laser frequency comb or ThAr lamp, achieving a radial-velocity precision down to ≲10 cm/s. Typical performance (1-hour exposure, one UT, HR mode) reaches S/N≈10 per binned pixel at about V≈15\u2009mag; using all four UTs can extend this limit to V≈16\u2009mag.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the expected S/N for each star and determine if it meets the detectability threshold. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4cf9:\nUsing the ESPRESSO HR-mode 1-UT performance (S/N≈10 at V=15 in 1\u2009h) and assuming S/N scales as 10^{-0.4(V−15)}, I computed apparent V for each star and then S/N.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4cf9:\na) Canopus (V≈−0.72): S/N≈10×10^{−0.4(−0.72−15)}≈2×10^{7} → detectable\nb) Polaris (V≈1.98): S/N≈10×10^{−0.4(1.98−15)}≈1.6×10^{6} → detectable\nc) M_V=15 @10\u2009pc ⇒ V=15.0: S/N≈10 → detectable\nd) M_V=15 @200\u2009pc ⇒ V≈21.5: S/N≈0.025 → not detectable\ne) M_V=15 @5\u2009pc ⇒ V≈13.5: S/N≈40 → detectable\nf) M_V=15 @50\u2009pc ⇒ V≈18.5: S/N≈0.4 → not detectable\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine which stars are detectable and count them.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent Qp9t, on the purpose of extracting ESPRESSO capabilities, thinking: I reviewed the ESO overview of ESPRESSO and identified its main technical specifications and performance capabilities.; answer: ESPRESSO is a fibre-fed, cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph operating at the combined focus of one or up to four 8.2 m VLT Unit Telescopes.
