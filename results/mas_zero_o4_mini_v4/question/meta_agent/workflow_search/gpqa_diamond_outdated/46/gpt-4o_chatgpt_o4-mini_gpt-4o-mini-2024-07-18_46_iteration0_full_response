The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical of a carbonyl stretch; its position near 1720 cm⁻¹ is more consistent with an ester rather than an amide. Given the molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂, this supports the presence of an NH₂ group and an ester C=O.; answer: Primary amine (NH₂) and ester carbonyl (C=O)\nCoT agent 1pvS, on the purpose of analyzing 1H NMR spectrum, thinking: The 1H NMR data correspond to an ethyl ester of a para‐substituted benzene with an –NH2 group. The 3H triplet and 2H quartet arise from the ethoxy group, the broad 2H singlet is the amino protons, and the two aromatic doublets (2H each) are the para‐disubstituted benzene protons.; answer: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): methyl (CH3) of ethyl ester adjacent to CH2\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): methylene (CH2) of ethyl ester adjacent to oxygen\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): amino (NH2) protons\n7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons of para-disubstituted benzene ring\nDebate agent rkYI, round 0, on the purpose of correlating findings, thinking: The IR indicates an NH₂ and an ester C=O.
