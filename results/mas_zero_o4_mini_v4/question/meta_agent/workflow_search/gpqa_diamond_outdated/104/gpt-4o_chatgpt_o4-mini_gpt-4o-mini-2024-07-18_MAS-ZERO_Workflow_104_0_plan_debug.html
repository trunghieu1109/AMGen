    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#34;Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star&#39;s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?&#34;, choice1=&#39;~0.07&#39;, choice2=&#39;~0.32&#39;, choice3=&#39;~0.11&#39;, choice4=&#39;~0.39&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, compare the brightness decrease and determine the relative radius of the exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar). 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 94BA:
Equating the spot–induced flux drop ΔF/F≈0.1035 to a transit depth δ=(Rpl/Rstar)^2 gives Rpl/Rstar=√0.1035≈0.32, corresponding to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent rB7c:
Equating the spot–induced flux drop ΔF/F≈0.1035 to a transit depth δ=(Rpl/Rstar)^2 gives Rpl/Rstar=√0.1035≈0.32.

### thinking by Debate Agent D3gh:
From sub-task 1 the spot-induced flux drop ΔF/F≈0.1035 equated to a transit depth gives Rpl/Rstar≈0.32, matching choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent YrXs:
From sub-task 1, the spot-induced flux drop is ΔF/F ≈0.1035. Equating this to a transit depth δ=(Rpl/Rstar)^2 and solving Rpl/Rstar=√0.1035 gives ≈0.32.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, compare the brightness decrease and determine the relative radius of the exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
