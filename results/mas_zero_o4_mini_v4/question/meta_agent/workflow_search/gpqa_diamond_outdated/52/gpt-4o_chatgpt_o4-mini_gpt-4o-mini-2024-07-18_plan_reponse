            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "The NMR integrations sum to 12 H (4 aromatic + 2 vinyl + 6 methyl), matching C11H12O2, not C11H14O2. The two aromatic signals indicate a para-disubstituted benzene. The vinyl protons (Jtrans\u224816\u2009Hz) and methyl coupling indicate an E-1-propenyl substituent. One methyl singlet is from the ester O\u2013CH3. Thus the compound is methyl (E)-4-(1-propenyl)benzoate (C11H12O2).\n\nAnswer:Methyl (E)-4-(1-propenyl)benzoate (C11H12O2)",
