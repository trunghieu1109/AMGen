    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?&#39;, choice1=&#39;4&#39;, choice2=&#39;6&#39;, choice3=&#39;8&#39;, choice4=&#39;2&#39;, correct_index=1). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the type of reaction that occurs when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent MHjR:
Grubbs catalysts are well-known for catalyzing olefin metathesis reactions, including self- or cross-metathesis of alkenes. Here, a single terminal alkene undergoes self-metathesis, exchanging alkylidene fragments between two substrate molecules.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent MHjR:
Olefin metathesis

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of Sub-task 1, determine the possible intermediate steps and products formed. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY:
The olefin metathesis mechanism proceeds by formation of a Ru–alkylidene, addition to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, cycloreversion to give ethene and a new Ru–alkylidene, then a second metallacyclobutane cycle to release the homodimer and regenerate the catalyst. The racemic starting alkene gives both enantiomeric and meso dimeric products in E and Z forms, totaling six stereoisomers.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY:
Intermediate steps:
1) Ligand exchange of the Grubbs catalyst benzylidene with CH2=CH–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3 to form a substrate-derived Ru–alkylidene.
2) [2+2] cycloaddition to give metallacyclobutane I.
3) Cycloreversion to release ethene and generate a new Ru–alkylidene bound to CH–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3.
4) Second [2+2] cycloaddition between that Ru–alkylidene and another CH2=CH–substrate to form metallacyclobutane II.
5) Cycloreversion to release the homodimeric internal alkene and regenerate the catalyst.

Products (excluding ethene):
– Homodimer X–CH=CH–X in E and Z configurations, where X = CH2–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3.
– For each E or Z: R–R and S–S coupling give an enantiomeric pair, and R–S (plus S–R) gives a meso diastereomer.
Total = 6 stereoisomeric dimeric alkenes.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of Sub-task 1 and 2, calculate the number of possible unique products (excluding ethene).

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
