    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?&#39;, choice1=&#39;~ 1/plx^3&#39;, choice2=&#39;~ 1/plx^2&#39;, choice3=&#39;~ 1/plx^1&#39;, choice4=&#39;~ 1/plx^4&#39;, correct_index=3). 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, deduce how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent kdGG:
For a uniform spatial density, the number of stars in a shell at distance d is dN ∝ d² dd. With d = 1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp, substitution gives dN/dp ∝ (1/p²)(1/p²) = 1/p⁴.

### thinking by Debate Agent LHO1:
For a uniform spatial density ρ, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is dN = 4πd^2ρ dd. With parallax p, d = 1/p so dd = (dd/dp)dp = (−1/p^2)dp (absolute value 1/p^2dp). Substituting gives dN/dp ∝ d^2 |dd/dp| ∝ (1/p^2)(1/p^2) = 1/p^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent tXou:
For a uniform spatial distribution, number in shell ∝d^2 dd. With d=1/p and dd=|dd/dp|dp=1/p^2 dp, so dN/dp∝(1/p^2)(1/p^2)=1/p^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent EGTb:
From sub-task 1, d ∝ 1/p; from sub-task 2, uniform density. Number in shell ∝ d² dd. With d=1/p and dd=|dd/dp|dp = 1/p² dp, we get dN/dp ∝ (1/p²)(1/p²) = 1/p⁴.

### answer by Debate Agent kdGG:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent LHO1:
The number of stars per unit range of parallax scales as 1/parallax^4.

### answer by Debate Agent tXou:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent EGTb:
The number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as 1/plx^4.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, deduce how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
