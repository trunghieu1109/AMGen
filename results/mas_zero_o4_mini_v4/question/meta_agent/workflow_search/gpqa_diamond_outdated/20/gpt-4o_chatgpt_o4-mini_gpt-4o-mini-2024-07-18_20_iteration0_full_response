Benzoquinone’s carbonyl carbons have no α-hydrogens, so it cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and can form enol tautomers.; answer: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it lacks α-hydrogens necessary for keto–enol tautomeric shifts.\nCoT agent uKbi, for sub-task 2, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl and methoxycarbonyl groups, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT agent y8Fe, for sub-task 2, thinking: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a carbon bearing four different substituents (–CH3, –H, –OH, –COOCH3), making it chiral and optically active. Dimethyl fumarate lacks any stereocenter.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT agent VWWJ, for sub-task 2, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic carbon bearing four different substituents, so it can exist as enantiomers.
