Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Noble‐metal catalysts like Pd and Pt are known to enable chain‐walking ethylene polymerization, yielding regularly branched polyethylene under laboratory or pilot conditions. However, the raw‐material cost of precious metals and the need for specialized ligands, combined with generally lower turnover numbers, shorter catalyst lifetimes, and more complex separation and recycling protocols compared to base‐metal systems, drive the catalyst cost per tonne of polymer to levels that are prohibitively high for large‐scale industrial application.

Answer:Noble‐metal catalysts (e.g. Pd, Pt) can technically perform chain‐walking polymerization of ethylene to introduce regular branches, but their high metal and ligand costs, lower productivity and catalyst lifetime, and difficult recovery/recycling render them economically uncompetitive for commercial-scale production of branched polyethylene.
Extracted answer: Noble‐metal catalysts (e.g. Pd, Pt) can technically perform chain‐walking polymerization of ethylene to introduce regular branches, but their high metal and ligand costs, lower productivity and catalyst lifetime, and difficult recovery/recycling render them economically uncompetitive for commercial-scale production of branched polyethylene.
