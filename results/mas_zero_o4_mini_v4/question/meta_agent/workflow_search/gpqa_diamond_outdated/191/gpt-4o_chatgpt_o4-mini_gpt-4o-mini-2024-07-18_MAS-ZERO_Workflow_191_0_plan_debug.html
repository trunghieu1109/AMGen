    <pre>Related original question:

Example(question=&#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, choice1=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, choice2=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, choice3=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, choice4=&#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;, correct_index=3).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, determine the correct choice for the electric field at point P from the given options. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent eiGD:
Outside the conductor the net enclosed charge is +q and by Gauss’s law the field behaves as if all charge were concentrated at the conductor’s center at distance L, giving E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

### thinking by Debate Agent KBSH:
The external field of a charged conductor acts as if the total enclosed charge +q is concentrated at its center. The distance to point P from the conductor’s center is L, so E = (1/4πε₀) q / L², which corresponds to choice D).

### thinking by Debate Agent O1f0:
Outside the conductor, the net enclosed charge is +q and by Gauss’s law the field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor at distance L, matching choice D).

### answer by Debate Agent eiGD:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent KBSH:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent O1f0:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make the final decision based on all debates.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
