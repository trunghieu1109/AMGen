Starting from l=0, m=0, the only allowed l′=1 and m′=−1,0,1. In hydrogen the next lower principal quantum number is n′=2, so the three possible intermediate states are |2,1,−1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.; answer: The allowed dipole transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are:\n|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩\n|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩\n|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩\nCoT-SC agent hvkM, on the purpose of identifying transitions to |1,0,0⟩, thinking: Dipole selection rules Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1 apply. For each intermediate |2,1,m'⟩, we have l:1→0 (Δl=-1 OK) and m':±1 or 0 → m=0 gives Δm=±1 or 0, all allowed.
