proposed answer: Dimethyloxosulfonium methylide (Corey–Chaykovsky reagent) cyclopropanates the α,β-unsaturated ketone Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)Me, inserting one CH₂ unit across the C=C bond. The starting enone has 10 carbons (6 in the phenyl, 2 in the alkene, 1 in the carbonyl, 1 in the methyl). Adding one CH₂ gives a product with 11 carbons.

Answer:Product 3 is 1-phenyl-2-acetylcyclopropane and contains 11 carbon atoms.
Extracted answer: Product 3 is 1-phenyl-2-acetylcyclopropane and contains 11 carbon atoms.
Correct answer: 2
