Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid, we need to analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of a sequence of moves right (R) and up (U) that ultimately leads from the bottom left corner (0,0) to the top right corner (8,8). A path that changes direction exactly four times will consist of segments of R's and U's, with each segment representing a straight line in one direction before changing to the other direction. Since the path must end at (8,8), it must consist of exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, totaling 16 moves. The four changes in direction imply that there will be five segments in total (since a change in direction creates a new segment). We can denote the lengths of these segments as (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) where a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 = 8 (for R's) and similarly for U's. The number of ways to distribute the moves into segments while ensuring that each segment has at least one move is a combinatorial problem. We can use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's and 8 U's into 5 segments, ensuring that each segment has at least one move. This leads us to the combinatorial formula for distributing n indistinguishable objects into k distinguishable boxes with at least one object in each box. After calculating, we find the total number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.
