        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. If a path changes direction exactly four times, it can be broken into five segments, each consisting of consecutive R's or U's. We can have two possible patterns for the segments: R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U. Each segment must have a positive number of moves, and the total number of R's and U's must be 8 each. Let's consider the pattern R-U-R-U-R. Let the number of R's in each segment be a, c, and e, and the number of U's be b and d. We have the equations a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. The number of solutions to a + c + e = 8 with a, c, e > 0 is the number of solutions to a' + c' + e' = 5 with a', c', e' >= 0, which is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\). Similarly, the number of solutions to b + d = 8 with b, d > 0 is the number of solutions to b' + d' = 6 with b', d' >= 0, which is \\( \\binom{7}{1} = 7 \\). Therefore, there are 21 * 7 = 147 paths for the R-U-R-U-R pattern. By symmetry, there are also 147 paths for the U-R-U-R-U pattern. Thus, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.\n\nAnswer:294",
