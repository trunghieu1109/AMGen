        "response": "We need paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 16 steps (8 E and 8 N) and exactly 4 direction changes. A path with k changes has k+1 runs of constant direction. Here k=4 gives 5 runs. There are two cases: start with E or start with N. If starting with E the pattern is E,N,E,N,E: that\u2019s 3 E\u2010runs summing to 8 and 2 N\u2010runs summing to 8, each run at least 1. The number of positive compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2)=21, into 2 parts is C(7,1)=7, so 21\u00d77=147. Similarly if starting with N, we get another 147. Total = 147+147 = 294.\n\nAnswer:294",
