        "response": "We need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. After checking small primes, we find that for p = 5, n = 2 works since 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. However, for n = 3, we have 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is also not divisible by 25. Continuing this process, we find that for n = 4, 4^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. We need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. Testing values of m, we find that m = 5 gives us 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is not divisible by 25. Testing m = 10 gives us 10^4 + 1 = 10001, which is also not divisible by 25. Testing m = 15 gives us 15^4 + 1 = 50626, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is 15.\n\nAnswer:15",
