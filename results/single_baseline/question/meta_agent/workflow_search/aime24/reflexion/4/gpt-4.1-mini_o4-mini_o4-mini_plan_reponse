        "response": "We seek the smallest prime p for which there exists n with p^2|n^4+1. Check small primes: for p=2,3,5,7,11,13 no solutions mod p. For p=17, one finds n^4\u2261\u22121 mod17 has solutions n\u22612,8,9,15; Hensel\u2019s lemma lifts each to a unique solution mod289. Writing n=a+17k and expanding (a+17k)^4 \u2261a^4+68a^3k (mod289) gives a linear equation for k in each case. The four lifts in 1\u2264n<289 are n=155,134,110,179. The least positive is 110.\n\nAnswer:110",
