Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We seek the smallest prime p for which there exists n with p^2|n^4+1. Check small primes: for p=2,3,5,7,11,13 no solutions mod p. For p=17, one finds n^4≡−1 mod17 has solutions n≡2,8,9,15; Hensel’s lemma lifts each to a unique solution mod289. Writing n=a+17k and expanding (a+17k)^4 ≡a^4+68a^3k (mod289) gives a linear equation for k in each case. The four lifts in 1≤n<289 are n=155,134,110,179. The least positive is 110.
