proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. This means that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). We start by considering small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 4), which is never 0, so p cannot be 2. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 2 works because 2^4 + 1 = 17, and 17 ≡ 0 (mod 9). Therefore, p = 3 is the smallest prime. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 9. We already found that m = 2 works, as 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is divisible by 9.
