    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 635G (yourself):
To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we can start by checking small prime numbers. We will check if n^4 + 1 can be congruent to 0 modulo p^2 for various primes. We will also need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 once we find p.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 635G (yourself):
5

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent A6iQ:
The answer provided is incorrect. The least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is actually 5, but the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 is not 5. We need to find the correct m by checking values of m until we find one that satisfies the condition.

    <pre>We need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. After checking small primes, we find that for p = 5, n = 2 works since 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. However, for n = 3, we have 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is also not divisible by 25. Continuing this process, we find that for n = 4, 4^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. We need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. Testing values of m, we find that m = 5 gives us 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is not divisible by 25. Testing m = 10 gives us 10^4 + 1 = 10001, which is also not divisible by 25. Testing m = 15 gives us 15^4 + 1 = 50626, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is 15.
