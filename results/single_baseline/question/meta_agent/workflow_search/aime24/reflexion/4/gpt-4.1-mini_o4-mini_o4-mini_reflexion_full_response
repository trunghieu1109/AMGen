Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent v8x5', content='We seek the smallest prime p for which there exists n with p^2|n^4+1. Check small primes: for p=2,3,5,7,11,13 no solutions mod p. For p=17, one finds n^4≡−1 mod17 has solutions n≡2,8,9,15; Hensel’s lemma lifts each to a unique solution mod289. Writing n=a+17k and expanding (a+17k)^4 ≡a^4+68a^3k (mod289) gives a linear equation for k in each case. The four lifts in 1≤n<289 are n=155,134,110,179. The least positive is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
