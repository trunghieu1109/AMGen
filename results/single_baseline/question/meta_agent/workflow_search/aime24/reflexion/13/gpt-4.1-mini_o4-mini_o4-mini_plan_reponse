The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We model the chain of eight circles of radius 34 and the chain of 2024 circles of radius 1 as two alternating tangent\u2010circle chains in the same corner of angle \u03b8.  A known wedge\u2010chain formula gives (for alternating chains) \n   r\u00b7[1+2(n\u22121)\u2009sin(\u03b8/2)] = R\u00b7[1+2(N\u22121)\u2009sin(\u03b8/2)]\nwhen two chains of lengths n,N and radii r,R fit the same angle \u03b8.  Plugging n=8, r=34 and N=2024, R=1, we get\n   34[1+14\u2009s] = 1[1+4046\u2009s],  where s=sin(\u03b8/2).  \nThus 476+476\u2009s\u00b714=1+4046\u2009s \u21d2 476=1+3612\u2009s \u21d2 s=11/1190.  \nThe inradius of triangle ABC is then\n   r_in = r\u00b7(1+2(n\u22121)s)/(1+s) = 34\u00b7(1+28\u00b7(11/1190))/(1+11/1190)\n       = 45696/1201.\nHence m+n=45696+1201=46897.\n\nAnswer:46897",
