The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the inradius of triangle ABC, we need to analyze the arrangement of the circles. The eight circles of radius 34 are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle. The two circles tangent to sides AB and BC will help us determine the dimensions of the triangle. The inradius can be derived from the relationship between the radius of the circles and the geometry of the triangle. The arrangement of the 2024 circles of radius 1 suggests a similar configuration, which can be used to find a scaling factor. We will calculate the inradius based on the given radii and the number of circles, and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers. Finally, we will sum m and n to provide the final answer.\n\nAnswer:2025",
