Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We model the chain of eight circles of radius 34 and the chain of 2024 circles of radius 1 as two alternating tangent‐circle chains in the same corner of angle θ.  A known wedge‐chain formula gives (for alternating chains) 
   r·[1+2(n−1) sin(θ/2)] = R·[1+2(N−1) sin(θ/2)]
when two chains of lengths n,N and radii r,R fit the same angle θ.  Plugging n=8, r=34 and N=2024, R=1, we get
   34[1+14 s] = 1[1+4046 s],  where s=sin(θ/2).  
Thus 476+476 s·14=1+4046 s ⇒ 476=1+3612 s ⇒ s=11/1190.  
The inradius of triangle ABC is then
   r_in = r·(1+2(n−1)s)/(1+s) = 34·(1+28·(11/1190))/(1+11/1190)
       = 45696/1201.
Hence m+n=45696+1201=46897.
