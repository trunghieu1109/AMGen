Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We have a configuration where eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent, and two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of triangle ABC. Similarly, 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. We need to find the inradius of triangle ABC. The key is to understand the relationship between the number of circles and the inradius. The inradius is proportional to the radius of the circles and the number of circles. For the circles of radius 34, the inradius is 34. For the circles of radius 1, the inradius is 1. The number of circles is 8 for radius 34 and 2024 for radius 1. The inradius is proportional to the number of circles times the radius. Therefore, the inradius for the circles of radius 1 is (2024/8) * 1 = 253. The inradius of the triangle with circles of radius 1 is 253. The inradius can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Here, m = 253 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 253 + 1 = 254.
