Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we will start from 9999 and check each number downwards. For each number, we will change each digit to 1 one at a time and check if the resulting number is divisible by 7. We will continue this process until we find the largest number that satisfies the condition. Once we find N, we will compute Q and R from N and return their sum.
