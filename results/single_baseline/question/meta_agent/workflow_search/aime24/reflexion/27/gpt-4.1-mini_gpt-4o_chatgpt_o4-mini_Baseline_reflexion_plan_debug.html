    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xOUp (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start by considering the number N = 9999, the largest four-digit number, and check if changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. If not, we decrement N and repeat the process until we find such a number. Once we find N, we calculate Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, we find Q + R.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xOUp (yourself):
1009

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent NaJJ:
The solution approach is correct, but the final answer needs verification. We need to ensure that the number found satisfies the condition for all digit changes to 1 and is indeed the largest such number.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
