Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Rub3', content='To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we will start from 9999 and check each number downwards.

We will check each number to see if it meets the criteria. For each digit position, we will change that digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7. We will continue this until we find the largest number that satisfies the condition. Once we find N, we will compute Q and R from N and return their sum.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Rub3 (yourself):\n1003\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent ocqP:\nThe answer 1003 is incorrect. The process of finding the greatest four-digit integer N that meets the criteria was not properly executed. The correct approach involves checking each digit of the largest four-digit numbers downwards and ensuring that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The correct N needs to be determined through this method.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.'}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
