Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cbIC', content='We need a four-digit integer N = abcd such that replacing any one digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.  Let a,b,c,d be its digits.  For each position we write a congruence mod 7:\n(1) Replace a: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 ⇒ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 ⇒ 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1\n(2) Replace b: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 ⇒ 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 ⇒ 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5\n(3) Replace c: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 ⇒ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 ⇒ 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4\n(4) Replace d: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 ⇒ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 ⇒ 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6\n\nSubtracting and reducing gives a system in a,b,c mod 7:\n3a - b ≡ 2;\n6a - 3c ≡ 3;\n6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6.\nSolving yields a ≡ 5 mod 7 ⇒ a=5, b ≡ 6 mod 7 ⇒ b=6, c ≡ 2 mod 7 ⇒ c=2 or 9, and then d ≡ 4 mod 7 ⇒ d=4.\nThus the only candidates are 5624 and 5694, both of which check out.  The greatest is N = 5694.  Dividing by 1000 gives Q = 5, R = 694, and Q + R = 699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
