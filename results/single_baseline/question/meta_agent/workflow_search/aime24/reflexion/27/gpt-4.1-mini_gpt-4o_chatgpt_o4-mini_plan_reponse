        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start by considering the number N = 9999, the largest four-digit number, and check if changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. If not, we decrement N and repeat the process until we find such a number. Once we find N, we calculate Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, we find Q + R.\n\nAnswer:1009",
