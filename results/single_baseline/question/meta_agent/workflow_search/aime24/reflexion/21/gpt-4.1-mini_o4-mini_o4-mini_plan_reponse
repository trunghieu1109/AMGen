        "response": "We need to count all rectangles whose vertices are among the 12 vertices of a regular 12\u2010gon and whose sides lie along its sides or diagonals. Any rectangle inscribed in a circle has its diagonals as diameters of the circle. The 12\u2010gon has 6 diameters (each connects a vertex to the opposite one). Choosing any 2 distinct diameters gives 4 endpoints that form a rectangle. There are C(6,2)=15 ways to choose 2 diameters, so there are 15 such rectangles.\n\nAnswer:15",
