        "response": "To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed using its vertices. A rectangle requires two pairs of opposite sides to be parallel and equal in length. In a regular dodecagon, we can use both the sides and the diagonals to form these rectangles. The vertices of the dodecagon can be labeled as V0, V1, V2, ..., V11. A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices such that they are opposite each other. The key is to find pairs of vertices that can be connected to form the sides of the rectangle. We will count the valid combinations of vertices that can form rectangles. Each rectangle can be formed by choosing 2 pairs of opposite vertices, and we need to ensure that these vertices are spaced evenly around the dodecagon. The total number of ways to choose 2 pairs of opposite vertices from 12 vertices is calculated using combinatorial methods.\n\nAnswer:The number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon is 30.",
