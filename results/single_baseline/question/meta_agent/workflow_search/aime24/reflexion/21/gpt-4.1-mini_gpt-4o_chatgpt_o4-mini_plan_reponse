        "response": "To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be used to form these parallel sides. We can label the vertices of the dodecagon as 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. For a regular polygon with 12 sides, the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite vertices is given by the formula for choosing 2 pairs of opposite vertices from n vertices, which is \\( \\binom{n/2}{2} \\). For a dodecagon, n = 12, so we have \\( \\binom{6}{2} = 15 \\). Therefore, there are 15 rectangles that can be formed inside the dodecagon.\n\nAnswer:15",
