Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need to count all rectangles whose vertices are among the 12 vertices of a regular 12‐gon and whose sides lie along its sides or diagonals. Any rectangle inscribed in a circle has its diagonals as diameters of the circle. The 12‐gon has 6 diameters (each connects a vertex to the opposite one). Choosing any 2 distinct diameters gives 4 endpoints that form a rectangle. There are C(6,2)=15 ways to choose 2 diameters, so there are 15 such rectangles.
