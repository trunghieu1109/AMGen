Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8Tah', content='We need to count all rectangles whose vertices are among the 12 vertices of a regular 12‐gon and whose sides lie along its sides or diagonals. Any rectangle inscribed in a circle has its diagonals as diameters of the circle. The 12‐gon has 6 diameters (each connects a vertex to the opposite one). Choosing any 2 distinct diameters gives 4 endpoints that form a rectangle. There are C(6,2)=15 ways to choose 2 diameters, so there are 15 such rectangles.\n\nAnswer:15', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
