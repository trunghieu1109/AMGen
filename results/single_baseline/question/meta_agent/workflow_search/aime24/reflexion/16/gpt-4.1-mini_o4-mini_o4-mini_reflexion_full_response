Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent GGaa', content='We use vector/barycentric on the circumcircle. Let side lengths be a=BC, b=CA, c=AB, circumradius R=13, inradius r=6, and perimeter p=a+b+c. The incenter vector is I=(aA+bB+cC)/p, with A,B,C on the circle |A|=|B|=|C|=R. The condition IA⊥OI (with O the origin) gives (A–I)·I=0 ⇒ A·I=|I|^2=OI^2=R(R–2r)=13. Compute A·I=(aA·A+bA·B+cA·C)/p=R^2(a+b cos\u2009C+c cos\u2009B)/p. By the law of cosines, b cos\u2009C+c cos\u2009B=a, so A·I=R^2·2a/p. Equate to R(R–2r): 13·2a/p=13·1/p*2a=13⇒2aR=p(R–2r)=p·1 ⇒p=2aR=26a. Thus b+c=25a. The area Δ satisfies Δ=r·p/2=6·13a=78a and also Δ=abc/(4R)=bc·a/(52). Hence bc·a/52=78a ⇒bc=4056. Since AB·AC=b·c, the product is 4056.\n\nAnswer:4056', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
