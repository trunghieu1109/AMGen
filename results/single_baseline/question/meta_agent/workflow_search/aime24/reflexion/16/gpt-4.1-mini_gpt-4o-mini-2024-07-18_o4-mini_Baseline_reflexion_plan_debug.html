    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent eLNM (yourself):
We start with the given triangle ABC, where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. We know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which gives us a specific relationship between the circumradius R and the inradius r. The circumradius R is given as 13 and the inradius r is given as 6. We can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of the circumradius and inradius. The area A of triangle ABC can be expressed as A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter, and also as A = (abc) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. We can relate these quantities to find AB * AC.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent eLNM (yourself):
156

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 66DQ:
The answer provided is incorrect. To find AB * AC, we need to use the relationship between the circumradius R, inradius r, and the sides of the triangle. The condition IA ⊥ OI implies a specific relationship that can be used to derive the area and the product of the sides. The correct calculation should yield a different result.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

The relationship IA ⊥ OI implies that R^2 = r^2 + d^2, where d is the distance from I to O. We can find d using the given values of R and r, and then use the area formulas to find AB * AC.
