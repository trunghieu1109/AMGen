proposed answer: We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) suggests a special configuration. The circumradius \( R \) is 13 and the inradius \( r \) is 6. We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the excenter opposite \( A \) in the excentral triangle, or equivalently, \( A \) is the midpoint of the arc \( BC \) not containing \( A \) on the circumcircle. This means \( \angle BAI = \angle CAI \), and \( I \) is the midpoint of the arc \( BC \) containing \( A \).

We use the formula \( R^2 = OI^2 + r^2 \) for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter:
\[ OI^2 = R^2 - r^2 = 13^2 - 6^2 = 169 - 36 = 133. \]

The power of the incenter \( I \) with respect to the circumcircle is given by \( R^2 - OI^2 = 169 - 133 = 36 \). This is equal to \( IA^2 \) since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \).

Now, we use the formula for the power of the incenter:
\[ IA^2 = r^2 + 2rR \cos A. \]
Since \( IA^2 = 36 \) and \( r = 6 \), we have:
\[ 36 = 6^2 + 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 13 \cos A. \]
\[ 36 = 36 + 156 \cos A. \]
\[ 0 = 156 \cos A. \]
\[ \cos A = 0. \]

This implies \( \angle A = 90^\circ \), so \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( A \) as the right angle.

In a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse. Since \( R = 13 \), the hypotenuse \( BC = 26 \).

The area \( K \) of the triangle is given by \( K = rs = 6s \), where \( s \) is the semiperimeter. Also, \( K = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot AC \) since \( A \) is the right angle.

We have \( AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 = 26^2 = 676 \).

The semiperimeter \( s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{AB + AC + 26}{2} \).

The area \( K = 6s = 6 \cdot \frac{AB + AC + 26}{2} = 3(AB + AC + 26) \).

Equating the two expressions for \( K \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot AC = 3(AB + AC + 26). \]

Let \( x = AB \cdot AC \). Then:
\[ \frac{1}{2} x = 3(AB + AC + 26). \]
\[ x = 6(AB + AC + 26). \]

We also have \( AB^2 + AC^2 = 676 \) and \( AB \cdot AC = x \).

Using the identity \( (AB + AC)^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 + 2AB \cdot AC \), we have:
\[ (AB + AC)^2 = 676 + 2x. \]

Substitute \( x = 6(AB + AC + 26) \) into the equation:
\[ (AB + AC)^2 = 676 + 12(AB + AC + 26). \]

Let \( y = AB + AC \). Then:
\[ y^2 = 676 + 12y + 312. \]
\[ y^2 = 988 + 12y. \]
\[ y^2 - 12y - 988 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic equation for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{12^2 + 4 \cdot 988}}{2}. \]
\[ y = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 3952}}{2}. \]
\[ y = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{4096}}{2}. \]
\[ y = \frac{12 \pm 64}{2}. \]

The positive solution is \( y = \frac{76}{2} = 38 \).

Now, substitute \( y = 38 \) into \( x = 6(y + 26) \):
\[ x = 6(38 + 26) = 6 \cdot 64 = 384. \]

Thus, \( AB \cdot AC = 384 \).
