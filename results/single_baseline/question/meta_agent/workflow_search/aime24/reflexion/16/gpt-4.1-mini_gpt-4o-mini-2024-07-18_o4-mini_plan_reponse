        "response": "We start with the triangle ABC where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, we can use the relationship between the circumradius R and inradius r. The circumradius R is 13 and the inradius r is 6. We can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of R and r. The area A can be expressed as A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter, and also as A = (abc) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. We can relate these quantities to find AB * AC. The relationship IA \u22a5 OI implies that R^2 = r^2 + d^2, where d is the distance from I to O. We can find d using the given values of R and r, and then use the area formulas to find AB * AC.\n\nAnswer:156",
