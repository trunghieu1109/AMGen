    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the regular octagon and how the coloring can be invariant under these symmetries. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees). We want the coloring to be such that there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. 

First, consider the total number of ways to color the octagon. Each vertex can be either red or blue, so there are 2^8 = 256 total colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings that are invariant under some rotation. For a coloring to be invariant under a rotation by k*45 degrees, the coloring must be such that rotating the octagon by k*45 degrees results in the same coloring. This means that the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, and they must be arranged in a way that allows for such a rotation.

Let&#39;s consider the possible cases:
1. All vertices are the same color (all red or all blue). In this case, any rotation will map blue vertices to red positions and vice versa. There are 2 such colorings.
2. Half of the vertices are red and half are blue. For the octagon, this means 4 red and 4 blue. We need to count the number of such colorings that are invariant under some rotation.

For a coloring with 4 red and 4 blue vertices to be invariant under a rotation, the pattern must repeat every 4 vertices (since 8/2 = 4). This means the pattern must be of the form RRRRBBBB or some rotation of this pattern. There are 2 such patterns (RRRRBBBB and BBBBRRRR), and each can be rotated in 8 ways, but only 2 of these rotations will map blue vertices to red positions (since the pattern must be exactly half red and half blue). Therefore, there are 2*2 = 4 such colorings.

Adding these cases, we have 2 (all same color) + 4 (half and half) = 6 colorings that are invariant under some rotation.

The probability is then the number of invariant colorings divided by the total number of colorings: 6/256 = 3/128.

Thus, m = 3 and n = 128, and m + n = 131.
