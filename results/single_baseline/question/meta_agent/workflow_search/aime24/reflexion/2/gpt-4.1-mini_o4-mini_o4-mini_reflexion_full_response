Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent nVag', content='We count subsets B⊆Z/8 such that ∃k≠0 with B∩(B+k)=∅. For |B|=s≥5, 2s>8 so no k works.

What is $m+n$?\n\n### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nVag (yourself):\nWe want the probability that a random blue‐set B⊆Z_8 has some nonzero shift k for which B and B+k are disjoint.  But |B|=s and |B+k|=s, so disjointness requires 2s≤8 ⇒ s≤4.  For s≤3 every B works, giving ∑_{s=0}^3 C(8,s)=1+8+28+56=93 sets.  For s=4 we must count the 4‐subsets B whose difference set misses at least one k; by classifying gap patterns one finds exactly 18 of the C(8,4)=70 work.  No sets of size ≥5 can satisfy 2s≤8, so total “good’’ sets =93+18=111.  Thus the probability is 111/256, and m+n=111+256=367.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nVag (yourself):\n367\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 0DGa:\nThe error is in counting the s=4 cases.  One can use inclusion–exclusion over the four nontrivial rotation‐graphs G₁,G₂,G₃,G₄ and finds 22 (not 18) of the 70 four‐subsets admit a disjoint rotation.  Hence the total “good’’ subsets is 93+22=115, giving probability 115/256 and m+n=115+256=371.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
