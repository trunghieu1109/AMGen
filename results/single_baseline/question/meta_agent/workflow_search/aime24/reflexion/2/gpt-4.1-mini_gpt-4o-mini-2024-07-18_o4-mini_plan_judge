Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: To find the probability that a regular octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices occupy the positions of red vertices, we need to consider the valid configurations of blue and red vertices. The octagon has 8 vertices, and each can be colored red or blue independently. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. For the blue vertices to be able to occupy the positions of red vertices after a rotation, the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, and they must be symmetrically arranged. The valid configurations are when there are 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 blue vertices. We will calculate the number of valid configurations for each case and then find the probability by dividing the number of valid configurations by the total number of configurations. Finally, we will express the probability in the form m/n and find m+n.
