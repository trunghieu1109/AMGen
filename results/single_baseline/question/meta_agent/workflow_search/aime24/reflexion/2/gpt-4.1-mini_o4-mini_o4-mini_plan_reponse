The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

For s=4, using forbidden\u2010distance method we find exactly 22 of the 70 four\u2010subsets admit a disjoint shift. Total good=93+22=115 out of 256, so probability=115/256, hence m+n=115+256=371.\n\nAnswer:371",
