Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We count subsets B⊆Z/8 such that ∃k≠0 with B∩(B+k)=∅. For |B|=s≥5, 2s>8 so no k works. For s≤3 all sets work: 1+8+28+56=93. For s=4, using forbidden‐distance method we find exactly 22 of the 70 four‐subsets admit a disjoint shift. Total good=93+22=115 out of 256, so probability=115/256, hence m+n=115+256=371.
