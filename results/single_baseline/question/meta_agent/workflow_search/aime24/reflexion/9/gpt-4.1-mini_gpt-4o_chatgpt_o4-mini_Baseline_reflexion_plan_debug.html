    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent xC9W (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. 

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. This is given by the combination C(10, 4).

Next, calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize. She wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We need to consider the cases where she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers in the chosen set.

1. If she has exactly 2 of her numbers in the chosen set, there are C(4, 2) ways to choose which 2 of her numbers are in the set, and C(6, 2) ways to choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 numbers she did not pick.

2. If she has exactly 3 of her numbers in the chosen set, there are C(4, 3) ways to choose which 3 of her numbers are in the set, and C(6, 1) ways to choose the remaining 1 number from the 6 numbers she did not pick.

3. If she has all 4 of her numbers in the chosen set, there is exactly 1 way to choose all 4 of her numbers.

Add these cases to find the total number of ways she can win a prize.

Finally, calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is the number of ways to win the grand prize (which is 1) divided by the total number of ways to win a prize.

Simplify the resulting fraction to find m and n, and then compute m + n.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 44pX:
The solution correctly outlines the steps to solve the problem, but it does not provide the detailed calculations for each step. Let&#39;s go through the calculations: The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10, 4) = 210. To win a prize, Jen needs at least 2 of her numbers to be in the chosen set. If she has exactly 2 of her numbers in the chosen set, there are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to choose which 2 of her numbers are in the set, and C(6, 2) = 15 ways to choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 numbers she did not pick, giving 6 * 15 = 90 ways. If she has exactly 3 of her numbers in the chosen set, there are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to choose which 3 of her numbers are in the set, and C(6, 1) = 6 ways to choose the remaining 1 number from the 6 numbers she did not pick, giving 4 * 6 = 24 ways. If she has all 4 of her numbers in the chosen set, there is exactly 1 way. So, the total number of ways to win a prize is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 115, giving m + n = 116.
