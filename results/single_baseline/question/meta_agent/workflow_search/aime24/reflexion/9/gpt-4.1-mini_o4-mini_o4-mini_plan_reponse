The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We need P(match all 4 | match at least 2). Total ways to draw 4 from 10 is C(10,4)=210. The number of ways Jen matches exactly k of her 4 numbers is C(4,k)*C(6,4\u2212k). For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90; k=3:4*6=24; k=4:1*1=1. So number of prize outcomes (k\u22652) is 90+24+1=115. Grand prize outcomes (k=4) is 1. Thus the desired probability is 1/115, so m+n=1+115=116.\n\nAnswer:116",
