    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need P(match all 4 | match at least 2). Total ways to draw 4 from 10 is C(10,4)=210. The number of ways Jen matches exactly k of her 4 numbers is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90; k=3:4*6=24; k=4:1*1=1. So number of prize outcomes (k≥2) is 90+24+1=115. Grand prize outcomes (k=4) is 1. Thus the desired probability is 1/115, so m+n=1+115=116.
