    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent E2T1 (yourself):
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. We will first determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, the number of ways she can win a prize, and the number of ways she can win the grand prize. Then we will use conditional probability to find the desired result.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent E2T1 (yourself):
The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \frac{1}{35}. Therefore, m+n = 1 + 35 = 36.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent FQlK:
The calculation of the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize needs to be verified. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is correct, but the breakdown of winning a prize and winning the grand prize needs to be checked for accuracy. The final answer of m+n = 36 should be re-evaluated based on the correct calculations.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, we first need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. This is given by the binomial coefficient C(10, 4). Next, we need to determine the number of ways she can win a prize, which means at least 2 of her numbers must match the randomly chosen numbers. Finally, we need to find the number of ways she can win the grand prize, which occurs when all 4 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We will then use the formula for conditional probability to find the desired result.

Answer:The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \frac{1}{35}. Therefore, m+n = 1 + 35 = 36.</pre>
