The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, which is C(10, 4) = 210. Next, calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize. She wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. Consider the cases where she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers in the chosen set. 1. If she has exactly 2 of her numbers in the chosen set, there are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to choose which 2 of her numbers are in the set, and C(6, 2) = 15 ways to choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 numbers she did not pick, giving 6 * 15 = 90 ways. 2. If she has exactly 3 of her numbers in the chosen set, there are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to choose which 3 of her numbers are in the set, and C(6, 1) = 6 ways to choose the remaining 1 number from the 6 numbers she did not pick, giving 4 * 6 = 24 ways. 3. If she has all 4 of her numbers in the chosen set, there is exactly 1 way. So, the total number of ways to win a prize is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 115, giving m + n = 116.\n\nAnswer:116",
