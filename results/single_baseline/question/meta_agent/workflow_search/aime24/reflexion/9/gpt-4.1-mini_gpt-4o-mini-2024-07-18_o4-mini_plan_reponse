The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, we first need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. This is given by the binomial coefficient C(10, 4). Next, we need to determine the number of ways she can win a prize, which means at least 2 of her numbers must match the randomly chosen numbers. Finally, we need to find the number of ways she can win the grand prize, which occurs when all 4 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We will then use the formula for conditional probability to find the desired result.\n\nAnswer:The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \\frac{1}{35}. Therefore, m+n = 1 + 35 = 36.",
