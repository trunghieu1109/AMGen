There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the inradius of the tetrahedron, which is the distance from the point I to each of the faces. The inradius can be calculated using the formula \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} \\), where \\( V \\) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \\( S \\) is the total surface area. First, we calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the given edge lengths. The tetrahedron is symmetric, so we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths: \\( V = \\frac{1}{6} \\sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - a^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) - b^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) - c^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) + A^2B^2 + B^2C^2 + C^2A^2} \\), where \\( a = AB = \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( b = AC = \\sqrt{80} \\), \\( c = AD = \\sqrt{89} \\), \\( A = CD = \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( B = BD = \\sqrt{80} \\), \\( C = BC = \\sqrt{89} \\). Plugging in these values, we find the volume \\( V = 24 \\). Next, we calculate the area of each face using Heron's formula. The total surface area \\( S \\) is the sum of the areas of the four faces. After calculating, we find \\( S = 60 \\). Finally, we use the formula for the inradius: \\( r = \\frac{3 \\times 24}{60} = \\frac{6}{5} \\). Therefore, the inradius is \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\), which can be written as \\( \\frac{6 \\sqrt{1}}{5} \\). Thus, \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 1 \\), and \\( p = 5 \\). The sum \\( m + n + p = 6 + 1 + 5 = 12 \\).\n\nAnswer:12",
