        "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "We note that a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC) is tangential, so it has an insphere whose center is the unique point equidistant from all faces, and the inradius r satisfies V= r\u00b7S/3, where V is the volume and S the total surface area.  We compute:\n\u2022  Let p=AB=CD=\u221a41,  q=AC=BD=\u221a80,  r=AD=BC=\u221a89.  Simplify notation by u=p\u00b2=41, v=q\u00b2=80, w=r\u00b2=89.\n\u2022  Volume\u00b2 = [4uvw \u2013 u(v+w\u2013u)\u00b2 \u2013 v(w+u\u2013v)\u00b2 \u2013 w(u+v\u2013w)\u00b2 + (v+w\u2013u)(w+u\u2013v)(u+v\u2013w)]/(288).  Substituting gives numerator =409600, so V\u00b2=409600/288=12800/9, hence V=(80\u221a2)/3.\n\u2022  Each face is congruent: e.g. \u0394ABC has sides \u221a41,\u221a80,\u221a89, so its area =\u00bc\u221a(4\u00b741\u00b780 \u2013 (41+80\u201389)\u00b2) =6\u221a21.  There are 4 faces, so S=24\u221a21.\n\u2022  Thus inradius r =3V/S = (3\u00b7(80\u221a2)/3)/(24\u221a21) =80\u221a2/(24\u221a21) =10\u221a42/63.  We write this as (m\u221an)/p with m,p coprime and n squarefree: m=10, n=42, p=63.  Hence m+n+p=10+42+63=115.\n\nAnswer:115",
