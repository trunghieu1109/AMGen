Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Ntdv', content='We note that a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC) is tangential, so it has an insphere whose center is the unique point equidistant from all faces, and the inradius r satisfies V= r·S/3, where V is the volume and S the total surface area.  We compute:\n•  Let p=AB=CD=√41,  q=AC=BD=√80,  r=AD=BC=√89.  Simplify notation by u=p²=41, v=q²=80, w=r²=89.\n•  Volume² = [4uvw – u(v+w–u)² – v(w+u–v)² – w(u+v–w)² + (v+w–u)(w+u–v)(u+v–w)]/(288).  Substituting gives numerator =409600, so V²=409600/288=12800/9, hence V=(80√2)/3.\n•  Each face is congruent: e.g. ΔABC has sides √41,√80,√89, so its area =¼√(4·41·80 – (41+80–89)²) =6√21.  There are 4 faces, so S=24√21.\n•  Thus inradius r =3V/S = (3·(80√2)/3)/(24√21) =80√2/(24√21) =10√42/63.  We write this as (m√n)/p with m,p coprime and n squarefree: m=10, n=42, p=63.  Hence m+n+p=10+42+63=115.\n\nAnswer:115', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
