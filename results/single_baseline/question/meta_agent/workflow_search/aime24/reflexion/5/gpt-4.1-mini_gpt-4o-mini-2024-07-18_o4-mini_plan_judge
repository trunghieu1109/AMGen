Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: To find the distance from point I to the faces of tetrahedron ABCD, we first need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the given edge lengths. We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. Then, we will calculate the area of one of the faces and use the relationship between the volume, area, and height (distance from point I to the face) to find the required distance. The distances from point I to each face are equal, so we can express the volume in terms of the area of a face and the distance from I to that face.

Answer:The distance from point I to each face of the tetrahedron can be expressed as \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 19, n = 41, p = 5 \). Therefore, \( m+n+p = 19 + 41 + 5 = 65 \).
Extracted answer: The distance from point I to each face of the tetrahedron can be expressed as \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 19, n = 41, p = 5 \). Therefore, \( m+n+p = 19 + 41 + 5 = 65 \).
Correct answer: 104
