Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent i2BI', content='To find the distance from point I to the faces of tetrahedron ABCD, we first need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the given edge lengths. We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. Then, we will calculate the area of one of the faces and use the relationship between the volume, area, and height (distance from point I to the face) to find the required distance. The distances from point I to each face are equal, so we can express the volume in terms of the area of a face and the distance from I to that face.\n\nAnswer:The distance from point I to each face of the tetrahedron can be expressed as \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\) where \\( m = 19, n = 41, p = 5 \\). Therefore, \\( m+n+p = 19 + 41 + 5 = 65 \\).', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The distances from point I to each face are equal, which means we can express the volume in terms of the area of a face and the distance from I to that face. We will calculate the volume of tetrahedron ABCD using the given edge lengths and then find the area of one of the faces to determine the distance from I to the faces.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent i2BI (yourself):\nThe final answer is 19.\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent By7X:\nThe answer provided does not include the necessary calculations to find the distance from point I to the faces of the tetrahedron. The volume and area calculations need to be shown to arrive at the correct distance. Additionally, the final answer of 19 does not match the expected form of \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\).\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.'}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
