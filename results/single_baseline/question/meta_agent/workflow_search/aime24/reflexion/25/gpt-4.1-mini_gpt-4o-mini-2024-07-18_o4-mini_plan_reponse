        "response": "To find the side length of the equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, we can use the relationship between the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF and the hexagon itself. The triangle has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. We can apply the formula for the area of a triangle using Heron's formula and relate it to the area of the hexagon. The area of the triangle can be calculated first, and then we can use the properties of the hexagon to find the side length. The area of the triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula, and then we can relate this area to the area of the hexagon, which is a function of its side length.\n\nAnswer:The side length of the hexagon is 120.",
