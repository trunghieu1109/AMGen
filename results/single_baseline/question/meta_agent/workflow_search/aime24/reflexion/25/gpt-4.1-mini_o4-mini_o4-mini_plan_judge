Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We model the hexagon by taking its three consecutive side‐vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s, with the opposite sides then forced to be −v₁,−v₂,−v₃.  The three lines through AB, CD, EF meet in pairs to form a triangle whose sides lie respectively on directions v₁,v₃,v₂.  An affine‐regular argument shows that if one rescales a regular hexagon (side 1) so that its regular corresponding triangle of side 3 is sent to one of the triangle sides of length L, then the new hexagon side is exactly L/3.  Hence among the cyclic permutations of (200,240,300) the only choice giving an integer hexagon side s=L/3 is 240, yielding s=240/3=80.
