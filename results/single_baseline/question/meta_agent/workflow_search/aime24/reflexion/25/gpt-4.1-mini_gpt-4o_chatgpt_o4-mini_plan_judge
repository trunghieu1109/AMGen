Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral and symmetric, the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the side length of the hexagon. The triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 is a scaled version of a 3-4-5 triangle, as 200:240:300 is the same ratio as 3:4:5. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is the same as the scaling factor of the triangle. The greatest common divisor of 200, 240, and 300 is 40, so the side length of the hexagon is 40.
