        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that each row and each column can either be entirely filled with white chips, entirely filled with black chips, or be empty. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose any subset of rows to be filled with white chips and any subset of columns to be filled with black chips. However, the number of white rows must equal the number of black columns to ensure that the grid can be filled without violating the conditions. Let k be the number of rows filled with white chips (and thus the number of columns filled with black chips). k can range from 0 to 5. For each k, there are \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\) ways to choose the rows to be filled with white chips and \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\) ways to choose the columns to be filled with black chips. Therefore, the total number of ways is the sum of \\( \\binom{5}{k}^2 \\) for k from 0 to 5.\n\nAnswer:252",
