Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze how to fill the 5x5 grid with chips while adhering to the conditions that each row and each column can only contain chips of one color, and that no additional chips can be placed without violating these conditions. We can represent the configuration of the grid by determining how many rows and columns are filled with white chips and how many with black chips. Each row can either be filled with white chips, black chips, or left empty. The same applies to columns. The key is to ensure that the configuration allows for no additional chips to be placed. We can use combinatorial reasoning to count the valid configurations based on the number of rows and columns filled with chips of each color, ensuring that the color constraints are respected. We can also consider the cases where some rows and columns are empty, and how that affects the total count of configurations. After careful consideration, we can derive the total number of valid configurations.

Answer:The number of ways to place the chips is 126.
Extracted answer: The number of ways to place the chips is 126.
Correct answer: 902
