    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that each row and each column can either be entirely filled with white chips, entirely filled with black chips, or be empty. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose any subset of rows to be filled with white chips and any subset of columns to be filled with black chips. However, the number of white rows must equal the number of black columns to ensure that the grid can be filled without violating the conditions. Let k be the number of rows filled with white chips (and thus the number of columns filled with black chips). k can range from 0 to 5. For each k, there are \( \binom{5}{k} \) ways to choose the rows to be filled with white chips and \( \binom{5}{k} \) ways to choose the columns to be filled with black chips. Therefore, the total number of ways is the sum of \( \binom{5}{k}^2 \) for k from 0 to 5.
