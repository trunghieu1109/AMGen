Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent NKSe', content='We need maximal placements satisfying that chips in each row/column are same color and no further chip can be added without violating this. One shows that in a maximal configuration every row and every column must already contain at least one chip, so each row and column has an assigned color and cells (r,c) are occupied iff row r and column c have the same color. Denote R_w = number of white rows, C_w = number of white columns. To be maximal, if R_w=0 then C_w=0 (all black), if R_w=5 then C_w=5 (all white), otherwise both R_w and C_w lie in {1,…,4}. The number of colorings is\n sum_{R_w=0..5} binom(5,R_w)*#choices of columns:\n– R_w=0 or 5: only C_w=R_w valid ⇒ contribution 2*1=2\n– R_w=1..4: row choices =binom(5,R_w), column choices = sum_{j=1..4} binom(5,j)=30 ⇒ total for these =30*30=900\nHence total =900+2=902.\n\nAnswer:902', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
