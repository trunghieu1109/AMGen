Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume, we start by letting the dimensions of the box be denoted as x, y, and z. The surface area S and volume V of the box are given by the equations S = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 and V = xyz = 23. The radius r of the sphere that can contain the box is given by r = sqrt((x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/3). We need to minimize r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/3 under the constraints of the surface area and volume. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers or inequalities, we can derive the necessary conditions to find the minimum value of r^2. After applying the appropriate inequalities and solving the equations, we find that r^2 = 6. Therefore, we express r^2 as a fraction and find p and q such that they are relatively prime.

Answer:The value of r^2 can be expressed as \frac{138}{23} where p = 138 and q = 23. Thus, p + q = 161.
Extracted answer: The value of r^2 can be expressed as \frac{138}{23} where p = 138 and q = 23. Thus, p + q = 161.
Correct answer: 721
