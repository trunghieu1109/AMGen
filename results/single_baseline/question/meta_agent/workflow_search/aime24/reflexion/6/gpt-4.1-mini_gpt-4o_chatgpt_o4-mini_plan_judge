Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangular box that maximize the diagonal, as the smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half of this diagonal. Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, and z. The surface area condition gives us 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume condition gives us xyz = 23. We need to maximize the diagonal d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}. Using the surface area condition, we have xy + yz + zx = 27. We can express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of xy + yz + zx and xyz using the identity (x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx). Let s = x + y + z. Then s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 54. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54. We also have xyz = 23. To maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we need to find the maximum value of s^2 - 54 given the constraints. Using the AM-GM inequality, \frac{x+y+z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} = \sqrt[3]{23}, so x+y+z \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}. By trial and error or by solving the system of equations, we find that x = 3, y = 3, and z = \frac{23}{9} satisfy the conditions. The diagonal is then d = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2 + \left(\frac{23}{9}\right)^2}. Calculating this gives d = \sqrt{9 + 9 + \frac{529}{81}} = \sqrt{18 + \frac{529}{81}}. Simplifying, we find d = \sqrt{\frac{1458 + 529}{81}} = \sqrt{\frac{1987}{81}}. The radius r of the sphere is \frac{d}{2}, so r^2 = \frac{1987}{324}. The integers p and q are 1987 and 324, respectively, and they are relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 1987 + 324 = 2311.
