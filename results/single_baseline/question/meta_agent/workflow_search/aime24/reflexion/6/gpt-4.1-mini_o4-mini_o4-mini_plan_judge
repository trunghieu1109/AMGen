Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest sphere that contains every rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Any box has side lengths x,y,z>0 satisfying xy+yz+zx=27 and xyz=23. The minimal containing sphere has radius r=½√(x^2+y^2+z^2), so r^2=(x^2+y^2+z^2)/4. We seek the maximum of D^2=x^2+y^2+z^2 under the constraints.

By symmetry, the extreme occurs when two sides are equal, say x=y=a and z=b. Then the constraints become:
1) a^2+2ab=27
2) a^2b=23.

From (2), b=23/a^2. Plugging into (1): a^2 + 46/a =27 ⇒ a^3−27a+46=0. Testing integer roots gives a=2, and the other positive root a=−1+2√6≈3.898. The corresponding b’s are 23/4=5.75 and ≈1.513. 

Compute D^2 for both:
• a=2, b=5.75 ⇒ D^2=2·2^2+(5.75)^2=8+33.0625=41.0625 =657/16.
• a≈3.898, b≈1.513 ⇒ D^2≈32.668 (<41.0625).

Thus the maximum D^2 is 657/16, so r^2=D^2/4=657/64. Hence p+q=657+64=721.
