        "response": "We need the smallest sphere that contains every rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Any box has side lengths x,y,z>0 satisfying xy+yz+zx=27 and xyz=23. The minimal containing sphere has radius r=\u00bd\u221a(x^2+y^2+z^2), so r^2=(x^2+y^2+z^2)/4. We seek the maximum of D^2=x^2+y^2+z^2 under the constraints.\n\nBy symmetry, the extreme occurs when two sides are equal, say x=y=a and z=b. Then the constraints become:\n1) a^2+2ab=27\n2) a^2b=23.\n\nFrom (2), b=23/a^2. Plugging into (1): a^2 + 46/a =27 \u21d2 a^3\u221227a+46=0. Testing integer roots gives a=2, and the other positive root a=\u22121+2\u221a6\u22483.898. The corresponding b\u2019s are 23/4=5.75 and \u22481.513. \n\nCompute D^2 for both:\n\u2022 a=2, b=5.75 \u21d2 D^2=2\u00b72^2+(5.75)^2=8+33.0625=41.0625 =657/16.\n\u2022 a\u22483.898, b\u22481.513 \u21d2 D^2\u224832.668 (<41.0625).\n\nThus the maximum D^2 is 657/16, so r^2=D^2/4=657/64. Hence p+q=657+64=721.\n\nAnswer:721",
