    <pre>Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gMEB (yourself):
We start with the given system of equations. We can rewrite each logarithmic equation in exponential form to express the relationships between x, y, and z. Then we can manipulate these equations to find the values of x, y, and z in terms of a common variable. Finally, we will compute the value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| and simplify it to find m and n.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent repO:
The answer provided does not show the detailed steps taken to arrive at the final result. It is important to derive the values of x, y, and z from the logarithmic equations and then compute |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| explicitly to ensure accuracy. The final answer should be verified against the calculations.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We start with the given logarithmic equations and convert them into exponential form. From the first equation, we have x = 2^(1/2) * yz. From the second equation, we have y = 2^(1/3) * xz. From the third equation, we have z = 2^(1/4) * xy. We can express x, y, and z in terms of a common variable and then substitute to find their relationships. After finding x, y, and z, we will compute |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| and simplify it to find m and n.
