        "response": "We start with the given logarithmic equations and convert them into exponential form. From the first equation, we have x = 2^(1/2) * yz. From the second equation, we have y = 2^(1/3) * xz. From the third equation, we have z = 2^(1/4) * xy. We can express x, y, and z in terms of a common variable and then substitute to find their relationships. After finding x, y, and z, we will compute |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| and simplify it to find m and n.\n\nAnswer:19",
