Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mDF3', content='Let A=log2x, B=log2y, C=log2z. The equations become A−B−C=1/2, B−A−C=1/3, C−A−B=1/4. Adding all gives −(A+B+C)=13/12, so A+B+C=−13/12. Adding the first two: −2C=1/2+1/3=5/6 ⇒ C=−5/12. Adding the first and third: −2B=1/2+1/4=3/4 ⇒ B=−3/8. Adding the second and third: −2A=1/3+1/4=7/12 ⇒ A=−7/24. Then log2(x^4y^3z^2)=4A+3B+2C=(−28−27−20)/24=−75/24=−25/8, so its absolute value is 25/8. Thus m=25,n=8 and m+n=33.\n\nAnswer:33', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
