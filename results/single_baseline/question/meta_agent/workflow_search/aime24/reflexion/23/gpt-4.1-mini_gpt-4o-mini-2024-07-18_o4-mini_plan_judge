Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the conditions given for the 2x3 grid. The grid can be represented as follows: | a1 | a2 | a3 | | b1 | b2 | b3 |. The conditions we need to satisfy are: 1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, which translates to: a1 * 100 + a2 * 10 + a3 + b1 * 100 + b2 * 10 + b3 = 999. 2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, which translates to: a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + a3 + b3 = 99. We can express the first condition as: a1 + b1 = 9, a2 + b2 = 9, a3 + b3 = 9. This means that each pair of digits in the same column must sum to 9. The second condition simplifies to: a1 + a2 + a3 + b1 + b2 + b3 = 99. Given that each column sums to 9, we can deduce that the total sum of all digits in the grid is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, which contradicts the requirement that their total should be 99. Therefore, there are no valid arrangements of digits that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Thus, the number of ways to place the digits in the grid is 0.
