Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We have a 2x3 grid where we need to place digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \]

The conditions are:
1. The sum of the numbers formed by the rows: \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\).
2. The sum of the numbers formed by the columns: \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), \(c + f = 81\).

From the second condition, we have:
- \(a + d = 9\)
- \(b + e = 9\)
- \(c + f = 81\)

From the first condition, we have:
\(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\).

Substituting \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 81 - c\) into the first condition, we get:

\[100a + 10b + c + 100(9-a) + 10(9-b) + (81-c) = 999\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[100a + 10b + c + 900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 81 - c = 999\]

This simplifies to:
\[1071 = 999\]

This is a contradiction, indicating that there is no solution that satisfies both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no ways to place the digits in the grid to satisfy both conditions.
