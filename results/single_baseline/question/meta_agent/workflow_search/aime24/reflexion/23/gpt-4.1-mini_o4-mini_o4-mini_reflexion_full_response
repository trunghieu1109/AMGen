Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sk9M', content='Let the grid be [[a,b,c],[d,e,f]]. Row sums give 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999 ⇒ A=a+d, B=b+e, C=c+f satisfy 100A+10B+C=999 and A+B+C=x+y where x=a+b+c, y=d+e+f. Column sums give 10x+y=99 ⇒ (x,y)=(8,19). Then A+B+C=27 and 100A+10B+C=999 forces (A,B,C)=(9,9,9). So a+d=b+e=c+f=9 and a+b+c=8. For any nonnegative a,b,c≤9 with sum 8 (C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45), set d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c. All are digits. Hence 45 ways.\n\nAnswer:45', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
