The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",

        "response": "Let the grid be [[a,b,c],[d,e,f]]. Row sums give 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999 \u21d2 A=a+d, B=b+e, C=c+f satisfy 100A+10B+C=999 and A+B+C=x+y where x=a+b+c, y=d+e+f. Column sums give 10x+y=99 \u21d2 (x,y)=(8,19). Then A+B+C=27 and 100A+10B+C=999 forces (A,B,C)=(9,9,9). So a+d=b+e=c+f=9 and a+b+c=8. For any nonnegative a,b,c\u22649 with sum 8 (C(8+3\u22121,2)=C(10,2)=45), set d=9\u2212a, e=9\u2212b, f=9\u2212c. All are digits. Hence 45 ways.\n\nAnswer:45",
