        "response": "We start with the equations given: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). Rewriting these logarithmic equations in exponential form gives us two equations: \\( y^x = x^{10} \\) and \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\). From the first equation, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\): \\( y = x^{10/x} \\). Substituting this into the second equation allows us to find a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). After substituting and simplifying, we can solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to find their product \\( xy \\).\n\nAnswer:xy = 100",
