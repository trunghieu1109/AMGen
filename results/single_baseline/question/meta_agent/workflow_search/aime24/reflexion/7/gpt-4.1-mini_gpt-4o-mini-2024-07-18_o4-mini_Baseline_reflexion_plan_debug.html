    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent I5lT (yourself):
We start with the equations given: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form. From the first equation, we have \( y^x = x^{10} \). From the second equation, we have \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Now we have two equations: \( y^x = x^{10} \) and \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). We can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to find a relationship between x and y. Let&#39;s solve these equations step by step.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent I5lT (yourself):
xy = 100

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent XtIK:
The solution provided does not show the steps taken to arrive at the answer, making it difficult to verify its correctness. Additionally, the equations derived from the logarithmic expressions need to be solved systematically to ensure accuracy. The final answer should be checked against the derived equations to confirm if it satisfies both conditions.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We start with the equations given: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Rewriting these logarithmic equations in exponential form gives us two equations: \( y^x = x^{10} \) and \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \): \( y = x^{10/x} \). Substituting this into the second equation allows us to find a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). After substituting and simplifying, we can solve for \( x \) and \( y \) to find their product \( xy \).

Answer:xy = 100</pre>
