proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We need to find the product \( xy \).

First, consider the equation \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This implies:
\[ y^x = x^{10}. \]

Next, consider the equation \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). This implies:
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10}. \]

We have the system of equations:
1. \( y^x = x^{10} \)
2. \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \)

From the first equation, \( y^x = x^{10} \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = x^{10/x}. \]

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into the second equation:
\[ x^{4y} = (x^{10/x})^{10}. \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ x^{4y} = x^{100/x}. \]

Now, equate the exponents from both sides of the second equation:
\[ 4y = \frac{100}{x}. \]

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into \( 4y = \frac{100}{x} \):
\[ 4x^{10/x} = \frac{100}{x}. \]

Multiply both sides by \( x \):
\[ 4x^{10/x + 1} = 100. \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x^{10/x + 1} = 25. \]

Take the logarithm of both sides:
\[ \left(\frac{10}{x} + 1\right) \log x = \log 25. \]

Let \( \log x = a \). Then:
\[ \left(\frac{10}{x} + 1\right) a = \log 25. \]

We also have \( y = x^{10/x} \), so \( \log y = \frac{10}{x} a \).

From the second equation \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \), we have:
\[ 4y \log x = 10 \log y. \]

Substitute \( \log y = \frac{10}{x} a \):
\[ 4 \cdot \frac{10}{x} a \cdot a = 10 \cdot \frac{10}{x} a. \]

Simplify:
\[ 40a^2 = 100a. \]

Divide by 20:
\[ 2a^2 = 5a. \]

Divide by \( a \) (assuming \( a \neq 0 \)):
\[ 2a = 5. \]

Thus, \( a = \frac{5}{2} \).

Since \( a = \log x \), we have \( x = 10^{5/2} = 100^{1/2} = 10^{5/2} \).

Now, find \( y \):
\[ y = x^{10/x} = (10^{5/2})^{10/(10^{5/2})}. \]

Simplify:
\[ y = 10^{5/2}. \]

Thus, \( x = y = 10^{5/2} \).

Finally, find \( xy \):
\[ xy = 10^{5/2} \cdot 10^{5/2} = 10^5. \]
