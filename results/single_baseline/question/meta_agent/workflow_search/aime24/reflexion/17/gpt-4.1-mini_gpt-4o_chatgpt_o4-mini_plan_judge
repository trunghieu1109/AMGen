proposed answer: We are given two equations involving nonnegative integers a, b, and c. The first equation is a + b + c = 300, and the second is a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. 

First, let's analyze the second equation. It can be rewritten as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substituting these into the second equation gives:

a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

This equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, so we can assume without loss of generality that a <= b <= c. This assumption will help us reduce the number of cases to consider.

Now, let's try some small values for a, b, and c to see if we can find any solutions. Since a + b + c = 300, if a is small, b and c will be large, and vice versa. We can start by trying a = 100, b = 100, c = 100, since this is a symmetric case.

For a = b = c = 100, we have:
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) = 3 * 100^2 * 200 = 6,000,000.

This satisfies the second equation, and a + b + c = 300 satisfies the first equation. Therefore, (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

Since the equation is symmetric, any permutation of (100, 100, 100) is also a solution. However, since all three numbers are the same, there is only one unique triple (100, 100, 100).

Thus, there is exactly 1 triple of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfies both equations.
