        "response": "To find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations, we start with the first equation a + b + c = 300. This gives us a constraint on the total sum of a, b, and c. The second equation involves a quadratic form of these variables. We can express the second equation in terms of the first and analyze the possible values for a, b, and c. We can also use the method of generating functions or combinatorial counting to find the solutions. However, we need to ensure that the quadratic equation is satisfied while keeping the sum constant. After analyzing the equations, we find that the only valid solution is when one of the variables is 0 and the others are adjusted accordingly to meet both equations. This leads us to conclude that there are no valid triples that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nAnswer:0",
