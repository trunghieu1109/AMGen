Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VFtG', content='We need ordered nonnegative (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and sum_{i≠j} a_i^2 a_j=6·10^6.  Write c=k, s=a+b=300−k.  One checks the condition becomes ab(300−3k)=300[(k−100)(k−200)], so for k≠100 one gets ab=100(200−k) and the quadratic t^2−st+ab=0 has integer roots (a,b)=(100,200−k) or its swap.  This gives 2 solutions for each k=0…200 except k=100, i.e. 200·2=400.  For k=100 the factor 300−3k vanishes and one gets any a+b=200, giving 201 solutions.  No solutions for k>200.  Total=400+201=601.\n\nAnswer:601', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
