    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YuIj (yourself):
To find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is resting on the sphere, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation. The torus has a major radius of 6 (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and a minor radius of 3 (the radius of the tube). The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the torus. We can find the inner and outer radii of the circles of tangency by considering the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The inner radius corresponds to the case where the torus is resting on the sphere, and the outer radius corresponds to the case where the torus is above the sphere. The difference between these two radii will give us the required value.

14

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent eFGq:
The answer provided does not correctly calculate the difference between the inner and outer radii of the circles of tangency. The correct approach involves determining the distances from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency on the torus, taking into account the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The major radius of the torus is 6 and the minor radius is 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The calculations need to be carefully performed to find the correct values for r_i and r_o, and then their difference should be computed accurately.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

The inner radius corresponds to the case where the torus is resting on the sphere, and the outer radius corresponds to the case where the torus is above the sphere. The inner radius r_i is calculated as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the minor radius of the torus, which is 11 + 3 = 14. The outer radius r_o is calculated as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the minor radius of the torus, which is 11 - 3 = 8. The difference r_i - r_o is then 14 - 8 = 6. The difference can be expressed as 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
