        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We set up a coordinate system with the sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin and the torus of tube\u2010radius a=3 and center\u2010circle radius R=6 whose axis is the z\u2010axis.  Shifting the torus upward by H, its surface is given in cylindrical coords (\u03c1,z) by (\u03c1\u22126)^2+(z\u2212H)^2=9, while the sphere is \u03c1^2+z^2=121.  At a point of external tangency their normals are parallel, giving \u03c1H=6z.  Solving the system yields H^2+36=D with D=196 or 64, so the contact\u2010circle radii satisfy \u03c1^2=4356/D.  Thus \u03c1=33/7\u22484.714 or \u03c1=33/4=8.25.  The two cases correspond to the two ways the torus can rest on the sphere.  The difference of the two contact radii in positive form is 33/4\u221233/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127",
