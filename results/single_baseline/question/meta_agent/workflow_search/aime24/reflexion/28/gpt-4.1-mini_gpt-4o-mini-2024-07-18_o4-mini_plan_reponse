        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is resting on the sphere, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation. The torus has a major radius of 6 (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and a minor radius of 3 (the radius of the tube). The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the torus. The inner radius corresponds to the case where the torus is resting on the sphere, and the outer radius corresponds to the case where the torus is above the sphere. The inner radius r_i is calculated as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the minor radius of the torus, which is 11 + 3 = 14. The outer radius r_o is calculated as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the minor radius of the torus, which is 11 - 3 = 8. The difference r_i - r_o is then 14 - 8 = 6. The difference can be expressed as 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnswer:7",
