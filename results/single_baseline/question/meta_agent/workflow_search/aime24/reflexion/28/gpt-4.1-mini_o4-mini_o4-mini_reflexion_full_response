Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lQ2W', content='We set up a coordinate system with the sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin and the torus of tube‐radius a=3 and center‐circle radius R=6 whose axis is the z‐axis.  Shifting the torus upward by H, its surface is given in cylindrical coords (ρ,z) by (ρ−6)^2+(z−H)^2=9, while the sphere is ρ^2+z^2=121.  At a point of external tangency their normals are parallel, giving ρH=6z.  Solving the system yields H^2+36=D with D=196 or 64, so the contact‐circle radii satisfy ρ^2=4356/D.  Thus ρ=33/7≈4.714 or ρ=33/4=8.25.  The two cases correspond to the two ways the torus can rest on the sphere.  The difference of the two contact radii in positive form is 33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
