    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4wUb (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The center of the torus is 6 units from the axis of revolution, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 14 - 6 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is 3. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 8 + 6 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is 3. The difference in the radii of the circles of tangency is 3 - 3 = 0. However, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me correct it. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 14 - 6 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency is 8 - 6 = 2. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 8 + 6 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency is 14 - 6 = 8. The difference in the radii of the circles of tangency is 8 - 2 = 6. The difference r_i - r_o is 6, which can be written as 6/1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 7.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent zYpI:
The reasoning contains errors. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14, which is correct. However, the radius of the circle of tangency is not calculated correctly. The correct radius of the circle of tangency is 14 - 6 = 8. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8, which is correct. However, the radius of the circle of tangency is not calculated correctly. The correct radius of the circle of tangency is 6 - 8 = -2, which is not possible, indicating a mistake in the reasoning. The correct approach is to consider the geometry of the torus and sphere more carefully.
