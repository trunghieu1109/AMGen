Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: To find the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola, we start by noting the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus. The hyperbola can be parametrized as x = sqrt(20) cosh(t), y = sqrt(24) sinh(t). The vertices A, B, C, and D can be expressed in terms of these parameters. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, meaning we can express the coordinates of the vertices in terms of hyperbolic functions. The length of the diagonal BD can be derived from the coordinates of points B and D. By analyzing the resulting expressions for BD^2, we can find its maximum value. After performing the necessary calculations, we find that the maximum value of BD^2 approaches 48 as the parameters vary. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 48.
