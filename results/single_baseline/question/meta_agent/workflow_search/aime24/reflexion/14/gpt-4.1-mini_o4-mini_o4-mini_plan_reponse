        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "We parameterize points A and B as A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2) on the hyperbola x^2/20 \u2013 y^2/24=1. A rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin has C=(\u2013x1,\u2013y1), D=(\u2013x2,\u2013y2), and equal sides iff AC\u22a5BD, i.e. x1x2+y1y2=0. For any valid B, BD^2 =4(x2^2+y2^2). Existence of A on the perpendicular through the origin requires that the line y=\u2013(x2/y2)x intersects the hyperbola, giving the condition y2^2>600/11 and x2^2=(120+5y2^2)/6>720/11. Thus BD^2>4(720/11+600/11)=5280/11=480, and this bound can be approached arbitrarily closely but never reached. Hence the greatest lower bound of BD^2 is 480.\n\nAnswer:480",
