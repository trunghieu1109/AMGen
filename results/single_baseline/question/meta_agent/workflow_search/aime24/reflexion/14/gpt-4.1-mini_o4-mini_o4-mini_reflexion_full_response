Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent uP7j', content='We parameterize points A and B as A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2) on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24=1. A rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin has C=(–x1,–y1), D=(–x2,–y2), and equal sides iff AC⊥BD, i.e. x1x2+y1y2=0. For any valid B, BD^2 =4(x2^2+y2^2). Existence of A on the perpendicular through the origin requires that the line y=–(x2/y2)x intersects the hyperbola, giving the condition y2^2>600/11 and x2^2=(120+5y2^2)/6>720/11. Thus BD^2>4(720/11+600/11)=5280/11=480, and this bound can be approached arbitrarily closely but never reached. Hence the greatest lower bound of BD^2 is 480.\n\nAnswer:480', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
