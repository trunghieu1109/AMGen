Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let the diagonals be along the coordinate axes for simplicity. Assume the vertices of the rhombus are \((a, b), (-a, -b), (c, d), (-c, -d)\). The diagonals are \(2a\) and \(2c\), and they intersect at the origin. The condition for the points to lie on the hyperbola gives us two equations: \(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{c^2}{20} - \frac{d^2}{24} = 1\). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, we have \(ab + cd = 0\). We want to maximize \(BD^2 = 4c^2\). By symmetry and the properties of the hyperbola, the maximum occurs when the points are on the axes, i.e., \(b = 0\) and \(d = 0\). Then \(a^2 = 20\) and \(c^2 = 24\). Thus, \(BD^2 = 4c^2 = 96\). The greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) is 95.
