Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To find the point C on the line segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family F, we first need to determine the equation of the line segment AB. The coordinates of A and B are given as A=(1/2, 0) and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of line AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line can be expressed as y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2) = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. We can express points on this line segment parametrically as C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)t/2) for t in [0, 1]. Next, we analyze the segments of unit length that can be formed with points on the x-axis and y-axis. A segment from (x, 0) to (0, y) has length sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1, which gives us the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1. We need to find the conditions under which a point C(t) does not belong to any such segment. This leads us to find the specific t that satisfies the conditions. After some calculations, we find that OC^2 = (1/2 - t/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)t/2)^2. Simplifying this expression leads us to OC^2 = 7/4, where p = 7 and q = 4 are coprime integers. Therefore, p + q = 11.
