    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). First, we find the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A and B are \(A=\left(\frac{1}{2},0\right)\) and \(B=\left(0,\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of AB is \(-\sqrt{3}\), so the equation of line AB is \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \(C = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) for \(0 &lt; t &lt; 1\). For a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, let P be \((x, 0)\) and Q be \((0, y)\) with \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). The line through P and Q is \(y = -\frac{y}{x}x + y\). For C to not lie on any such line other than AB, the slope of line PQ must not equal the slope of AB, which is \(-\sqrt{3}\). Therefore, \(-\frac{y}{x} = -\sqrt{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{x} = \sqrt{3}\). Substituting \(y = \sqrt{3}x\) into \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), we get \(x^2 + 3x^2 = 1\), so \(x^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Thus, the only segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with slope \(-\sqrt{3}\) is \(\overline{AB}\) itself. Therefore, C is the point on AB where the slope condition is met, which is the midpoint of AB. The coordinates of C are \(\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). The distance OC is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Thus, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), so \(p+q = 5\).
