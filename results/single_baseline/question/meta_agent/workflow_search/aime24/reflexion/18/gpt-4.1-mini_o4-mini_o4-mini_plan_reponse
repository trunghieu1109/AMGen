        "response": "We seek the unique point C on AB not covered by any other unit\u2010length segment from the x\u2013axis to the y\u2013axis besides AB itself.  Parameterize AB: A=(\u00bd,0), B=(0,\u221a3/2), so AB has equation y=\u2212\u221a3 x+\u221a3/2.  The family of unit segments from P=(t,0) to Q=(0,\u221a{1\u2212t\u00b2}) has envelope given by Y=(1\u2212X^{2/3})^{3/2}.  Intersecting this envelope with the line of AB yields (after solving) X=1/8, Y=3\u221a3/8.  Hence C=(1/8,3\u221a3/8) and OC\u00b2=(1/8)\u00b2+(3\u221a3/8)\u00b2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16.  Thus p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23",
