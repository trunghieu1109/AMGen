Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We seek the unique point C on AB not covered by any other unit‐length segment from the x–axis to the y–axis besides AB itself.  Parameterize AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2), so AB has equation y=−√3 x+√3/2.  The family of unit segments from P=(t,0) to Q=(0,√{1−t²}) has envelope given by Y=(1−X^{2/3})^{3/2}.  Intersecting this envelope with the line of AB yields (after solving) X=1/8, Y=3√3/8.  Hence C=(1/8,3√3/8) and OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16.  Thus p+q=7+16=23.
