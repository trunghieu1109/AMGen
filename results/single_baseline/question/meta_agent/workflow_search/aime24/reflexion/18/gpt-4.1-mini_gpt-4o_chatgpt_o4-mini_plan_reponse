        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). First, we find the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A and B are \\(A=\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0\\right)\\) and \\(B=\\left(0,\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\). The slope of AB is \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\), so the equation of line AB is \\(y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \\(C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)\\) for \\(0 < t < 1\\). For a segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, let P be \\((x, 0)\\) and Q be \\((0, y)\\) with \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\). The line through P and Q is \\(y = -\\frac{y}{x}x + y\\). For C to not lie on any such line other than AB, the slope of line PQ must not equal the slope of AB, which is \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, \\(-\\frac{y}{x} = -\\sqrt{3}\\) implies \\(\\frac{y}{x} = \\sqrt{3}\\). Substituting \\(y = \\sqrt{3}x\\) into \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), we get \\(x^2 + 3x^2 = 1\\), so \\(x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). Thus, the only segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with slope \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(\\overline{AB}\\) itself. Therefore, C is the point on AB where the slope condition is met, which is the midpoint of AB. The coordinates of C are \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)\\). The distance OC is \\(\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{3}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(OC^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Thus, \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 4\\), so \\(p+q = 5\\).\n\nAnswer:5",
