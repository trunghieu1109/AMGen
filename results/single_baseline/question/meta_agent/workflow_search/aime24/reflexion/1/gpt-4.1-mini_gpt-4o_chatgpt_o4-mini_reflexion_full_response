Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FhuH', content="We are given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $\\omega$ with tangents at $B$ and $C$ intersecting at $D$. We need to find the length of $AP$ where $P$ is the second intersection of line $AD$ with the circle. We use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. The power of point $D$ with respect to the circle is $DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \\cdot DP$. Since $D$ is the intersection of tangents, $DB = DC$. By the Power of a Point theorem, $DA \\cdot DP = DB^2$. We use the fact that $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$ to find the circumradius $R$ of the triangle using the formula $R = \\frac{abc}{4K}$, where $K$ is the area of the triangle. We find $K$ using Heron's formula. Once we have $R$, we can find $DB = DC = \\frac{2R \\cdot AB \\cdot AC}{AB + AC}$.

However, the calculation of the circumradius and the application of the Power of a Point theorem need to be checked for accuracy. The final answer should be verified by ensuring all steps are correctly followed.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
