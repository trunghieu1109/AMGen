Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To find the length of segment AP, we will use the power of a point theorem and the properties of tangents to a circle. First, we need to calculate the circumradius R of triangle ABC using the formula R = abc / (4K), where K is the area of triangle ABC. We can find K using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s is calculated as s = (AB + BC + AC) / 2 = (5 + 9 + 10) / 2 = 12. Then, we can find K using K = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. After calculating K, we can find R. Next, we will find the lengths of the tangents from point D to points B and C, which are equal to the lengths of the segments from D to the points of tangency. Finally, we will apply the power of a point theorem to find AP, which is given by the relationship AD * AP = DB^2 = DC^2, where DB and DC are the lengths of the tangents from D to B and C respectively. We will express AP in the form m/n and find m+n.
