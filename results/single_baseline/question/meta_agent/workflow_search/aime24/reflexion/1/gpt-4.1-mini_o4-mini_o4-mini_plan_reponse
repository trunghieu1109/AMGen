        "response": "We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0).  Then A=(1/3,4\u221a14/3) so that AB=5, AC=10.  The circumcenter works out to O=(9/2,33/(4\u221a14)) with R=75/(4\u221a14).  The tangents at B and C meet at D=(9/2,\u221227\u221a14/11).  Compute DA=325/22 and DB (the tangent length)=225/22.  By the tangent\u2010secant power theorem, DP\u00b7DA=DB\u00b2 \u21d2 DP=(DB)\u00b2/DA=2025/286.  Since P lies between A and D, AP=DA\u2212DP=325/22\u22122025/286=1100/143=100/13, so m+n=100+13=113.\n\nAnswer:113",
