    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Roo1 (yourself):
To find the length of segment AP, we will use the power of a point theorem and the properties of tangents to a circle. The power of point D with respect to circle Ï‰ gives us a relationship between the segments AD and AP. We will first calculate the circumradius R of triangle ABC using the formula R = abc / (4K), where K is the area of triangle ABC. We will then find the length of AD using the tangent segments from point D to points B and C, and finally apply the power of a point theorem to find AP.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Roo1 (yourself):
17

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent hNOW:
The answer provided does not include the necessary calculations or reasoning to arrive at the final result of AP. The circumradius and area calculations need to be explicitly shown, and the application of the power of a point theorem should be detailed. Additionally, the final answer should be expressed in the form m/n, and the sum m+n should be calculated correctly.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>To find the length of segment AP, we will use the power of a point theorem and the properties of tangents to a circle. First, we need to calculate the circumradius R of triangle ABC using the formula R = abc / (4K), where K is the area of triangle ABC. We can find K using Heron&#39;s formula. The semi-perimeter s is calculated as s = (AB + BC + AC) / 2 = (5 + 9 + 10) / 2 = 12. Then, we can find K using K = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. After calculating K, we can find R. Next, we will find the lengths of the tangents from point D to points B and C, which are equal to the lengths of the segments from D to the points of tangency. Finally, we will apply the power of a point theorem to find AP, which is given by the relationship AD * AP = DB^2 = DC^2, where DB and DC are the lengths of the tangents from D to B and C respectively. We will express AP in the form m/n and find m+n.
