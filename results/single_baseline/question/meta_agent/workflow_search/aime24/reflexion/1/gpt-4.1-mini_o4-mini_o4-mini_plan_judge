Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0).  Then A=(1/3,4√14/3) so that AB=5, AC=10.  The circumcenter works out to O=(9/2,33/(4√14)) with R=75/(4√14).  The tangents at B and C meet at D=(9/2,−27√14/11).  Compute DA=325/22 and DB (the tangent length)=225/22.  By the tangent‐secant power theorem, DP·DA=DB² ⇒ DP=(DB)²/DA=2025/286.  Since P lies between A and D, AP=DA−DP=325/22−2025/286=1100/143=100/13, so m+n=100+13=113.
