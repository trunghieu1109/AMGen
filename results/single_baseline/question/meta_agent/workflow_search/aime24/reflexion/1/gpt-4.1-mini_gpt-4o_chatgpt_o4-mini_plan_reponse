        "response": "We are given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $\\omega$ with tangents at $B$ and $C$ intersecting at $D$. We need to find the length of $AP$ where $P$ is the second intersection of line $AD$ with the circle. We use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. The power of point $D$ with respect to the circle is $DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \\cdot DP$. Since $D$ is the intersection of tangents, $DB = DC$. By the Power of a Point theorem, $DA \\cdot DP = DB^2$. We use the fact that $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$ to find the circumradius $R$ of the triangle using the formula $R = \\frac{abc}{4K}$, where $K$ is the area of the triangle. We find $K$ using Heron's formula. Once we have $R$, we can find $DB = DC = \\frac{2R \\cdot AB \\cdot AC}{AB + AC}$. Finally, we solve for $AP$ using the relation $DA \\cdot DP = DB^2$ and express $AP$ in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime integers, and find $m + n$.\n\nAnswer:34",
