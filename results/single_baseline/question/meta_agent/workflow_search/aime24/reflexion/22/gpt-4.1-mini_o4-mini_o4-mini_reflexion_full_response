Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6UpR', content='We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and an even-length list so the median=(two middle terms)/2 is an integer not in the list.  For n=2 no 9’s can appear, so ignore. For n=4 let the sorted list be a1≤a2≤a3≤a4, a total 30, median=(a2+a3)/2≡m an integer m∉{a1,a2,a3,a4}, and 9 must appear more times than any other entry.  If exactly two 9’s, they cannot occupy both middle positions (or median=9∈list), so place them in positions 3&4: a3=a4=9 ⇒ a1+a2=12.  Then median=(a2+9)/2 integer ⇒ a2 odd.  Testing a2=7⇒a1=5 gives [5,7,9,9], median=(7+9)/2=8 (not in list), 9 appears twice, others once, sum 30.  Sum of squares=5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.  For n=6 or higher the small entries force ties in frequency or non-integer or forbidden medians.  Hence the unique solution is [5,7,9,9] and its sum of squares is 236.\n\nAnswer:236', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
