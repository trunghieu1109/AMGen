    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions. Let&#39;s denote the list as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \). The conditions are: 1) The sum of the items is 30. 2) The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. 3) The median is a positive integer not in the list. 

First, let&#39;s consider the mode condition. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears \( k \) times, where \( k &gt; 1 \). 

Next, consider the median condition. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If it has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Since the median is not in the list, it suggests the list has an even number of elements, say \( 2m \). The median would then be the average of the \( m \)-th and \( (m+1) \)-th elements. 

Let&#39;s try constructing a list. Suppose the list has 6 elements (an even number). The sum of the list is 30, and 9 is the mode. Let&#39;s try: \( 5, 7, 9, 9, 9, x \). The sum is \( 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 + x = 30 \), so \( x = 30 - 39 = -9 \), which is not possible. 

Let&#39;s try another configuration: \( 6, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10 \). The sum is \( 6 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 51 \), which is too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 6, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10 \). The sum is \( 6 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 50 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 5, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10 \). The sum is \( 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 49 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 5, 6, 9, 9, 9, 10 \). The sum is \( 5 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 48 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 4, 6, 9, 9, 9, 10 \). The sum is \( 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 47 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 3, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 3 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 45 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 3, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 3 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 44 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 2, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 2 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 43 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 42 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 41 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 40 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 39 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 38 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 8, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 37 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 7, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 6, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 35 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 5, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 34 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 4, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 33 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 3, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 32 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 2, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 2 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 31 \), still too large. 

Let&#39;s try: \( 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30 \), which works. The median is \( \frac{1 + 9}{2} = 5 \), which is not in the list. 

Now, we have the list: \( 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9 \). The sum of the squares is \( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 246 \).
