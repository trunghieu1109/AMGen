        "response": "We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and an even-length list so the median=(two middle terms)/2 is an integer not in the list.  For n=2 no 9\u2019s can appear, so ignore. For n=4 let the sorted list be a1\u2264a2\u2264a3\u2264a4, a total 30, median=(a2+a3)/2\u2261m an integer m\u2209{a1,a2,a3,a4}, and 9 must appear more times than any other entry.  If exactly two 9\u2019s, they cannot occupy both middle positions (or median=9\u2208list), so place them in positions 3&4: a3=a4=9 \u21d2 a1+a2=12.  Then median=(a2+9)/2 integer \u21d2 a2 odd.  Testing a2=7\u21d2a1=5 gives [5,7,9,9], median=(7+9)/2=8 (not in list), 9 appears twice, others once, sum 30.  Sum of squares=5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.  For n=6 or higher the small entries force ties in frequency or non-integer or forbidden medians.  Hence the unique solution is [5,7,9,9] and its sum of squares is 236.\n\nAnswer:236",
