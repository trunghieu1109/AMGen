Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "To determine the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, which means it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b, and 0 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b. The sum of the digits a and c must equal sqrt(n). We will iterate through values of b starting from 2 and count the number of b-beautiful integers for each b until we find the first b that has more than ten such integers. For each b, we will check all possible pairs (a, c) and calculate n, then check if the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n).\n\nAnswer:13",
