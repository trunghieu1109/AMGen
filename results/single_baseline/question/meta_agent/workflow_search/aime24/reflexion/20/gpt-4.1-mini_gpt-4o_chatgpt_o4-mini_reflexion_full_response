Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent LPOH', content="To find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers, we need to count the number of integers n that are b-beautiful for each base b starting from b = 2. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= a, c < b) and a > 0. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the number of such integers n for a given base b. Let's express n in terms of a and c: n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. This gives us the equation ab + c = (a + c)^2. Rearranging, we get ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2. Simplifying, we have ab = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c. We need to count the number of solutions (a, c) for which this equation holds, with 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. We will check for each base b starting from b = 2 and count the number of solutions. We stop when we find a base b with more than 10 solutions. Let's verify the calculations for each base starting from b = 2.\n\nAnswer:6", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

We need to verify the calculations for each base starting from b = 2 to ensure that the count of b-beautiful integers is accurate. The answer provided is 6, but it should be verified by checking each base systematically.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
