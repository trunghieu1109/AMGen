    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent LPOH (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b) and a &gt; 0. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the number of such integers n for a given base b. Let&#39;s express n in terms of a and c: n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. This gives us the equation ab + c = (a + c)^2. Rearranging, we get ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2. Simplifying, we have ab = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c. We need to count the number of solutions (a, c) for which this equation holds, with 1 &lt;= a &lt; b and 0 &lt;= c &lt; b. We will check for each base b starting from b = 2 and count the number of solutions. We stop when we find a base b with more than 10 solutions.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent LPOH (yourself):
6

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent MexS:
The solution approach is correct, but the final answer might be incorrect. We need to verify the calculations for each base starting from b = 2 to ensure that the count of b-beautiful integers is accurate. The answer provided is 6, but it should be verified by checking each base systematically.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
