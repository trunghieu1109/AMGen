Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Rzzp', content='To determine the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, which means it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b, and 0 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b. The sum of the digits a and c must equal sqrt(n). We will iterate through values of b starting from 2 and count the number of b-beautiful integers for each b until we find the first b that has more than ten such integers. For each b, we will check all possible pairs (a, c) and calculate n, then check if the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n).\n\nAnswer:13', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

It is important to show how the number of b-beautiful integers was determined for b = 13 and why it is the least integer with more than ten such integers. Without this, the answer lacks clarity and verification.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.'}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
