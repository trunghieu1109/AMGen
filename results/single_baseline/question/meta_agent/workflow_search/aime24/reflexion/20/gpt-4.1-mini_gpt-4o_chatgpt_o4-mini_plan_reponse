        "response": "To find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers, we need to count the number of integers n that are b-beautiful for each base b starting from b = 2. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= a, c < b) and a > 0. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the number of such integers n for a given base b. Let's express n in terms of a and c: n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. This gives us the equation ab + c = (a + c)^2. Rearranging, we get ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2. Simplifying, we have ab = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c. We need to count the number of solutions (a, c) for which this equation holds, with 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. We will check for each base b starting from b = 2 and count the number of solutions. We stop when we find a base b with more than 10 solutions. Let's verify the calculations for each base starting from b = 2.\n\nAnswer:6",
