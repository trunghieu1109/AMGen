Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We wish to count for each base b≥2 the number of “b-eautiful” integers n having two base-b digits a,c with a+c=√n. Writing n=ab+c and s=a+c gives  s^2 = ab + c = a(b−1)+s ⇒ a(b−1)=s(s−1).  With 1≤a≤b−1, 0≤c≤b−1 and excluding trivial s=1 and s=b, one finds the valid s are exactly those 2≤s≤b−1 with (b−1)∣s(s−1).  Equivalently s mod N where N=b−1 are the roots of s(s−1)≡0 mod N other than s≡1; the total roots mod N is 2^ω(N) where ω(N) is the number of distinct prime factors of N, and removing the s≡1 root gives f(N)=2^ω(N)−1 such two-digit solutions.  We want f(N)>10 ⇒2^ω(N)>11 ⇒ω(N)≥4.  The smallest N with four distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, hence b=N+1=211.
