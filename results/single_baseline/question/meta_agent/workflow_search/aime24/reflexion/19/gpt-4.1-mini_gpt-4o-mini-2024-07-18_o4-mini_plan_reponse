        "response": "To evaluate the product \\( P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\), we can rewrite the expression inside the product. Notice that \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 \\). This can be recognized as a quadratic in terms of \\( \\omega^k \\). We can factor this expression as follows: \\( \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 = 0 \\) has roots given by the quadratic formula. The roots are \\( \\omega^k = 1 \\pm i \\sqrt{1} \\), which simplifies to \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\). We can evaluate the product by substituting these roots and considering the contributions from all 13th roots of unity. The product can be computed as a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity, and we will find the value modulo 1000.\n\nAnswer:512",
