        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \\( P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that \\( \\omega^k \\) are the 13th roots of unity, and they satisfy the equation \\( x^{13} = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( \\omega^{13} = 1 \\) and \\( \\omega^k \\neq 1 \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 12 \\). The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1 \\). We need to evaluate this product modulo 1000. Since the product is symmetric in the roots of unity, we can use properties of roots of unity and symmetry to simplify the expression. The product of all terms \\( (1 - \\omega^k) \\) for \\( k = 1 \\) to 12 is known to be 13, because it is the value of the polynomial \\( x^{13} - 1 \\) at \\( x = 1 \\), divided by \\( x - 1 \\), which is 13. Therefore, the product \\( P \\) simplifies to a power of 13. We need to compute this power modulo 1000. By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the product \\( P \\) is actually \\( 13^6 \\). We compute \\( 13^6 \\mod 1000 \\) using successive squaring: \\( 13^2 = 169 \\), \\( 13^4 = 169^2 = 28561 \\equiv 561 \\mod 1000 \\), and \\( 13^6 = 561 \\times 169 = 94809 \\equiv 809 \\mod 1000 \\). Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 809.\n\nAnswer:809",
