Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: We want P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity. Observe that f(x)=x^2 -2x+2, so P = ∏_{ω^13=1} f(ω). Since x^13 -1 factors as ∏_{ζ^13=1}(x-ζ), the resultant method gives ∏_{ζ^13=1} f(ζ) = Res(x^13 -1, f(x)) = (α^13 -1)(β^13 -1), where α,β are the roots of f(x), i.e. 1±i. 
Compute α^13: α=√2·cis(π/4), so α^13=2^{6.5}·cis(13π/4)=64√2·cis(5π/4)=64√2·(−√2/2 − i√2/2)=−64−64i. Thus α^13−1=−65−64i. Similarly β^13−1=−65+64i. Their product is (−65−64i)(−65+64i)=4225+4096=8321. Hence P=8321, and 8321 mod 1000 = 321.
