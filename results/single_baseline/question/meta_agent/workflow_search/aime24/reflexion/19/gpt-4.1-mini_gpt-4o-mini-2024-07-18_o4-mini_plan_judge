Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \), we can rewrite the expression inside the product. Notice that \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 \). This can be recognized as a quadratic in terms of \( \omega^k \). We can factor this expression as follows: \( \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 = 0 \) has roots given by the quadratic formula. The roots are \( \omega^k = 1 \pm i \sqrt{1} \), which simplifies to \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \). We can evaluate the product by substituting these roots and considering the contributions from all 13th roots of unity. The product can be computed as a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity, and we will find the value modulo 1000.
