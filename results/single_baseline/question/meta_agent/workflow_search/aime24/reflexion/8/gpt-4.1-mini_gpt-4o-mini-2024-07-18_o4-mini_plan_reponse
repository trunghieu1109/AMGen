On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",

        "response": "To find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice. A position is losing for Alice if, after her move, Bob can always win regardless of Alice's choices. We will analyze the game by checking each position from 1 to 2024, determining if it is a winning or losing position based on the possible moves (removing 1 or 4 tokens). We will keep track of the losing positions for Alice, which will correspond to the winning positions for Bob.\n\nAnswer:505",
