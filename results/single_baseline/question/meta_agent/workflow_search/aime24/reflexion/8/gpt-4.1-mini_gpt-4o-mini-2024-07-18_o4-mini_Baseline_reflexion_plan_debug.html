    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PSqT (yourself):
To determine the winning and losing positions for Bob, we need to analyze the game based on the number of tokens left. A position is winning for a player if they can force a win regardless of the opponent&#39;s moves. Conversely, a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. We will identify the losing positions for Alice, which will correspond to winning positions for Bob. The losing positions can be found by checking the outcomes of removing 1 or 4 tokens from the current position. We will iterate through the numbers from 1 to 2024 and classify each position as winning or losing for Alice.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent PSqT (yourself):
505

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent sMVK:
The analysis of winning and losing positions seems to be correct, but the final count of losing positions for Alice (which correspond to winning positions for Bob) needs to be verified. The positions should be checked systematically to ensure that all cases are covered and counted accurately. The number of losing positions for Alice should be recalculated to confirm if it indeed equals 505.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>To find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice. A position is losing for Alice if, after her move, Bob can always win regardless of Alice&#39;s choices. We will analyze the game by checking each position from 1 to 2024, determining if it is a winning or losing position based on the possible moves (removing 1 or 4 tokens). We will keep track of the losing positions for Alice, which will correspond to the winning positions for Bob.
