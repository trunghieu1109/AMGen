Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wk2k', content='To solve this problem, we need to determine the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming optimal play from the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player can force a win. We start by identifying the base cases: 1 token is a winning position for the player whose turn it is, because they can take the last token and win. 2 tokens is a winning position because the player can take 1 token and leave 1 token for the opponent, who will then lose. 3 tokens is a winning position because the player can take 1 token and leave 2 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. 4 tokens is a winning position because the player can take all 4 tokens and win. 5 tokens is a losing position because any move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) leaves a winning position for the opponent. We continue this process to find a pattern. We find that positions that are multiples of 5 are losing positions, because from any multiple of 5, the player can only move to a non-multiple of 5, which is a winning position for the opponent. Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial number of tokens is a multiple of 5. We need to count the multiples of 5 up to 2024.\n\nAnswer:404', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
