Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need P-positions for take-away of 1 or 4 tokens: these satisfy n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Among positive n≤2024, count of n≡0 mod5 is ⌊2024/5⌋=404; count of n≡2 mod5 is ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405. Total=404+405=809.
