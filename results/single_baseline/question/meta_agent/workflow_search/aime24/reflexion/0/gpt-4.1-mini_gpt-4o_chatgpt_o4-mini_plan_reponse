        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

        "response": "First, we need to determine Aya's walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. We know that when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, and when she walks at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert these times into hours: 4 hours is 4 hours, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. The time spent walking is the total time minus the time spent in the coffee shop, t. We have two equations: 9/s + t = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t = 2.4. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solve for s: 9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6s(s+2), which simplifies to 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s. Solving this quadratic equation gives s = 3. Plugging s = 3 into the first equation gives t = 1. Now, if Aya walks at s + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Convert this to minutes and add t: 9/3.5 hours is 2.5714 hours, which is 154.2857 minutes. Adding t = 60 minutes gives a total time of 214.2857 minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.\n\nAnswer:214",
