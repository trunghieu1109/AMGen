Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wamq', content='Let s= walking speed, t= coffee time in minutes. \nAt speed s: walking time = 9/s hours = (9/s)*60 min, so (9/s)*60 + t = 240.  \nAt speed s+2: (9/(s+2))*60 + t = 144.  \nSubtract: 60[9/s – 9/(s+2)] = 96 ⇒ 45[1/s – 1/(s+2)] = 8 ⇒ 90/[s(s+2)] = 8 ⇒ s^2 + 2s – 11.25 = 0 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h.  \nThen t = 240 – (9/2.5)*60 = 240 – 216 = 24 min.  \nAt speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h: walking time = 9/3*60 = 180 min. Total = 180 + 24 = 204 min.\n\nAnswer:204', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
