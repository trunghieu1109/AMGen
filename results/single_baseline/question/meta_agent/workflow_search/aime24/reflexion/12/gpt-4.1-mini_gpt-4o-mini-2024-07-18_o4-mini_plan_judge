Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, we start by letting z = 4e^{iθ} where |z| = 4. Then we can express the given expression in terms of θ. We will separate the real and imaginary parts and maximize the real part with respect to θ. The expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}). We can simplify this and find the real part as a function of θ, then maximize it using calculus or trigonometric identities.

Answer:The maximum real part is 171.
