        "response": "We want to maximize Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] subject to |z|=4. Write z=4e^{i\u03b8}. Then the expression becomes 4(75+117i)e^{i\u03b8} + (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (300+468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8}. Its real part is R(\u03b8)=324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8. This can be written as 540\u00b7cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4) with \u03b4 = arctan2(-432,324). The maximum value of R is 540.\n\nAnswer:540",
