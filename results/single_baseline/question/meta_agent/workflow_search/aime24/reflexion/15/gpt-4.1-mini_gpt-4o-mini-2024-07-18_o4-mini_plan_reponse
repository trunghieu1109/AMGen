In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can denote the number of residents who own all four items as x. We know the total number of residents is 900. We have the counts for those who own each item and the counts for those who own exactly two and exactly three items. We can set up the equation based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion and solve for x. The total number of residents who own at least one item can be expressed as the sum of those who own each item minus the overlaps. We need to account for those who own exactly two and three items to find the correct number of residents who own all four items.\n\nAnswer:The number of residents who own all four items is 0.",
