In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "Let S1\u2013S4 be the four sets (diamond, golf, spade, candy). We know |S1|+|S2|+|S3|+|S4|=195+367+562+900=2024. If nk is # of residents owning exactly k items, then \u2211knk=2024 and \u2211nk=900. Given n2=437, n3=234, and n0=0. So n1+n2+n3+n4=900 \u21d2 n1+n4=900\u2212437\u2212234=229. And n1+2n2+3n3+4n4=2024 \u21d2 n1+4n4=2024\u2212(2\u00b7437+3\u00b7234)=448. Subtracting gives 3n4=219 \u21d2 n4=73.\n\nAnswer:73",
