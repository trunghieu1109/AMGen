Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We are given that there are 900 residents in Aimeville, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. We have the following numbers: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. We also know that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, including the bag of candy hearts.

Let's denote:
- D: residents with a diamond ring
- G: residents with a set of golf clubs
- S: residents with a garden spade
- C: residents with a bag of candy hearts (all 900)

We are looking for the number of residents who own all four items, which is the same as the number who own the three items (D, G, S) since everyone owns C.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

1. Total number of residents = 900
2. Residents owning exactly one of D, G, S = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229
3. Residents owning exactly two of D, G, S = 437
4. Residents owning exactly three of D, G, S = 234

The number of residents owning all three items (D, G, S) is the same as those owning all four items (D, G, S, C), which is 234.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.
