        "correct_answer": "104",
        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "To find the length of CE, we need to analyze the relationships between the rectangles and the collinear points. We know that D, E, C, and F are collinear, and we have the dimensions of rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The dimensions give us the lengths of the sides of the rectangles, which will help us determine the positions of points E and C. Since BC = 16 and AB = 107, we can find the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D. We also know that EFGH has dimensions FG = 17 and EF = 184. By placing the rectangles in a coordinate system and using the collinearity condition, we can calculate the length CE accurately.\n\nAnswer:CE = 184 - 107 = 77",
