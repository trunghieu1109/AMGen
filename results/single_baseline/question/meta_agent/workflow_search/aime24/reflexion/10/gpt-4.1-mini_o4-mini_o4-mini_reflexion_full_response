Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 0oz9', content='Place DCFE on the x–axis with D=(0,0), C=(107,0).  ABCD is then A=(0,16), B=(107,16).  Let E=(x,0), F=(x+184,0) and drop FG downward so G=(x+184,−17), H=(x,−17).  A,D,H,G are concyclic iff x(x+184)=561, giving x=3 or x=−187.  Only x=3 gives E between D and F in the intended configuration, so CE=107−3=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
