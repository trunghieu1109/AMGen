Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH, with D, E, C, F collinear and A, D, H, G concyclic. We need to find CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is part of the line segment DECF. We can use the given lengths of the sides of the rectangles to find CE. Since BC = 16 and FG = 17, and D, E, C, F are collinear, we can find the total length of DECF as BC + FG = 16 + 17 = 33. Since DECF is a straight line, CE is the difference between the total length and the sum of the other segments. Therefore, CE = 33 - (BC + FG) = 33 - 33 = 0. However, this doesn't make sense, so let's reconsider. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and we have the lengths of BC and FG, we can assume that CE is the distance between the endpoints of these segments. Therefore, CE = 16 + 17 = 33.
