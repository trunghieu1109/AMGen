Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Place DCFE on the x–axis with D=(0,0), C=(107,0).  ABCD is then A=(0,16), B=(107,16).  Let E=(x,0), F=(x+184,0) and drop FG downward so G=(x+184,−17), H=(x,−17).  A,D,H,G are concyclic iff x(x+184)=561, giving x=3 or x=−187.  Only x=3 gives E between D and F in the intended configuration, so CE=107−3=104.
