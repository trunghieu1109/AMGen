Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to count all nonempty finite sets B of positive integers such that max(B)∈A.  For a fixed m∈A, the number of B with max(B)=m is 2^(m−1) (each of the other m−1 elements may or may not be included).  Hence ∑_{m∈A}2^{m−1}=2024.  Write 2024 in binary: 2024=1024+512+256+128+64+32+8 =2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3.  Thus m−1∈{10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}.  The sum of these is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.
