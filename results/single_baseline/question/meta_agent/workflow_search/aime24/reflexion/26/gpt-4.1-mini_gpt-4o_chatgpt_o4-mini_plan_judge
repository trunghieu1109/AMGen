Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: Let's analyze the problem step by step. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. We need to find the sum of the elements of A given that Bob's list has 2024 sets.

For each element a in A, the number of nonempty subsets B with maximum element a is 2^(a-1). This is because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to be in B, and then include a as the maximum element.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a-1) for each a in A. We are given that this total is 2024.

Let's express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2:
2024 in binary is 11111100100, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^2.

This corresponds to the set A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 3}, because 2^(a-1) corresponds to a = 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 3 respectively.

Now, we find the sum of the elements of A: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 3 = 48.
