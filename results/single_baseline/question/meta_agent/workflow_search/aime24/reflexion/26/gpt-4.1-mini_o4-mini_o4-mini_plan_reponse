        "response": "We need to count all nonempty finite sets B of positive integers such that max(B)\u2208A.  For a fixed m\u2208A, the number of B with max(B)=m is 2^(m\u22121) (each of the other m\u22121 elements may or may not be included).  Hence \u2211_{m\u2208A}2^{m\u22121}=2024.  Write 2024 in binary: 2024=1024+512+256+128+64+32+8 =2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3.  Thus m\u22121\u2208{10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}.  The sum of these is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.\n\nAnswer:55",
