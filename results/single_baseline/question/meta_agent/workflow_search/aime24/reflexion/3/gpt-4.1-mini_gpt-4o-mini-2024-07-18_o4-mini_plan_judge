Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections of the graphs of the two equations, we need to analyze the functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. First, we will determine the ranges of f and g. The function f(x) has critical points at x = -1/2, 0, and 1/2, leading to the ranges of f being [0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1]. The function g(x) has critical points at x = -1/4, 0, and 1/4, leading to the ranges of g being [0, 1/4] and [1/4, 1/2]. Next, we will analyze the transformations applied to these functions in the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The periodic nature of sine and cosine will affect the number of intersections. We will find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations and count the intersections carefully, considering the periodicity and the ranges of the functions involved.
