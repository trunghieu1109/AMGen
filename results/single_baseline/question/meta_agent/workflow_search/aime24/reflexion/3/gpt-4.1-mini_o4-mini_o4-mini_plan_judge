Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: We seek real (x,y) solving y=A(x)=4·g(f(sin2πx)) and x=B(y)=4·g(f(cos3πy)), with f(t)=||t|−½|, g(u)=||u|−¼|. One checks A,B map [0,1] into [0,1], A is ½‐periodic in x, B is 1⁄3‐periodic in y, so H(x)=B(A(x)) is ½‐periodic. Solutions satisfy x=H(x), y=A(x). Testing endpoints: x=1 gives H(1)=1, so (1,1) is one solution; x=0,0.5 fail. On (0,0.5), numerical sign‐changes of H(x)−x occur twice, yielding two distinct roots, and by ½‐periodicity these repeat on (0.5,1). Hence total roots x∈(0,1] are 2+2+1=5, each giving a unique y. Thus there are 5 intersection points.
