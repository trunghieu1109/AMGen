Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections, we need to analyze the periodicity and behavior of the functions involved. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| has a period of 1, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| also has a period of 1. The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1, as sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is periodic with period 2/3, as cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3. We need to find the number of intersections of these two graphs over their least common period, which is 1. By analyzing the behavior of these functions over one period, we can determine the number of intersections.
