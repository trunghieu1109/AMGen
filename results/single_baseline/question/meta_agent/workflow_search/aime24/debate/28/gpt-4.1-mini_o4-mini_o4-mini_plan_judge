Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We set up the tangency conditions for the torus ((√(x²+y²)−6)²+z²=9) and the sphere (x²+y²+z²=121) and require their normals to be parallel. This yields (r−6)²=(3r/11)², giving r=33/4 and r=33/7. Thus r_i−r_o=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.
