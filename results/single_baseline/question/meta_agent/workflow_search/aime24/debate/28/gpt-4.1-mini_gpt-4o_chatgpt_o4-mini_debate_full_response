Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent TUHs', content='The torus $T$ is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of the circle, giving it a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the internal tangent circle is 6 - 8 = -2, but we take the absolute value, so it is 2. When the torus is externally tangent, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the external tangent circle is 14 - 6 = 8. The difference is 8 - 2 = 6. The problem asks for the difference $r_i - r_o$ in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. Here, $r_i = 8$ and $r_o = 2$, so $r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6$, which can be expressed as $\\frac{6}{1}$. Thus, $m = 6$ and $n = 1$, and $m+n = 7.\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The sphere $S$ has a radius of $11$. When the torus $T$ is externally tangent to the sphere $S$, we consider two cases: one when the torus is inside the sphere and one when it is outside. \n\nFor the inner tangency, the center of the torus is at a distance of $11 - 3 = 8$ from the center of the sphere, since the torus must be inside the sphere and tangent along a circle of radius $r_i$. This gives us the equation: $R - r_i = 8$, so $r_i = R - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1$.\n\nFor the outer tangency, the center of the torus is at a distance of $11 + 3 = 14$ from the center of the sphere, since the torus must be outside the sphere and tangent along a circle of radius $r_o$. This gives us the equation: $R + r_o = 14$, so $r_o = 14 - R = 14 - 9 = 5$.\n\nThe difference $r_i - r_o = 1 - 5 = -4$. However, the problem asks for the absolute difference, so we take the positive value of the difference, which is $4$. The difference can be written as $\\frac{4}{1}$, where $4$ and $1$ are relatively prime. Therefore, $m = 4$ and $n = 1$, so $m+n = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Bps3:\nTo solve the problem, we need to consider two cases: when the torus $T$ is internally tangent to the sphere $S$ and when it is externally tangent to $S$. In both cases, the tangency occurs along a circle. The key is to find the radii of these tangent circles and then compute their difference. The torus $T$ is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of the circle, which gives the torus a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 (since the minor radius of the torus is 3). When the torus is externally tangent, the distance is 11 + 3. For the internal tangent circle, the radius is 6 - (11 - 3) = 6 - 8 = -2, but since radius cannot be negative, we take the absolute value, so it is 2. For the external tangent circle, the radius is (11 + 3) - 6 = 8. The difference is 8 - 2 = 6. However, the problem asks for the difference $r_i - r_o$ in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. Here, $r_i = 8$ and $r_o = 2$, so $r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6$, which can be expressed as $\\frac{6}{1}$. Thus, $m = 6$ and $n = 1$, and $m+n = 7.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zoQk:\n5\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Bps3:\n7\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
