    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent nKNf:
To find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus rests on the sphere, we first need to understand the geometry of the situation. The radius of the sphere S is 11, and the radius of the torus T is 3. The distance from the center of the circle that generates the torus to the axis of rotation is 6. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere when they are tangent is the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the torus, which gives us a total distance of 11 + 3 = 14. The circle of tangency radius r_i corresponds to the scenario when the torus is resting on the sphere, and this radius can be calculated using the formula for the radius of the circle of tangency for an external tangency, which is given by the formula r_i = R - r_t, where R is the radius of the sphere and r_t is the radius of the torus. Thus, r_i = 11 - 3 = 8. For the other case, when the torus is above the sphere, the radius of the circle of tangency r_o can be calculated as r_o = R - r_t + d, where d is the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of rotation, which is 6. Therefore, r_o = 11 - 3 + 6 = 14. Now we compute the difference r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6. However, since we are asked for the absolute difference, we take |r_i - r_o| = 6. The difference can be expressed as 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1. Since 6 and 1 are relatively prime, we can conclude that m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.

### thinking by Debate Agent yZTC:
To find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus rests on the sphere, we first need to understand the geometry of the situation. The radius of the torus is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the radius of the torus. We can calculate the inner and outer tangential radii of the torus to the sphere to find the difference. The inner radius is calculated when the torus is positioned such that its center is closer to the center of the sphere, while the outer radius is when the torus is farther away. After calculating both radii, we will find their difference and express it in the form of a fraction to find m and n.
