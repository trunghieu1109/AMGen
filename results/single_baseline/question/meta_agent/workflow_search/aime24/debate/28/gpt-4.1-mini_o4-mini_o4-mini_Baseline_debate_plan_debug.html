    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent EtNZ:
We place the torus so that its defining equation (after a vertical shift h) is (√(x²+y²)–6)²+(z–h)²=9, and the sphere is x²+y²+z²=121. At a circle of tangency we require both equations and that their normals are parallel. Writing r=√(x²+y²) and using the normal–parallel condition gives h=6z/r. Substituting into the torus and sphere equations yields (r–6)²⋅(1+z²/r²)=9, but 1+z²/r²=(r²+z²)/r²=121/r², so (r–6)²=9r²/121. Hence r–6=±(3r/11), giving r=33/4 or r=33/7. The difference is 33/4–33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.

### thinking by Debate Agent AS18:
We model the torus as the surface ((√(x²+y²)−6)²+z²=9) with axis the z–axis, and the sphere of radius 11 centered at (0,0,−h).  By symmetry the circle of tangency lies in a plane z=const and has radius ρ=√(x²+y²).  Setting up the torus equation (ρ−6)²+z²=9 and the sphere equation ρ²+(z+h)²=121, and imposing that their gradients are parallel (tangency), one finds 

  z = h(ρ−6)/6,
  ρ² = 4356/(36+h²),
  (ρ−6)² = 324/(36+h²).

There are two solutions for d=√(36+h²): d=8 giving ρ=33/4, and d=14 giving ρ=33/7.  The larger ρ=33/4 occurs when the torus sits inside the sphere (inner tangency), and the smaller ρ=33/7 when it sits outside (outer tangency).  Hence r_i−r_o =33/4−33/7 =99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.
