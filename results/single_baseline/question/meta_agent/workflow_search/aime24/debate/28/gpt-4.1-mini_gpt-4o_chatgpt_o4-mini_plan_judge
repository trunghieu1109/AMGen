Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus $T$ is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of the circle, giving it a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the internal tangent circle is 6 - 8 = -2, but we take the absolute value, so it is 2. When the torus is externally tangent, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the external tangent circle is 14 - 6 = 8. The difference is 8 - 2 = 6. The problem asks for the difference $r_i - r_o$ in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. Here, $r_i = 8$ and $r_o = 2$, so $r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6$, which can be expressed as $\frac{6}{1}$. Thus, $m = 6$ and $n = 1$, and $m+n = 7.
