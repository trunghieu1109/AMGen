        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We set up the tangency conditions for the torus ((\u221a(x\u00b2+y\u00b2)\u22126)\u00b2+z\u00b2=9) and the sphere (x\u00b2+y\u00b2+z\u00b2=121) and require their normals to be parallel. This yields (r\u22126)\u00b2=(3r/11)\u00b2, giving r=33/4 and r=33/7. Thus r_i\u2212r_o=33/4\u221233/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127",
