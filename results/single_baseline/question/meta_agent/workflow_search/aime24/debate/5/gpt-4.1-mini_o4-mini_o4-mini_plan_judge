Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We have a disphenoid tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: a=√41, b=√80, c=√89. Each face is a triangle with sides a,b,c, whose area Δ is given by 16Δ²=2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²)−(a⁴+b⁴+c⁴). Substituting a²=41,b²=80,c²=89 gives 16Δ²=12096, so Δ=6√21. Thus total surface area S=4Δ=24√21. The volume V is given by the Cayley–Menger formula for a disphenoid: 288V²=4a²b²c²−a²(b²+c²−a²)²−b²(c²+a²−b²)²−c²(a²+b²−c²)²+(b²+c²−a²)(c²+a²−b²)(a²+b²−c²). Plugging in yields 288V²=409600, so V=80√2/3. The insphere radius is r=3V/S=(3·(80√2/3))/(24√21)=80√2/(24√21)=(10√2)/(3√21)=(10√42)/63. Hence m=10,n=42,p=63 and m+n+p=115.
