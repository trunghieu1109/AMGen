Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 1Zyj', content='To find the distance from point I to the faces of the tetrahedron ABCD, we need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of its faces using the given edge lengths. The distances from point I to each face will be equal, and we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a face in terms of the volume and area of the face. After calculating the areas and volume, we express the distance in the required form. The correct distance is found to be \\frac{8 \\sqrt{5}}{15}, where m=8, n=5, p=15. Thus, m+n+p = 8+5+15 = 28.\n\nAnswer:28', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

First, we need to find the area of each face of the tetrahedron using the given side lengths. The tetrahedron has faces ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD. We will calculate the area of each face using Heron's formula. Then, we will find the volume of the tetrahedron using the formula V = (1/3) * base_area * height, where the height is the distance from point I to the base face. Since the distances from I to all faces are equal, we can set up an equation to find this common distance. After calculating the areas and volume, we can express the distance in the required form and finally find m+n+p.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 3Uuz:\nTo find the distance from point I to the faces of the tetrahedron ABCD, we need to first find the volume of the tetrahedron and the area of its faces.
