Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent hoj5', content='We have a disphenoid tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: a=√41, b=√80, c=√89. Each face is a triangle with sides a,b,c, whose area Δ is given by 16Δ²=2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²)−(a⁴+b⁴+c⁴). Substituting a²=41,b²=80,c²=89 gives 16Δ²=12096, so Δ=6√21. Thus total surface area S=4Δ=24√21. The volume V is given by the Cayley–Menger formula for a disphenoid: 288V²=4a²b²c²−a²(b²+c²−a²)²−b²(c²+a²−b²)²−c²(a²+b²−c²)²+(b²+c²−a²)(c²+a²−b²)(a²+b²−c²). Plugging in yields 288V²=409600, so V=80√2/3. The insphere radius is r=3V/S=(3·(80√2/3))/(24√21)=80√2/(24√21)=(10√2)/(3√21)=(10√42)/63. Hence m=10,n=42,p=63 and m+n+p=115.\n\nAnswer:115', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Such a tetra is isosceles, so its four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41,√80,√89. The insphere radius r satisfies r=3V/S, where V is the volume and S the total surface area.\n\n1. Compute V using the Cayley–Menger‐based formula for isosceles tetrahedra: if opposite edge‐lengths are a,a; b,b; c,c (with a^2=41, b^2=80, c^2=89), one finds\n  288V^2 = 4a^2b^2c^2 − a^2(b^2+c^2−a^2)^2 − b^2(c^2+a^2−b^2)^2 − c^2(a^2+b^2−c^2)^2\n             + (b^2+c^2−a^2)(c^2+a^2−b^2)(a^2+b^2−c^2).\nSubstituting A=41,B=80,C=89 gives 288V^2=409600, so V^2=12800/9 and V=(80√2)/3.\n\n2. Each face is a triangle of sides √41,√80,√89.  By Heron,\n   area^2 =  p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c) = (1/16)[2(ab)^2+2(bc)^2+2(ca)^2−a^4−b^4−c^4]\nwith a^2=41,b^2=80,c^2=89. One finds the common face area=6√21. Thus S=4·6√21=24√21.\n\n3. Therefore the inradius is\n   r=3V/S = 3·(80√2/3)/(24√21) = (80√2)/(24√21) = (10√2)/(3√21) = (10√42)/63.\n\nHence m=10, n=42, p=63, giving m+n+p=10+42+63=115.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent twsf:\nWe recognize the given lengths make a "disphenoid" (isosceles) tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, so all four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41,√80,√89.  \n1.  Compute the face area Δ using Heron’s formula in the form 16Δ²=2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²)−(a⁴+b⁴+c⁴).  Here a²=41,b²=80,c²=89 gives 16Δ²=12096, so Δ=6√21.  Total surface area S=4Δ=24√21.  \n2.  Compute the volume V via the Cayley–Menger determinant.  A direct calculation yields V²=25600/9, so V=160/3.  \n3.  The inradius r satisfies V=(1/3)r·S, so r=3V/S=(3·(160/3))/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=(20√21)/63.  \nThus m=20,n=21,p=63 and m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3bWJ:\n115\n\n### answer by Debate Agent twsf:\n104\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
