There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "To find the distance from point I to the faces of the tetrahedron ABCD, we need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of its faces using the given edge lengths. The distances from point I to each face will be equal, and we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a face in terms of the volume and area of the face. After calculating the areas and volume, we express the distance in the required form. The correct distance is found to be \\frac{8 \\sqrt{5}}{15}, where m=8, n=5, p=15. Thus, m+n+p = 8+5+15 = 28.\n\nAnswer:28",
