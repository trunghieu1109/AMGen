There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "The problem involves finding the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius is given by the formula r = 3V/S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. The volume V can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant, and the surface area S is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. The calculations show that the volume V is 1 and each face has an area of 18, leading to a total surface area S of 72. Thus, the inradius is r = 3*1/72 = 1/24. This can be expressed as 1*sqrt(1)/24, where m = 1, n = 1, p = 24. Therefore, m+n+p = 1+1+24 = 26.\n\nAnswer:26",
