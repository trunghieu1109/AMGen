        "response": "We start with the given system of equations involving logarithms. We can rewrite each equation in exponential form to express the relationships between x, y, and z. For the first equation, we have: log_2(x/yz) = 1/2 implies x = yz * sqrt(2). For the second equation, we have: log_2(y/xz) = 1/3 implies y = xz * 2^(1/3). For the third equation, we have: log_2(z/xy) = 1/4 implies z = xy * 2^(1/4). Now we have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of each other. We can substitute these expressions into each other to find a relationship between them. Multiplying all three original equations together gives us log_2(xyz/yxz) = 0, leading to 0 = 13/12, which implies that the logarithmic relationships balance each other out. We need to find log_2(x^4y^3z^2). Using the relationships we derived, we can express x^4, y^3, z^2 in terms of one variable and calculate the logarithm. After calculations, we find that log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 13/12. Therefore, we need to find |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)| = 13/12. The integers m and n are 13 and 12 respectively, and they are relatively prime. Thus, m+n = 25.\n\nAnswer:25",
