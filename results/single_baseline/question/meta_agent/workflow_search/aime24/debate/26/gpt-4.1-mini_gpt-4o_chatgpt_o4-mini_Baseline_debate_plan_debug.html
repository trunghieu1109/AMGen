    <pre>Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

### thinking by Debate Agent ti31:
To solve the problem, let&#39;s first understand what Bob is doing. For each element a in set A, Bob lists all nonempty subsets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is a. For any positive integer a, the number of such subsets B is 2^(a-1), since we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} and add the element a to it. 

Bob&#39;s total list has 2024 sets, so we have the equation: 

Sum of 2^(a-1) over all a in A = 2024.

Let&#39;s find a set A that satisfies this equation. Notice that 2024 = 2^10 - 8, which suggests that we might be able to express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. 

If A = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, the sum would be 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^9 = 2^10 - 1 = 1023. 

To reach 2024, we need an additional sum of 1001. Observe that 1001 = 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 - 1 = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 - 1.

Therefore, we can add elements 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 to the set A. This gives us:

A = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.

Now, let&#39;s calculate the sum of the elements of A:

Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15 = (15 * 16) / 2 = 120.

### thinking by Debate Agent rmTg:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set A and the sets B that Bob lists. Bob lists all nonempty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. If the maximum element of B is n, then B can be any nonempty subset of {1, 2, ..., n}. The number of nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} is 2^n - 1. Therefore, if A = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_k}, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is (2^{a_1} - 1) + (2^{a_2} - 1) + ... + (2^{a_k} - 1). This sum is given to be 2024. We need to find a set A such that this equation holds true and then find the sum of the elements of A. Let&#39;s start by considering small values of a_i and increasing them until the sum reaches 2024.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the set A such that the sum of 2^(a-1) for each a in A equals 2024. Each element a in A contributes 2^(a-1) sets to Bob&#39;s list. We need to find a combination of such terms that sum to 2024. Notice that 2024 can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2: 2024 = 2^10 - 8 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8. This suggests that A could be {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}. Calculating the sum of these elements: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
