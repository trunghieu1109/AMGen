    <pre>Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

### thinking by Debate Agent vYuB:
We need to find a set A of positive integers such that
  ∑_{a∈A} 2^{a−1} = 2024.
But {2^{a−1}: a∈A} are distinct powers of 2, so A corresponds to the positions of the 1–bits in the binary expansion of 2024.

Compute 2024 in binary:
2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8
      = 2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3.

Hence the exponents k = a−1 are {10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A = {k+1} = {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}.
The sum of elements of A is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4 = 55.

### thinking by Debate Agent EwXX:
Let A be {a1,…,ak}. The number of nonempty B with max=B=a is 2^(a–1). So ∑_{a∈A}2^(a–1)=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024=2^10+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. So A–1={10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, giving A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. The sum is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.

    <pre>Each a in A yields 2^(a−1) nonempty sets whose maximum is a, so ∑_{a∈A}2^(a−1)=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024 = 2^10+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Thus A−1={10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Their sum is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.
