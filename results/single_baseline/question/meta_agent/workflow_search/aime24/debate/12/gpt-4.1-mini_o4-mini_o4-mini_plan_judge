Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4)e^{-iθ} = (300+468i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Its real part is 324 cosθ − 432 sinθ, whose maximum value is √(324² + (−432)²) = √291600 = 540.
