        "response": "Both agents are trying to find the maximum real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4. Agent h2Us simplifies the expression to 324cos\u03b8 and concludes the maximum is 324 when cos\u03b8=1. Agent qRXQ correctly identifies the real part as 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8 and uses the method of expressing it as Rcos(\u03b8-\u03c6) to find the maximum. The magnitude R is calculated as 540, which is the correct maximum value. Agent qRXQ's approach is more thorough and correct.\n\nAnswer:540",
