Then (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4)e^{-iθ} = A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, where A=300+468i, B=24+36i. The real part is Re(Ae^{iθ}+Be^{-iθ}) = (Re A + Re B)cosθ + (Im B - Im A)sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Its maximum is √(324²+(-432)²)=√291600=540.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mjgp:\nWe set z=4e^{iθ}. Let A=75+117i, B=96+144i. The expression is 4A e^{iθ} + (B/4)e^{-iθ}. Write C=4A=300+468i, D=B/4=24+36i. Then its real part f(θ)=Re[C e^{iθ} + D e^{-iθ}]= (300+24)cosθ + (-468+36)sinθ =324 cosθ –432 sinθ. The maximum of M cosθ + N sinθ is √(M^2+N^2)=√(324^2+(-432)^2)=√291600=540.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent RiB1:\n540\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mjgp:\n540\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the 'thinking' field and the final answer in the 'answer' field."}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=-1)]
