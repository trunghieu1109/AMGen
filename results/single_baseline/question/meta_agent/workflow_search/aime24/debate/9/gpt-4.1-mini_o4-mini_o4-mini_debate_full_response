Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent JsPs', content='Total ways to draw 4 from 10 is C(10,4)=210. Jen fixes 4 numbers. Number of outcomes with exactly k matches is C(4,k)·C(6,4−k). For k=2:6·15=90; k=3:4·6=24; k=4:1·1=1. Prize (≥2 matches)=90+24+1=115; grand prize (4 matches)=1. Conditional probability=1/115. So m=1, n=115, m+n=116.\n\nAnswer:116', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Hence m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Q0sR:\n116\n\n### answer by Debate Agent IWia:\n116\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
