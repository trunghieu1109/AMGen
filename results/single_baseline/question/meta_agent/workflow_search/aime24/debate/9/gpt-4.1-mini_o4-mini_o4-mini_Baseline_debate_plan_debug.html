    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent Q0sR:
We need P(grand prize ∣ prize) = P(4 matches)/P(≥2 matches).
Total ways lottery can draw 4 from 10: C(10,4)=210.
Given Jen’s fixed 4 numbers, #ways to get exactly k matches = C(4,k)*C(6,4−k).
Compute:
 k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90
 k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24
 k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1
So #prize (≥2 matches)=90+24+1=115. #grand prize=1.
Hence the conditional probability =1/115, so m+n=1+115=116.

### thinking by Debate Agent IWia:
We need the probability that Jen’s 4 chosen numbers match all 4 of the 4 randomly drawn numbers (grand prize) given that she matched at least 2 numbers (won some prize).

Total possible random draws: C(10,4)=210.
Number of matches k between Jen’s fixed 4 and the draw:
- k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90
- k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24
- k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1

Total prize‐winning draws (k≥2): 90+24+1=115.
Grand‐prize draws (k=4): 1.

Conditional probability = 1/115, in lowest terms. Hence m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.
