    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent oUkV:
To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S and the ways in which she can win both the prize and the grand prize. The set S has 10 elements, and the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S is given by the binomial coefficient C(10, 4). To win a prize, at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers must match 2 of the chosen numbers. To win the grand prize, all 4 of her numbers must match the chosen numbers. We will calculate the number of successful outcomes for both scenarios and then use conditional probability to find the required probability. After calculating, we simplify the fraction to find m and n, and finally compute m+n.

### thinking by Debate Agent uFQW:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize. We start by determining the total ways Jen can pick her numbers and the total ways the lottery can pick numbers. Then we find the number of favorable outcomes for both winning a prize and winning the grand prize. Finally, we apply conditional probability to find the desired fraction and reduce it to its simplest form.

### answer by Debate Agent oUkV:
19

### answer by Debate Agent uFQW:
The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{15}, m+n = 1+15 = 16.

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the &#39;thinking&#39; field and the final answer in the &#39;answer&#39; field.</pre>
