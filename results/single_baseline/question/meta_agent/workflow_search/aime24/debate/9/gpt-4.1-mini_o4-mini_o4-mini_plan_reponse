The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

For k=2:6\u00b715=90; k=3:4\u00b76=24; k=4:1\u00b71=1. Prize (\u22652 matches)=90+24+1=115; grand prize (4 matches)=1. Conditional probability=1/115. So m=1, n=115, m+n=116.\n\nAnswer:116",
