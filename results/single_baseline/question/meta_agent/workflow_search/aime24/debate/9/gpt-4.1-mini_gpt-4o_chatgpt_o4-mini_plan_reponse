The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \\( \\binom{10}{4} = 210 \\). Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We consider two cases: (1) exactly 2 of Jen's numbers are in the chosen 4, and (2) all 4 of Jen's numbers match the chosen 4. For case (1), choose 2 numbers from Jen's 4 numbers and 2 from the remaining 6, \\( \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{2} = 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\). For case (2), choose all 4 numbers correctly, \\( \\binom{4}{4} = 1 \\). Thus, the total number of ways to win a prize is 90 + 1 = 91. The probability of winning a prize is \\( \\frac{91}{210} \\). For the grand prize, all 4 numbers must match, which is 1 way, so the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{210} \\). The conditional probability is \\( \\frac{1/210}{91/210} = \\frac{1}{91} \\). Therefore, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 91 \\), so \\( m+n = 92 \\).\n\nAnswer:92",
