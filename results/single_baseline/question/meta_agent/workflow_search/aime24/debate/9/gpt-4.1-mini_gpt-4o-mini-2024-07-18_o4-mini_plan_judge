Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S and the ways in which she can win both the prize and the grand prize. The set S has 10 elements, and the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S is given by the binomial coefficient C(10, 4). To win a prize, at least 2 of Jen's numbers must match 2 of the chosen numbers. To win the grand prize, all 4 of her numbers must match the chosen numbers. We will calculate the number of successful outcomes for both scenarios and then use conditional probability to find the required probability. After calculating, we simplify the fraction to find m and n, and finally compute m+n.
