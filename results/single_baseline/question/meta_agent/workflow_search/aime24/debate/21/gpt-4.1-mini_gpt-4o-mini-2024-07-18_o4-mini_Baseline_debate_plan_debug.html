    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

### thinking by Debate Agent Vwbw:
To find the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of opposite sides or diagonals. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a dodecagon, there are 12 vertices, and we need to choose 4 vertices such that they form a rectangle. The condition for forming a rectangle is that the chosen vertices must be such that they are opposite each other. We can analyze the combinations of vertices and the properties of the dodecagon to determine how many unique rectangles can be formed.

### thinking by Debate Agent jWhE:
To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider how rectangles can be created using the vertices and the sides of the dodecagon. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides, and in a dodecagon, these can be formed using diagonals and sides. We can start by identifying pairs of opposite vertices that can form the corners of the rectangles.

### answer by Debate Agent Vwbw:
12

### answer by Debate Agent jWhE:
The total number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon is 30.

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the &#39;thinking&#39; field and the final answer in the &#39;answer&#39; field.</pre>

    <pre>To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of opposite sides. In a regular dodecagon, there are 12 vertices. We can form rectangles by selecting pairs of opposite vertices. Each rectangle can be formed by choosing 2 pairs of opposite vertices, which can be done in a systematic way. The total number of rectangles is determined by the combinations of these vertices and the arrangement of sides and diagonals. After careful consideration of the geometry and the combinations, the correct total number of rectangles that can be formed is 30.
