    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent 4bzm:
We want all rectangles whose sides lie on sides or diagonals of a regular 12‐gon.  Equivalently, in the complete graph on 12 vertices in cyclic order, we count all inscribed rectangles formed by intersections of two pairs of parallel chords that are perpendicular.  One shows that every rectangle arises from choosing two parallel lines in one of the six direction‐classes and two parallel lines in the perpendicular class, and that the number of chords in classes m and m+6 are 5 or 6 alternating.  Hence the total is

 sum_{m=0}^5 C(C_m,2)·C(C_{m+6},2)
 =3·(C(5,2))^2+3·(C(6,2))^2
 =3·100+3·225=975.

### thinking by Debate Agent frbz:
We label the 12 vertices 0,…,11 around the circle.  A rectangle must have sides alternating along chords that span k and m=6−k steps (so that the chords are perpendicular: (k+m)·30°=180°).  The unordered pairs {k,m} with 1≤k≤m and k+m=6 are (1,5),(2,4),(3,3), three cases.  In each case a rectangle is determined by choosing a starting vertex a, but a and a+6 give the same set of four vertices, so there are 6 distinct rectangles per case.  Total rectangles = 3·6 = 18.

    <pre>We view all sides and diagonals of the dodecagon as lines.  These 60 distinct lines fall into 12 direction‐classes (orientations spaced 15° apart), with 6 even‐multiple‐of‐15° classes each containing 5 parallel lines and 6 odd‐multiple‐of‐15° classes each containing 6 parallel lines.  A rectangle is determined by choosing two perpendicular directions φ and φ+90° mod 180° and then choosing 2 of the lines in class φ for the opposite sides and 2 of the lines in class φ+90° for the other sides.  There are three perpendicular pairs among the even classes (each contributing C(5,2)^2=100 rectangles) and three among the odd classes (each contributing C(6,2)^2=225 rectangles), for a total of 3·100+3·225=975.
