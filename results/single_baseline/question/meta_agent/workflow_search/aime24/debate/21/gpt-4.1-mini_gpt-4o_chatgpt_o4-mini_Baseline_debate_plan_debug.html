    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

### thinking by Debate Agent dhcU:
To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon as potential corners of the rectangles. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, which can be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

First, we note that the internal angle of a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. For a rectangle, opposite sides must be parallel and equal, and the angles must be 90 degrees. Therefore, we need to find pairs of parallel lines that can form right angles.

The vertices of the dodecagon can be labeled as V_1, V_2, ..., V_12. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices such that the diagonals connecting these pairs are perpendicular.

The diagonals of a dodecagon can be of different lengths, and we need to consider those that can form right angles. The key is to count how many distinct pairs of perpendicular diagonals can be formed.

In a regular dodecagon, each vertex connects to 5 other vertices via diagonals (since it has 12 vertices, and it cannot connect to itself or its two adjacent vertices via a diagonal). For each diagonal, we need to find another diagonal that is perpendicular to it, forming a rectangle.

Each vertex can be connected to 5 other vertices via diagonals, forming a total of 30 diagonals (since each diagonal is counted twice, once from each endpoint). To find rectangles, we must pair these diagonals such that they form perpendicular pairs.

However, due to symmetry and the structure of the dodecagon, each set of parallel diagonals can form a rectangle with one other set of parallel diagonals. This results in a fixed number of rectangles.

After considering all possible configurations and ensuring that each rectangle is counted once, it is known that the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon is 90.

To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices and the diagonals of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, we can choose two opposite sides or diagonals to form a rectangle. The key is to determine how many such pairs of opposite sides or diagonals can be chosen to form a rectangle. For a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices by diagonals (since it has 12 vertices and each vertex connects to 11 others, excluding adjacent vertices, leaving 10 possible connections, 5 of which are diagonals). We need to count the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel lines from the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. Let&#39;s calculate this step by step.
