Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We view all sides and diagonals of the dodecagon as lines.  These 60 distinct lines fall into 12 direction‐classes (orientations spaced 15° apart), with 6 even‐multiple‐of‐15° classes each containing 5 parallel lines and 6 odd‐multiple‐of‐15° classes each containing 6 parallel lines.  A rectangle is determined by choosing two perpendicular directions φ and φ+90° mod 180° and then choosing 2 of the lines in class φ for the opposite sides and 2 of the lines in class φ+90° for the other sides.  There are three perpendicular pairs among the even classes (each contributing C(5,2)^2=100 rectangles) and three among the odd classes (each contributing C(6,2)^2=225 rectangles), for a total of 3·100+3·225=975.
