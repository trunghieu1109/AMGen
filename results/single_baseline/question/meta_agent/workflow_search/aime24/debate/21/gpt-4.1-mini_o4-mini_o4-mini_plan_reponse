        "response": "We view all sides and diagonals of the dodecagon as lines.  These 60 distinct lines fall into 12 direction\u2010classes (orientations spaced 15\u00b0 apart), with 6 even\u2010multiple\u2010of\u201015\u00b0 classes each containing 5 parallel lines and 6 odd\u2010multiple\u2010of\u201015\u00b0 classes each containing 6 parallel lines.  A rectangle is determined by choosing two perpendicular directions \u03c6 and \u03c6+90\u00b0 mod 180\u00b0 and then choosing 2 of the lines in class \u03c6 for the opposite sides and 2 of the lines in class \u03c6+90\u00b0 for the other sides.  There are three perpendicular pairs among the even classes (each contributing C(5,2)^2=100 rectangles) and three among the odd classes (each contributing C(6,2)^2=225 rectangles), for a total of 3\u00b7100+3\u00b7225=975.\n\nAnswer:975",
