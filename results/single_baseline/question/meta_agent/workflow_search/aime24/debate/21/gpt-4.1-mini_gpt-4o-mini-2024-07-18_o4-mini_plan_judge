Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of opposite sides. In a regular dodecagon, there are 12 vertices. We can form rectangles by selecting pairs of opposite vertices. Each rectangle can be formed by choosing 2 pairs of opposite vertices, which can be done in a systematic way. The total number of rectangles is determined by the combinations of these vertices and the arrangement of sides and diagonals. After careful consideration of the geometry and the combinations, the correct total number of rectangles that can be formed is 30.
