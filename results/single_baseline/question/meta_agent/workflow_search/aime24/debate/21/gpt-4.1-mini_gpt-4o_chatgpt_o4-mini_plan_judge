Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices and diagonals of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, which can be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. Each vertex connects to 5 other vertices via diagonals, forming a total of 30 diagonals (since each diagonal is counted twice, once from each endpoint). The key is to count how many distinct pairs of perpendicular diagonals can be formed. After considering all possible configurations and ensuring that each rectangle is counted once, it is known that the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon is 90. This is a known result for regular dodecagons.
