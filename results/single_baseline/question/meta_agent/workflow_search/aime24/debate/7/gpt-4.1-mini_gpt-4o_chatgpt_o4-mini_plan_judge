Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Both agents have correctly solved the problem by setting up the equations from the given logarithmic conditions and solving for x and y. They both found that x = 25 and y = 25^(2/5), leading to xy = 25^(7/5), which simplifies to 25. The calculations and reasoning are consistent and correct, leading to the same final answer.

Answer:25
Extracted answer: 25
