        "response": "Both agents have correctly solved the problem by setting up the equations from the given logarithmic conditions and solving for x and y. They both found that x = 25 and y = 25^(2/5), leading to xy = 25^(7/5), which simplifies to 25. The calculations and reasoning are consistent and correct, leading to the same final answer.\n\nAnswer:25",
