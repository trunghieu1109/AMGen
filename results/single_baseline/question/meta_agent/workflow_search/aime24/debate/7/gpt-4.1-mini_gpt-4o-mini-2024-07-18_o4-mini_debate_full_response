Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 9oxs', content='We start with the equations given in the problem: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\).

We can rewrite these logarithmic equations using the change of base formula and properties of logarithms. Starting with the first equation, we have \\( \\log_x(y^x) = x \\log_x(y) = 10 \\), which implies \\( \\log_x(y) = \\frac{10}{x} \\). For the second equation, \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \\log_y(x) = 10 \\), leading to \\( \\log_y(x) = \\frac{10}{4y} = \\frac{5}{2y} \\). Now we can express \\( \\log_y(x) \\) in terms of \\( \\log_x(y) \\) using the change of base formula: \\( \\log_y(x) = \\frac{1}{\\log_x(y)} \\). Substituting the first equation into this gives us \\( \\log_y(x) = \\frac{x}{10} \\). Setting the two expressions for \\( \\log_y(x) \\) equal to each other, we get \\( \\frac{x}{10} = \\frac{5}{2y} \\). Cross-multiplying yields \\( 2xy = 50 \\), or \\( xy = 25 \\).

Solving this quadratic will give us the values of \\( x \\) and subsequently \\( y \\). Finally, we compute \\( xy \\).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9DCD:\n25\n\n### answer by Debate Agent nqX7:\n100\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
