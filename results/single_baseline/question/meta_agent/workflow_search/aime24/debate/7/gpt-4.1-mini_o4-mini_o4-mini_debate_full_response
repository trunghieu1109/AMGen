So 10/x = 1/(5/(2y)) = 2y/5.\nThus 10/x = 2y/5 ⇒ 10·5 = 2xy ⇒ 50 = 2xy ⇒ xy = 25.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent I621:\nWe have log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ y^x=x^10 ⇒ y=x^(10/x). Also log_y(x^(4y))=10 ⇒ x^(4y)=y^10. Substitute y into this: x^(4·x^(10/x))=[x^(10/x)]^10=x^(100/x). Equate exponents: 4·x^(10/x)=100/x ⇒ x·x^(10/x)=25. But y=x^(10/x), so xy=25.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9vWl:\n25\n\n### answer by Debate Agent I621:\n25\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
