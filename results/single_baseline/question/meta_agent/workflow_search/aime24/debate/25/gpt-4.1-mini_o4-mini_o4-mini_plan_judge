Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We want the side length s of an equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, given that the triangle formed by the lines AB, CD, EF has side‐lengths 200, 240, 300.  A coordinate‐free way is to relate this special triangle back to the one arising from a regular hexagon of side 1 (where that triangle is equilateral of side 3), and observe that in any such hexagon the ratio of a side of the hexagon to a corresponding side of the triangle is 1:3.  Hence under the linear map carrying the regular case (triangle side 3) to the given triangle (one side 240), the hexagon side 1 is carried to 240/3 = 80.  Therefore the hexagon’s side length is 80.

Answer:80
