        "response": "To find the side length of the convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, we need to analyze the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, which has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. The relationship between the triangle's side lengths and the hexagon's side length can be derived from the properties of such hexagons. The side length of the hexagon can be calculated using the formula that relates the triangle's sides to the hexagon's side length. The correct approach is to find the average of the triangle's sides, which gives us the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, we calculate the average: (200 + 240 + 300) / 3 = 240. This indicates that the side length of the hexagon is 240, which is consistent with the properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by its extensions.\n\nAnswer:240",
