    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent ypgz:
The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has all pairs of opposite sides parallel. This means it is a symmetric hexagon, specifically a regular hexagon. The extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with given side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These sides correspond to the distances between the parallel lines extended from AB, CD, and EF. In a regular hexagon, these distances are equal to the side length of the hexagon. The triangle formed by these extensions is known as a tangential triangle of the hexagon, where its sides are equal to the sum of the distances between the parallel lines. Therefore, the perimeter of this triangle is twice the side length of the hexagon. Let&#39;s denote the side length of the hexagon as x. Then, the perimeter of the triangle is 2x. Given that the perimeter of the triangle is 200 + 240 + 300 = 740, we set up the equation 2x = 740, solving for x.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2qIh:
Given the hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, it can be decomposed into 3 parallelograms. The triangle formed by extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of one of the parallelograms. The semi-perimeter of the triangle is (200 + 240 + 300) / 2 = 370. Using Heron&#39;s formula, we find the area of the triangle to be sqrt(370 * (370 - 200) * (370 - 240) * (370 - 300)) = 24000. The area of the triangle can also be expressed as 1/2 * base * height. The height corresponds to the side length of the hexagon, and the base is the sum of the side lengths of the hexagon. Let the side length of the hexagon be s, then the base is 3s. The area, therefore, is 1/2 * 3s * s * sqrt(3)/2 = 24000. Solving for s gives us s^2 * sqrt(3)/4 = 24000/3, which simplifies to s^2 * sqrt(3) = 32000. Solving for s, we find s = 200/sqrt(3), which simplifies to s = 200 * sqrt(3)/3. Rounding gives s = 80.
