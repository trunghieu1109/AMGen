    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent PTKV:
Given that ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, we can deduce that it is a special type of hexagon known as a parallelogram hexagon. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. By the properties of such hexagons, the side lengths of the hexagon can be found using the relationship between the triangle and the hexagon. The side lengths of the hexagon can be obtained by the formula which relates the sides of the triangle to the hexagon&#39;s side length. The side length of the hexagon is given by the formula: side length = (AB + CD + EF) / 3. In this case, we need to find the side length of the hexagon based on the triangle&#39;s side lengths. The side lengths of the triangle can be used to find the corresponding parallel sides of the hexagon. We can set up the equations based on the ratios of the triangle sides and solve for the hexagon&#39;s side length.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9rSH:
In a convex equilateral hexagon where opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of the sides form a triangle. The side lengths of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. To find the side length of the hexagon, we can use the relationship between the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of the hexagon&#39;s sides and the side length of the hexagon itself. The side length of the hexagon can be calculated using the formula that relates the side lengths of the triangle to the side length of the hexagon. The formula is derived from the properties of similar triangles and parallel lines. The side length of the hexagon is the ratio of the triangle&#39;s side lengths to the corresponding segments formed by the hexagon. We can use the sides of the triangle to find the hexagon&#39;s side length by finding the minimum side length from the triangle&#39;s sides divided by 2, which gives us the side length of the hexagon.

    <pre>To find the side length of the convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, we need to analyze the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, which has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. The relationship between the triangle&#39;s side lengths and the hexagon&#39;s side length can be derived from the properties of such hexagons. The side length of the hexagon can be calculated using the formula that relates the triangle&#39;s sides to the hexagon&#39;s side length. The correct approach is to find the average of the triangle&#39;s sides, which gives us the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, we calculate the average: (200 + 240 + 300) / 3 = 240. This indicates that the side length of the hexagon is 240, which is consistent with the properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by its extensions.
