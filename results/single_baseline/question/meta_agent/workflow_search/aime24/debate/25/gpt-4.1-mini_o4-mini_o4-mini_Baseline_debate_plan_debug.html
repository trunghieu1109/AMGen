    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent sDKV:
Let the side vectors of the equilateral hexagon be v1, v2, v3, –v1, –v2, –v3 in order, with |v_i|=s, and directions such that v1→v2→v3 turn around convexly.  One shows that the triangle formed by lines AB (along v1), CD (along v3), EF (along –v2) has side‐lengths L1=L, L2=qL, L3=pL where p=|v3·base1|/|v1·base1|, q=|v2·base1|/|v1·base1| and L=s·[(p(q+1)–q)/(pq)].  Matching {L, qL, pL} to the given {200, 240, 300} up to order gives L=200, qL=300, pL=240 so p=240/200=6/5, q=300/200=3/2.  Then (p(q+1)–q)/(pq)=( (6/5)(5/2)–3/2 )/((6/5)(3/2))=(3–1.5)/(9/5)=(1.5)/(1.8)=5/6, so s=L/(5/6)=200·6/5=240.

### thinking by Debate Agent XGTg:
We recognize that a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel is an affine image of a regular hexagon. In the regular case with side length 1, extending every other side (AB, CD, EF) yields an equilateral triangle of side 3. Under the affine map sending this regular hexagon to the given one, that triangle is carried to the triangle with side lengths 200, 240, 300. Label the equilateral triangle’s edge vectors a₁,a₂,a₃ each of length 3. Under the affine map T, T(aᵢ)=bᵢ where |b₁|=300, |b₂|=240, and |b₃|=200, with b₁+b₂+b₃=0. Choose b₁=(300,0) and b₂ at angle θ so that |b₃|=|−b₁−b₂|=200; the cosine condition is satisfied by the given lengths. The regular hexagon side vector v₁−v₀ equals (1/3)a₂, so under T its image has length |b₂|/3=240/3=80. Hence the hexagon’s side length is 80.

### answer by Debate Agent sDKV:
240

### answer by Debate Agent XGTg:
80

    <pre>We want the side length s of an equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, given that the triangle formed by the lines AB, CD, EF has side‐lengths 200, 240, 300.  A coordinate‐free way is to relate this special triangle back to the one arising from a regular hexagon of side 1 (where that triangle is equilateral of side 3), and observe that in any such hexagon the ratio of a side of the hexagon to a corresponding side of the triangle is 1:3.  Hence under the linear map carrying the regular case (triangle side 3) to the given triangle (one side 240), the hexagon side 1 is carried to 240/3 = 80.  Therefore the hexagon’s side length is 80.
