        "response": "The hexagon ABCDEF is a symmetric equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is known as the tangential triangle of the hexagon, where its sides are equal to the sum of the distances between the parallel lines. The perimeter of this triangle is 200 + 240 + 300 = 740. In a regular hexagon, the distances between the parallel lines are equal to the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is twice the side length of the hexagon. Let the side length of the hexagon be x. Then, the perimeter of the triangle is 2x. Solving 2x = 740 gives x = 370.\n\nAnswer:370",
