    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent NdrS:
We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), and solve for A=(1/3,4√14/3) so that AB=5, AC=10. We find the circumcircle center O on the perpendicular bisectors, get O=(4.5,33/(4√14)), radius R=75/(4√14). The tangents at B and C meet at D=(4.5,−27√14/11). The line AD meets the circle again at P. Parametrizing AD by A+tv with v=D−A, we solve the circle equation and find the nonzero intersection at t_P=2S/A, where S=(O−A)·v and A=|v|^2. Computing yields S=625/11 and |v|=√A=325/22, so AP=t_P|v|=100/13. Thus m=100, n=13 and m+n=113.

### thinking by Debate Agent KwCK:
We wish to find AP where D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle of triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.  A standard approach is to use the fact that the power of D with respect to ω satisfies DB² = DA·DP, and that A,P,D are collinear with P the second intersection of AD with ω beyond A.

1.  Place B=(0,0), C=(9,0).  Solve x²+y²=25 and (x−9)²+y²=100 to get A=(1/3,4√14/3).

2.  Find the circumcenter O of ABC by intersecting perpendicular bisectors of BC (x=4.5) and AB.  One obtains O=(9/2,33√14/56) and R²=5625/224.

3.  The tangent at B to ω has slope m₁=−h/k=−(9/2)/(33√14/56)=−84/(11√14), and at C has slope +84/(11√14).  Solving y=m₁x and y=m₂(x−9) gives D=(9/2,−378/(11√14)).

4.  Compute DB² = (9/2)² + [378/(11√14)]² = (225/22)², so DB=225/22.

5.  Compute DA = distance D to A.  One finds DA =325/22.  By power of a point, DA·DP = DB² ⇒ DP=(DB²)/DA = (225/22)²/(325/22) =2025/286.

6.  Hence AP = DA − DP = (325/22) − (2025/286) =4225/286 −2025/286 =2200/286 =100/13.

Thus m=100, n=13, and m+n=113.
