Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To find the length of segment AP in triangle ABC inscribed in circle Ï‰, we will apply the Power of a Point theorem. The tangents drawn from point D to the circle at points B and C imply that the lengths of these tangents are equal, specifically DB = DC. Since AD intersects the circle again at P, we can use the Power of a Point theorem which states that for point D outside the circle, the power is given by the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection with the circle. We need to calculate the length of AD, which can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle using the formula for the area of triangle ABC and the circumradius R. The sides of the triangle are given as AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We can use Heron's formula to calculate the area of triangle ABC, and then the circumradius R can be calculated using the formula R = (abc)/(4K), where K is the area of the triangle. Finally, we will use the relationship between AD and AP to find AP and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers. After calculating, we find AP = 4/3, giving m = 4 and n = 3. Therefore, m + n = 7.
