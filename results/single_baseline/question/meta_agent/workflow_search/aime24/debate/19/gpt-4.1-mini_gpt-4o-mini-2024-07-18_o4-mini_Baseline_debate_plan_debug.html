    <pre>Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

### thinking by Debate Agent EiAU:
We start with the expression \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \). Notice that \( \omega^k \) are the 13th roots of unity. We can rewrite the term inside the product: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k - 1)^2 \). Thus, we can express the product as \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)^2 = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) \right)^2 \). The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) \) is the polynomial evaluated at 1, where the polynomial is given by \( x^{13} - 1 \). The roots of this polynomial are the 13th roots of unity. Therefore, \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) = (-1)^{13} = -1 \). Hence, \( P = (-1)^2 = 1 \). Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1 is divided by 1000, which is simply 1.

### thinking by Debate Agent eEuH:
To find the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \), we can simplify the expression inside the product. Notice that \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k - 1)^2 \). Thus, we can rewrite the product as \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)^2 = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) \right)^2 \). The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) \) is related to the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity. This polynomial can be expressed as \( x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). We need to evaluate the polynomial at \( x = 1 \), which gives us \( 1^{12} + 1^{11} + \cdots + 1 + 1 = 13 \). Therefore, \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) = (-1)^{13} \cdot 13 = -13 \). Consequently, we have \( P = (-13)^2 = 169 \). Finally, we find the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000, which is simply 169. Hence, the answer is 169.
