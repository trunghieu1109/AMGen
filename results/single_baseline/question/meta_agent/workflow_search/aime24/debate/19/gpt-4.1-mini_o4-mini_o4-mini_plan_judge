Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: We need P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity. Note 2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Thus P = ∏(ω^k - (1+i)) · ∏(ω^k - (1-i)). For any complex a, ∏_{k=0}^{12}(a - ω^k) = a^{13} - 1, so ∏(ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13}(a^{13} - 1) = -(a^{13} - 1). Hence P = [-( (1+i)^{13} - 1 )] · [-( (1-i)^{13} - 1 )] = ( (1+i)^{13} - 1 )·( (1-i)^{13} - 1 ). Compute (1+i)^{13} = (√2 e^{iπ/4})^{13} = 2^{6.5} e^{i13π/4} = 64√2·(-√2/2 - i√2/2) = -64 - 64i. Thus (1+i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, and similarly (1-i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i. Their product is (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Finally, 8321 mod 1000 = 321.
