        "response": "To find the product P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) where \\omega\\neq 1 is a 13th root of unity, we can simplify the expression inside the product. Notice that 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} can be rewritten as (\\omega^k - 1)^2. Thus, we can express the product as P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - 1)^2 = \\left( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - 1) \\right)^2. The product \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - 1) is related to the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, specifically x^{13} - 1. Evaluating this polynomial at x = 1 gives us 1^{12} + 1^{11} + ... + 1 + 1 = 13. Therefore, \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - 1) = (-1)^{13} \\cdot 13 = -13. Consequently, we have P = (-13)^2 = 169. Finally, the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000 is simply 169.\n\nAnswer:169",
