        "problem": "Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",

        "response": "Label the grid entries as a b c in the top row and d e f in the bottom row. Row condition: 100a+10b+c + 100d+10e+f = 999 \u21d2 a+d = b+e = c+f = 9. Column condition: (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 \u21d2 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. Substituting d+e+f = 27 \u2212 (a+b+c) gives 9(a+b+c)=72 \u21d2 a+b+c=8. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3\u22121,2)=C(10,2)=45.\n\nAnswer:45",
