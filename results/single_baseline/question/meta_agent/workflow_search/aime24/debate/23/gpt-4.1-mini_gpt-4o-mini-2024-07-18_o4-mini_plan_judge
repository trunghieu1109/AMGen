Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the conditions given for the grid. The 2x3 grid can be represented as follows: A1 A2 A3 B1 B2 B3. The numbers formed by reading left to right are: First number: A1A2A3 (which is 100*A1 + 10*A2 + A3) and Second number: B1B2B3 (which is 100*B1 + 10*B2 + B3). The first condition states that the sum of these two numbers is 999: 100*A1 + 10*A2 + A3 + 100*B1 + 10*B2 + B3 = 999. The second condition states that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99: A1 + B1, A2 + B2, A3 + B3. Thus, we have: A1 + B1 + A2 + B2 + A3 + B3 = 99. We can express B1, B2, and B3 in terms of A1, A2, and A3 using the first equation. This leads us to set up a system of equations and solve for the valid combinations of digits (0-9) that satisfy both conditions. After analyzing the constraints and performing checks on the possible values for A1, A2, A3, and their corresponding B1, B2, B3, we count the valid combinations that meet the criteria. Through this systematic approach, we can arrive at the total number of valid configurations of the grid that satisfy both conditions.
