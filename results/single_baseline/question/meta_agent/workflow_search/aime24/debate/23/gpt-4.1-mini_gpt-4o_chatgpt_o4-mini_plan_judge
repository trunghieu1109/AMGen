Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We have a 2x3 grid with digits a, b, c in the top row and d, e, f in the bottom row. The conditions are: (1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999, and (2) a + d + b + e + c + f = 99. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 99a + 9b + 99d + 9e = 900, simplifying to 11a + b + 11d + e = 100. We also have c + f = 10(a + d) - 1. We need to find integer solutions for a, b, c, d, e, f where each is a digit (0-9). By testing feasible values for a + d, we find valid configurations for a + d = 9, 10, and 11. After checking all possibilities, there are 6 valid configurations that satisfy all constraints.
