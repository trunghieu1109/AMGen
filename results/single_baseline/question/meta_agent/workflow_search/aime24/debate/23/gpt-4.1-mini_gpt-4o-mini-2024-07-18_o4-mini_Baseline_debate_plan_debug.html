    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent 1tnD:
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the conditions given for the grid. The 2x3 grid can be represented as follows:

```
A1 A2 A3
B1 B2 B3
```

Where A1, A2, A3 are the digits in the first row and B1, B2, B3 are the digits in the second row. The numbers formed by reading left to right are:
- First number: A1A2A3 (which is 100*A1 + 10*A2 + A3)
- Second number: B1B2B3 (which is 100*B1 + 10*B2 + B3)

The first condition states that the sum of these two numbers is 999:

100*A1 + 10*A2 + A3 + 100*B1 + 10*B2 + B3 = 999.

The second condition states that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99:
- First column: A1 + B1
- Second column: A2 + B2
- Third column: A3 + B3

Thus, we have:
A1 + B1 + A2 + B2 + A3 + B3 = 99.

Next, we can express B1, B2, and B3 in terms of A1, A2, and A3 using the first equation. This leads us to set up a system of equations and solve for the valid combinations of digits (0-9) that satisfy both conditions. After analyzing the constraints and performing checks on the possible values for A1, A2, A3, and their corresponding B1, B2, B3, we count the valid combinations that meet the criteria.

Through this systematic approach, we can arrive at the total number of valid configurations of the grid that satisfy both conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8cq3:
We need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by the columns equals 99. The first step is to express the conditions mathematically: let the grid be filled as follows: a, b, c in the first row and d, e, f in the second row. Then the conditions can be expressed as: a*100 + b*10 + c + d*100 + e*10 + f = 999 and a + d, b + e, c + f must add up to 99. We can analyze the possible values for each digit based on the constraints given by the sums.

### answer by Debate Agent 1tnD:
8

### answer by Debate Agent 8cq3:
The total number of valid arrangements that satisfy the conditions is 10.
