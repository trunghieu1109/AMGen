Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent xp9m', content='We use the identity 300(ab+bc+ca)=∑a^2b+∑ab^2+3abc, so S=6·10^6 gives 300σ2−3abc=6·10^6 →100σ2−abc=2·10^6.  Set c=k, let a+b=300−k=x and ab=p.  Then σ2=p+kx, abc=pk, so p(k−100)=100kx−2·10^6.  For k≠100 this yields p=100(200−k), and the quadratic a+b=x, ab=p has discriminant (k−100)^2, giving exactly 2 nonnegative integer (a,b) for each k=0…99 and k=101…200.  That’s 200·2=400 solutions.  For k=100 the equation is identically true and any a+b=200 (201 choices) works.  Total=400+201=601.\n\nAnswer:601', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Using the identity (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)=∑a^2b+∑ab^2+3abc, we get\n300 S2 -3abc=6⋅10^6 ⇒100S2-abc=2⋅10^6.  Equivalently one finds for c≠100 that ab=100(200−c) and a+b=300−c, which yields exactly two ordered solutions for each c=0,…,200 with c≠100, i.e. 200⋅2=400.  For c=100 the equation holds for any a+b=200, giving 201 ordered solutions.  No solutions occur for c>200.  Total ordered triples =400+201=601.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent pHar:\nWe need nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and S=a^2(b+c)+b^2(a+c)+c^2(a+b)=6,000,000. Note S=300(ab+bc+ca)−3abc so the equation is 300σ2−3abc=6·10^6 →100σ2−abc=2·10^6. Testing symmetric cases: \n1) a=b=c=100 gives S=3·100^2·200=6·10^6, one solution.\n2) One variable zero, say c=0, a+b=300: S=300ab; set 300ab=6·10^6 →ab=20000 →a(300−a)=20000 →a^2−300a+20000=0 →a=100 or 200 giving pairs (100,200,0) and (200,100,0). Permuting yields 6 distinct solutions.\nNo other integer roots arise. Total solutions =1+6=7.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pHvq:\n601\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pHar:\n7\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
