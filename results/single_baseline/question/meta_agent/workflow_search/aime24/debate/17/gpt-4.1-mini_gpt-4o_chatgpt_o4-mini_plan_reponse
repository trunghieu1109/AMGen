        "response": "The problem requires finding the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. By analyzing the symmetry and structure of the equations, we consider the case where a = b = c. This leads to a = b = c = 100, which satisfies both equations. Given the symmetry and the specific nature of the cubic terms, it is reasonable to conclude that (100, 100, 100) is the only solution. Therefore, the number of such triples is 1.\n\nAnswer:1",
