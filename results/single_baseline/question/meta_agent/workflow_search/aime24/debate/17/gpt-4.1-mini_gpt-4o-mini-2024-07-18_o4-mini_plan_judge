Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: To find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying the equations a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000, we first note that the first equation constrains the values of a, b, and c. The second equation is a symmetric polynomial that can be rewritten using the first equation. By substituting c = 300 - a - b into the second equation, we can simplify it to find integer solutions for a and b. However, after analyzing the resulting polynomial, it becomes evident that there are no nonnegative integer solutions that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Therefore, the total number of valid triples (a, b, c) is 0.
