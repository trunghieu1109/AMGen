    <pre>Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### thinking by Debate Agent 6vPf:
To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the equation given for the triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c). The first equation is a linear equation representing a plane in three-dimensional space, while the second equation is a quadratic form that represents a surface. We need to find all nonnegative integer solutions to these equations. We can rewrite the quadratic equation in terms of the first equation to simplify the problem, then use combinatorial methods or generating functions to count the valid solutions.

### thinking by Debate Agent zSTx:
To find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) that satisfy both equations, we start with the first equation, which is a linear equation in three variables. The second equation is a symmetric polynomial in a, b, and c. We will manipulate these equations to find integer solutions. First, we note that a + b + c = 300 implies c = 300 - a - b. We can substitute this into the second equation and simplify to get a polynomial in terms of a and b. After simplifying, we can analyze the resulting equation to find integer solutions for a and b, and subsequently for c. Finally, we will count the valid combinations of (a,b,c).

    <pre>To find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying the equations a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000, we first note that the first equation constrains the values of a, b, and c. The second equation is a symmetric polynomial that can be rewritten using the first equation. By substituting c = 300 - a - b into the second equation, we can simplify it to find integer solutions for a and b. However, after analyzing the resulting polynomial, it becomes evident that there are no nonnegative integer solutions that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Therefore, the total number of valid triples (a, b, c) is 0.
