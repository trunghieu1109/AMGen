    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking by Debate Agent KjAs:
In a triangle, if the incenter I and circumcenter O are such that IA is perpendicular to OI, then the triangle is right-angled at A. This implies that angle BAC is 90 degrees. For a right-angled triangle, the circumradius R is half the hypotenuse, and the inradius r can be found using the formula r = (a + b - c)/2, where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse. We know R = 13 and r = 6. Since R = c/2, we have c = 26. The area of the triangle can also be expressed as r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Therefore, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (a + b + 26)/2. The area is also (1/2)ab for the right triangle. Thus, we equate these two expressions for the area: 6 * s = (1/2)ab. Solving these equations will give us ab = AB * AC.

### thinking by Debate Agent pky5:
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the triangle and the given conditions. The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and incircle. This gives us the relation \( R^2 = 2Rr \), where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( r \) is the inradius. Substituting the given values, we have \( 13^2 = 2 \times 13 \times 6 \). Solving this gives \( 169 = 156 \), which is not true, indicating a mistake in the interpretation. However, the correct approach is to use the formula \( R^2 - 2Rr = OI^2 \), which is derived from the condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Substituting the given values, \( 169 - 156 = OI^2 \), giving \( OI^2 = 13 \). Now, using the formula for the power of the point, \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + OI^2 \), where \( c \) is the length of side \( BC \). Since we need \( AB \cdot AC \), we can directly find it using the relation \( AB \cdot AC = 4Rr \cos A \). But since we don&#39;t have \( \cos A \), we use the relation \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + OI^2 \) and \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \), which simplifies to \( AB \cdot AC = 4Rr \) when \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Therefore, substituting the given values, \( AB \cdot AC = 4 \times 13 \times 6 \).

    <pre>The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that the triangle is right-angled at \( A \).
