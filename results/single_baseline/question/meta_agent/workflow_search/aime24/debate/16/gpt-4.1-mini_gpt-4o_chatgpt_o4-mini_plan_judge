Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that the triangle is right-angled at \( A \). For a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse, so \( c = 26 \). The inradius \( r = 6 \) can be used to find the area as \( r \times s \), where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter. The area is also \( \frac{1}{2}ab \) for the right triangle. Equating these gives \( 6 \times s = \frac{1}{2}ab \). Solving these equations will give us \( ab = AB \cdot AC \). The correct relation for \( AB \cdot AC \) when \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) is \( 4Rr \). Substituting the given values, \( AB \cdot AC = 4 \times 13 \times 6 = 312 \).
