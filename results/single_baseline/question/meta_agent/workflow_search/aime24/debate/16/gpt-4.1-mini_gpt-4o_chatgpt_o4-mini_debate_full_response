This implies that angle BAC is 90 degrees. For a right-angled triangle, the circumradius R is half the hypotenuse, and the inradius r can be found using the formula r = (a + b - c)/2, where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse. We know R = 13 and r = 6. Since R = c/2, we have c = 26. The area of the triangle can also be expressed as r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Therefore, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (a + b + 26)/2. The area is also (1/2)ab for the right triangle. Thus, we equate these two expressions for the area: 6 * s = (1/2)ab. Solving these equations will give us ab = AB * AC.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent pky5:\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the triangle and the given conditions. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that \\( A \\) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and incircle. This gives us the relation \\( R^2 = 2Rr \\), where \\( R \\) is the circumradius and \\( r \\) is the inradius. Substituting the given values, we have \\( 13^2 = 2 \\times 13 \\times 6 \\). Solving this gives \\( 169 = 156 \\), which is not true, indicating a mistake in the interpretation. However, the correct approach is to use the formula \\( R^2 - 2Rr = OI^2 \\), which is derived from the condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). Substituting the given values, \\( 169 - 156 = OI^2 \\), giving \\( OI^2 = 13 \\). Now, using the formula for the power of the point, \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + OI^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the length of side \\( BC \\). Since we need \\( AB \\cdot AC \\), we can directly find it using the relation \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4Rr \\cos A \\). But since we don't have \\( \\cos A \\), we use the relation \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + OI^2 \\) and \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\), which simplifies to \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4Rr \\) when \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). Therefore, substituting the given values, \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4 \\times 13 \\times 6 \\).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KjAs:\n360\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pky5:\n312\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
