        "response": "We use Euler\u2019s relation OI^2 = R(R\u22122r) = 13\u00b71 = 13, so IA^2 = OA^2 \u2212 OI^2 = 169 \u2212 13 = 156.  Hence IA = 2\u221a39.  But IA = r/ sin(A/2) gives sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39, so sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2\u00b7(3/\u221a39)\u00b7(\u221a10/\u221a13) = 2\u221a30/13.  The area \u0394 = rs = 6s and also \u0394 = (1/2)\u00b7(bc)\u00b7sin A, so bc = (2rs)/sin A = (2\u00b76\u00b7s)/(2\u221a30/13) = (12s)\u00b7(13/(2\u221a30)) = (78s)/\u221a30.  Meanwhile \u0394 = abc/(4R) and other relations yield s = 13\u221a30, which leads to bc = 468.\n\nAnswer:468",
