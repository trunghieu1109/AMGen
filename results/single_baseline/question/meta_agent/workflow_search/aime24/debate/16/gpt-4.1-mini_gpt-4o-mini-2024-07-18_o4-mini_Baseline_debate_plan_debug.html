    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking by Debate Agent TXmF:
We start with the triangle&#39;s circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. We can use the formula relating the circumradius, inradius, and the sides of the triangle. The area A of triangle ABC can be expressed in two ways: using the circumradius and the sides, and using the inradius and the semi-perimeter. The relationship we will use is: A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter, and A = (abc) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. Additionally, we have the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI, which gives us a special relationship between the sides of the triangle. We can find the value of AB * AC using the properties of the triangle and these relationships.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1IFj:
We are given a triangle with its circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition that the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment from the circumcenter O to the incenter I indicates a specific relationship between the triangle&#39;s sides. We will use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its circumradius and inradius, which is A = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Additionally, we can relate the area to the circumradius using A = (abc)/(4R). We will also use the fact that R = abc/(4A) and r = A/s to find the relationship between the sides of the triangle. We can derive the expression for AB * AC using the known values of R and r. The formula for the product of two sides in terms of the circumradius and inradius can be manipulated to find the desired answer.

The relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the sides of the triangle allows us to find the product AB * AC. After performing the necessary calculations, we find that AB * AC = 156.
