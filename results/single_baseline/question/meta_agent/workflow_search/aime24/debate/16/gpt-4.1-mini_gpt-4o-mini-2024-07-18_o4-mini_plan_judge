Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have a triangle with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The area A can be expressed as A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. We also have A = (abc) / (4R). The condition that IA is perpendicular to OI gives us a special relationship between the sides of the triangle. We can derive the expression for AB * AC using the known values of R and r. The relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the sides of the triangle allows us to find the product AB * AC. After performing the necessary calculations, we find that AB * AC = 156.
