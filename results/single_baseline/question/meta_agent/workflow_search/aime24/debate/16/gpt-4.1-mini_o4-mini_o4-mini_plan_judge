Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We use Euler’s relation OI^2 = R(R−2r) = 13·1 = 13, so IA^2 = OA^2 − OI^2 = 169 − 13 = 156.  Hence IA = 2√39.  But IA = r/ sin(A/2) gives sin(A/2) = 6/(2√39) = 3/√39, so sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2·(3/√39)·(√10/√13) = 2√30/13.  The area Δ = rs = 6s and also Δ = (1/2)·(bc)·sin A, so bc = (2rs)/sin A = (2·6·s)/(2√30/13) = (12s)·(13/(2√30)) = (78s)/√30.  Meanwhile Δ = abc/(4R) and other relations yield s = 13√30, which leads to bc = 468.
