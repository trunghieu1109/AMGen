    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

### thinking by Debate Agent VyeV:
To find the number of paths of length 16 from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we can analyze the movement on the grid. A valid path consists of a sequence of moves right (R) and up (U) that total 8 moves right and 8 moves up, making a total of 16 moves. Changing direction four times implies that there are five segments of movement (since each change creates a new segment). We can represent these segments as alternating sequences of R&#39;s and U&#39;s, where each segment must consist of at least one move. The task is to find the number of ways to arrange these segments while ensuring that the total number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s remains 8 each. We can use the stars and bars combinatorial method to determine the distribution of moves across the segments.

### thinking by Debate Agent RHxb:
To find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid, we need to analyze how the paths can be constructed. Each path consists of a series of right (R) and up (U) moves, totaling 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. Changing direction means switching from R to U or U to R. Since we want exactly four changes in direction, we can think of the path as being divided into five segments (each segment being a sequence of moves in one direction). Each segment must consist of either R&#39;s or U&#39;s, and the segments must alternate starting with either R or U. Each segment will have a certain number of moves, and the total number of moves in all segments must equal 16, with 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. We can express the number of moves in the segments as (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3) where x represents the number of R&#39;s and y the number of U&#39;s in each segment. The total number of paths can be calculated using combinations and multinomial coefficients to account for the different distributions of moves. After calculating, we find the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria.
