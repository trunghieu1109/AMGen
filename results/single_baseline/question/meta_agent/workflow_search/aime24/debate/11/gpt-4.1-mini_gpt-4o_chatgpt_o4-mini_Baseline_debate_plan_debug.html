    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

### thinking by Debate Agent vyrX:
To solve this problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from the lower left to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction exactly four times means there are five segments of consecutive R&#39;s or U&#39;s. 

Let&#39;s denote the segments as follows:
- First segment: R moves
- Second segment: U moves
- Third segment: R moves
- Fourth segment: U moves
- Fifth segment: R moves

Since the total number of R&#39;s is 8 and the total number of U&#39;s is 8, we can assign k1, k2, and k3 to represent the number of R moves in the first, third, and fifth segments, respectively. Similarly, let m1 and m2 represent the number of U moves in the second and fourth segments, respectively.

The constraints are:
k1 + k2 + k3 = 8
m1 + m2 = 8

Additionally, each k and m must be positive integers since the path must change direction exactly four times. Therefore, k1, k2, k3, m1, and m2 must all be at least 1.

We can redefine these variables as:
k1&#39; = k1 - 1, k2&#39; = k2 - 1, k3&#39; = k3 - 1
m1&#39; = m1 - 1, m2&#39; = m2 - 1

Now, the new constraints are:
k1&#39; + k2&#39; + k3&#39; = 5
m1&#39; + m2&#39; = 6

We need to count the number of solutions to these equations in non-negative integers:

1. For k1&#39; + k2&#39; + k3&#39; = 5, the number of solutions is given by the stars and bars method as C(5 + 2, 2) = C(7, 2).
2. For m1&#39; + m2&#39; = 6, the number of solutions is given by C(6 + 1, 1) = C(7, 1).

The total number of paths is the product of these two counts.

### thinking by Debate Agent 4SOg:
To solve this problem, we need to consider paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). We are interested in paths that change direction exactly four times.

A change in direction occurs whenever we switch from R to U or from U to R. To have exactly four changes in direction, we can have sequences like RRR...UUU...RRR...UUU. We can start with either R or U, but we need to ensure we have four segments.

Let&#39;s break down the problem:
1. We can start with R or U, but since we need to end at (8,8), we need to have equal numbers of R and U.
2. Consider the case where we start with R:
   - We can have a sequence like: R^a U^b R^c U^d, where a + c = 8 and b + d = 8.
3. We need to count the number of ways to distribute the 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s such that we have exactly two segments of R and two segments of U.

Let&#39;s calculate the combinations:
- Choose a from {1, 2, ..., 7} (since a must be at least 1 and at most 7).
- Then c = 8 - a.
- For each choice of a, choose b from {1, 2, ..., 7} (since b must be at least 1 and at most 7).
- Then d = 8 - b.

For each combination of (a, b), we have a unique path.

The number of valid (a, b) pairs is 7 * 7 = 49.

We can verify this by considering the reverse path starting with U, which will yield the same count.

Thus, the total number of paths is 49 * 2 = 98.
