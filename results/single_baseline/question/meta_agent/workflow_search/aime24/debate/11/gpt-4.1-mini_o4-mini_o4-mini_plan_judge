Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: A path of 16 moves (8 R, 8 U) has a direction change at each boundary between runs of identical moves. Exactly 4 changes ⇒ exactly 5 runs, alternating between R and U, starting either with R or with U. Case 1 (start R): 3 R‐runs l1+l3+l5=8, positive ⇒ C(7,2)=21; 2 U‐runs l2+l4=8, positive ⇒ C(7,1)=7. Product=147. Case 2 (start U) is symmetric, also 147. Total=147+147=294.
