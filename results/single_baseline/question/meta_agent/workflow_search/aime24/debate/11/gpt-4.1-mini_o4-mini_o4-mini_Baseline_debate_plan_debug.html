    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

### thinking by Debate Agent c4W8:
We need the number of shortest paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 4 direction changes. A direction change occurs between consecutive R and U moves. Such a path of 16 moves (8 R, 8 U) has exactly k runs and yields k–1 changes, so we want k=5 runs. Runs alternate R and U; two cases: starting with R or starting with U. If starting with R, there are 3 R‐runs summing to 8 and 2 U‐runs summing to 8; the number of positive compositions is C(8–1,3–1)=C(7,2)=21 for the R‐runs and C(8–1,2–1)=C(7,1)=7 for the U‐runs, giving 147. Similarly for starting with U, also 147. Total 147+147=294.

### thinking by Debate Agent RzUg:
We need the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 East (E) and 8 North (N) steps, total 16, having exactly 4 changes of direction. A change of direction occurs at each boundary between runs of consecutive identical moves. So exactly 4 changes means exactly 5 runs. The runs alternate between E and N and can start with either. Case 1: start with E. Then runs 1,3,5 are E, runs 2,4 are N. Let the lengths of the E‐runs be l1,l3,l5&gt;0 with l1+l3+l5=8, and N‐runs lengths l2,l4&gt;0 with l2+l4=8. Number of positive solutions for (l1,l3,l5) is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21; for (l2,l4) is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7. Product=147. Case 2: start with N gives the same count 147. Total=147+147=294.

Exactly 4 changes ⇒ exactly 5 runs, alternating between R and U, starting either with R or with U. Case 1 (start R): 3 R‐runs l1+l3+l5=8, positive ⇒ C(7,2)=21; 2 U‐runs l2+l4=8, positive ⇒ C(7,1)=7.
