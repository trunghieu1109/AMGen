Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from the lower left to the upper right corner consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction exactly four times means there are five segments of consecutive R's or U's. We can start with either R or U, but since we need to end at (8,8), we need to have equal numbers of R and U. Consider the case where we start with R: We can have a sequence like: R^a U^b R^c U^d, where a + c = 8 and b + d = 8. We need to count the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's and 8 U's such that we have exactly two segments of R and two segments of U. Choose a from {1, 2, ..., 7} (since a must be at least 1 and at most 7). Then c = 8 - a. For each choice of a, choose b from {1, 2, ..., 7} (since b must be at least 1 and at most 7). Then d = 8 - b. For each combination of (a, b), we have a unique path. The number of valid (a, b) pairs is 7 * 7 = 49. We can verify this by considering the reverse path starting with U, which will yield the same count. Thus, the total number of paths is 49 * 2 = 98.
