        "response": "We seek rhombi with vertices A,B,C,D on the hyperbola x^2/20 \u2212 y^2/24 = 1 whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Such a rhombus is a parallelogram with center at O, so C = \u2212A and D = \u2212B. Equal side lengths force A\u00b7B = 0, i.e. A \u27c2 B. For a given B = (x,y) on the hyperbola, there is an orthogonal A on the hyperbola iff the line through O perpendicular to B meets the hyperbola. That condition becomes 5x^2 < 6y^2. At the boundary 5x^2 = 6y^2 together with x^2/20 \u2212 y^2/24 = 1 gives x^2 = 720/11, y^2 = 600/11, so |B|^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1320/11 = 120. Thus the smallest possible BD^2 = 4|B|^2 approaches 480 from above but is never attained. Hence the greatest real number strictly less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nAnswer:480",
