    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent gUrf:
We have hyperbola H: x^2/20 - y^2/24 =1 centered at O. A parallelogram ABCD with vertices ±A,±B (A,C=−A; B,D=−B) has center at O. In a rhombus the diagonals are perpendicular, so A·B=0. Then BD^2 = |B−(−B)|^2 =4|B|^2 =4(x^2+y^2) with B=(x,y) on H and ∃A≠0 on H orthogonal to B. The line through O orthogonal to B has slope m = −x/y and meets H iff 1/20 − m^2/24&gt;0, i.e. x^2/y^2 &lt;6/5 or 5x^2 &lt;6y^2. To find the greatest lower bound of BD^2 we take the boundary 5x^2 =6y^2, solve with x^2/20 − y^2/24=1. Substituting x^2=(6/5)y^2 gives
(6/5)y^2/20 − y^2/24=1 ⇒ y^2(3/50 −1/24)=1 ⇒ y^2(11/600)=1 ⇒ y^2=600/11, x^2=720/11.
Then |B|^2 =x^2+y^2 =1320/11=120, so infimum of BD^2 is 4·120=480. Since on the boundary A does not exist, BD^2&gt;480 always, so the greatest real &lt;BD^2 ∀rhombi is 480.

### thinking by Debate Agent B0oC:
We have a hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 =1 centered at the origin. A rhombus with vertices A,B,C,D on the hyperbola and diagonals intersecting at the origin must have C=-A and D=-B. Equal side lengths then force A·B=0, so A and B are orthogonal. Parametrize points by (√20 cosh t, √24 sinh t). For B at parameter v, we get BD^2=4|B|^2 =4(20 cosh^2v+24 sinh^2v)=80+176 sinh^2v. Orthogonality with some A at u requires coth u · coth v=6/5, which has a solution u&gt;0 iff coth v ≤6/5, i.e. tanh v ≥5/6, so v ≥ arctanh(5/6). The minimum of BD^2 occurs at tanh v=5/6 giving sinh^2v=25/11 and BD^2=80+176*(25/11)=480. That value is an infimum approached as u→∞ (A escapes to infinity), so for all finite rhombi BD^2&gt;480 and 480 is the greatest real always less than BD^2.

    <pre>We seek rhombi with vertices A,B,C,D on the hyperbola x^2/20 − y^2/24 = 1 whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Such a rhombus is a parallelogram with center at O, so C = −A and D = −B. Equal side lengths force A·B = 0, i.e. A ⟂ B. For a given B = (x,y) on the hyperbola, there is an orthogonal A on the hyperbola iff the line through O perpendicular to B meets the hyperbola. That condition becomes 5x^2 &lt; 6y^2. At the boundary 5x^2 = 6y^2 together with x^2/20 − y^2/24 = 1 gives x^2 = 720/11, y^2 = 600/11, so |B|^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1320/11 = 120. Thus the smallest possible BD^2 = 4|B|^2 approaches 480 from above but is never attained. Hence the greatest real number strictly less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.
