Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than the square of the diagonal BD of a rhombus inscribed in a hyperbola, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. The points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) lie on the hyperbola, satisfying \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The length of the diagonal BD is \(2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\). To maximize \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\), we express \(y_2^2\) in terms of \(x_2^2\) using the hyperbola equation: \( y_2^2 = \frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24 \). Substituting, we get \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 = \frac{11}{5}x_2^2 - 24 \). We maximize this expression subject to the constraint \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). Solving, we find the maximum value of \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\) is slightly above 96, but since we need the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\), we take the floor of the maximum value found, which is 96.
