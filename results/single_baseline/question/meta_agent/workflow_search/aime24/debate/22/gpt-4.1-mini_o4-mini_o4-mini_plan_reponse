        "response": "We need a positive integer list summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and an integer median that is not in the list. For an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle terms. With two 9\u2019s (mode) summing remaining entries to 12, the only choice giving an integer median not in the list is [5,7,9,9], since (7+9)/2=8, and 8 is not in the list. Squaring and summing: 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.\n\nAnswer:236",
