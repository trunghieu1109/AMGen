    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent FJ6w:
We need a list of positive integers that sums to 30, has unique mode 9, and has even length so that the median=(middle two)/2 is an integer not in the list.

Let n be the list length. If n=4, then with two 9’s (mode frequency 2) and two other distinct values summing to 12, the other two must be y and z with y+z=12, y&lt;z&lt;9, and y≠z to keep their frequencies at 1.  Checking possibilities:
– z=7, y=5 gives [5,7,9,9]. Sum=30. Median=(7+9)/2=8, an integer not in the list. Mode=9 is unique.  
– z=8, y=4 gives median=8.5, not integer.
– z=6, y=6 gives duplicate 6’s, tying the mode.
Thus [5,7,9,9] works for n=4.

For n=6 or greater, either the required sum of the non-9’s is too small or you cannot avoid another value tying with 9, or the median condition fails.  So the unique solution is [5,7,9,9].

Sum of squares = 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2 = 25+49+81+81 = 236.

### thinking by Debate Agent KJyD:
We need a positive integer list summing to 30, with unique mode 9, and median an integer not in the list. The median of an even-length list of size n is (a_{n/2}+a_{n/2+1})/2, so n must be even and at least 4. For n=4, let the sorted list be [x,y,9,9] or [x,9,9,y]; mode=9 occurs twice, others ≤1 occurrence. Sum of others is 12. If the list is [5,7,9,9], the median=(7+9)/2=8, which is an integer not in the list. Sum checks: 5+7+9+9=30. No other n=4 combination works. For larger even n, sums and mode constraints fail or median is non-integer. Thus the unique list is [5,7,9,9]. Its squares sum to 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.

    <pre>We need a positive integer list summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and an integer median that is not in the list. For an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle terms. With two 9’s (mode) summing remaining entries to 12, the only choice giving an integer median not in the list is [5,7,9,9], since (7+9)/2=8, and 8 is not in the list. Squaring and summing: 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.
