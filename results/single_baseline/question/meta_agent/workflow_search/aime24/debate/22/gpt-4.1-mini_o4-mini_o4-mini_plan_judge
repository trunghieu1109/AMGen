Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need a positive integer list summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and an integer median that is not in the list. For an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle terms. With two 9â€™s (mode) summing remaining entries to 12, the only choice giving an integer median not in the list is [5,7,9,9], since (7+9)/2=8, and 8 is not in the list. Squaring and summing: 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.
