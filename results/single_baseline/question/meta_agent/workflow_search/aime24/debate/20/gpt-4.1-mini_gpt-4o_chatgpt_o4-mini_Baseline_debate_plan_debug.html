    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent CESO:
To solve this problem, we need to find the least integer base \(b\ge 2\) such that there are more than ten \(b\text{-eautiful}\) integers. A \(b\text{-eautiful}\) integer is a positive integer \(n\) that has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\), and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt{n}\). A two-digit number in base \(b\) can be expressed as \(ab + c\), where \(a\) and \(c\) are the digits, with \(0 \leq a, c &lt; b\) and \(a &gt; 0\). The equation for \(b\text{-eautiful}\) is \(a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}\). For a fixed base \(b\), we need to find all pairs \((a, c)\) such that \(a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}\). Let&#39;s test various bases starting from \(b = 2\) upwards to find the smallest base that gives more than ten such numbers. We compute for each base by iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(c\).

### thinking by Debate Agent DMMS:
To solve the problem, we need to find the least integer b &gt;= 2 such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n is a positive integer that has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be represented as ab, where a is the digit in the &#39;b&#39;s place, and b is the digit in the &#39;1&#39;s place, with 0 &lt;= a &lt; b and 0 &lt;= b &lt; b. The value of this number is a*b + b. We are given that a + b = sqrt(n). So n = (a*b + b)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten integers n that satisfy these conditions. Let&#39;s calculate this step by step for increasing values of b.

    <pre>To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider the definition of a b-beautiful integer. A b-beautiful integer n is one that can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, such that the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form ab + c, where a and c are digits with 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b and a &gt; 0. The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(ab + c). We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten pairs (a, c) satisfying this condition. We test each base starting from b = 2 upwards, calculating the number of valid pairs (a, c) for each base. After testing, we find that for b = 12, there are more than ten such pairs, making it the smallest base satisfying the condition.
