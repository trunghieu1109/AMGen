Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "We seek b \u2265 2 such that there are more than 10 positive integers n = a b + c (with 1 \u2264 a < b, 0 \u2264 c < b) satisfying a + c = \u221an.  Setting s = a + c, we have n = s\u00b2 = a b + c = a(b\u22121) + s, so (b\u22121) divides s(s\u22121).  Counting s in [1, b\u22121] with (b\u22121) | s(s\u22121) yields 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)} solutions (including s=0), of which we need to subtract the trivial s=0 case, giving 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}\u22121 valid s.  Requiring 2^{\u03c9(b\u22121)}\u22121 > 10 implies \u03c9(b\u22121) \u2265 4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 210 = 2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77, so b\u22121=210 \u21d2 b=211.\n\nAnswer:211",
