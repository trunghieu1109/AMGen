Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent D6p4', content='To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider the definition of a b-beautiful integer. A b-beautiful integer n is one that can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, such that the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form ab + c, where a and c are digits with 0 <= a, c < b and a > 0. The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(ab + c). We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten pairs (a, c) satisfying this condition. We test each base starting from b = 2 upwards, calculating the number of valid pairs (a, c) for each base. After testing, we find that for b = 12, there are more than ten such pairs, making it the smallest base satisfying the condition.\n\nAnswer:12', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

A b-beautiful integer n is a positive integer that has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be represented as ab, where a is the digit in the 'b's place, and b is the digit in the '1's place, with 0 <= a < b and 0 <= b < b. The value of this number is a*b + b. We are given that a + b = sqrt(n). So n = (a*b + b)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten integers n that satisfy these conditions. Let's calculate this step by step for increasing values of b.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent CESO:\n12\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DMMS:\n7\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
