Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to consider the definition of a b-beautiful integer. A b-beautiful integer n is one that can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, such that the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form ab + c, where a and c are digits with 0 <= a, c < b and a > 0. The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(ab + c). We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten pairs (a, c) satisfying this condition. We test each base starting from b = 2 upwards, calculating the number of valid pairs (a, c) for each base. After testing, we find that for b = 12, there are more than ten such pairs, making it the smallest base satisfying the condition.\n\nAnswer:12",
