Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek b ≥ 2 such that there are more than 10 positive integers n = a b + c (with 1 ≤ a < b, 0 ≤ c < b) satisfying a + c = √n.  Setting s = a + c, we have n = s² = a b + c = a(b−1) + s, so (b−1) divides s(s−1).  Counting s in [1, b−1] with (b−1) | s(s−1) yields 2^{ω(b−1)} solutions (including s=0), of which we need to subtract the trivial s=0 case, giving 2^{ω(b−1)}−1 valid s.  Requiring 2^{ω(b−1)}−1 > 10 implies ω(b−1) ≥ 4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 210 = 2·3·5·7, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211.
