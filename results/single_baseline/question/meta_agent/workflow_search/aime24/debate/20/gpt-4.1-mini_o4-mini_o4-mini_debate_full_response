Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent We5b', content='We seek b ≥ 2 such that there are more than 10 positive integers n = a b + c (with 1 ≤ a < b, 0 ≤ c < b) satisfying a + c = √n.  Setting s = a + c, we have n = s² = a b + c = a(b−1) + s, so (b−1) divides s(s−1).  Counting s in [1, b−1] with (b−1) | s(s−1) yields 2^{ω(b−1)} solutions (including s=0), of which we need to subtract the trivial s=0 case, giving 2^{ω(b−1)}−1 valid s.  Requiring 2^{ω(b−1)}−1 > 10 implies ω(b−1) ≥ 4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 210 = 2·3·5·7, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211.\n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Set S=sqrt(n), then n=S^2=a b+c and c=S-a ≥0, so S^2 -S = a(b-1). Thus S solves S^2 -S ≡0 mod(b-1), i.e. (2S-1)^2 ≡1 mod4(b-1).  Equivalently the number of solutions equals the number of k≥1 with (b-1)∣k(k+1), k≤b-2 (so a≥1), which by CRT gives exactly 2^{ω(b-1)} roots mod (b-1) in [0,b-2], excluding k≡0 gives 2^{ω(b-1)}−1 valid solutions. We require 2^{ω(b-1)}−1>10 ⇒2^{ω(b-1)}>11 ⇒ω(b-1)≥4. The smallest integer >1 with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, giving b−1=210 ⇒b=211.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent O3t9:\nA two‐digit base‐b number n with digits d,c satisfies d+c=√n.  Write n=db+c so (d+c)^2=s^2=db+c.  Set s=d+c and m=b−1.  One shows that the number of solutions is the number of s in [2,m] with m∣s(s−1), which equals 2^{ω(m)}−1, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.  We need 2^{ω(m)}−1>10 ⇒ ω(m)≥4.  The smallest m with four distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=m+1=211.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent bumh:\n211\n\n### answer by Debate Agent O3t9:\n211\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
