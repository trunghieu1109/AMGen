Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "To find the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we analyze the conditions for a positive integer n to be b-beautiful. A two-digit number in base b can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are the digits (0 <= c < b, 1 <= a < b). The sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). We iterate through values of b starting from 2 and count the number of b-beautiful integers until we find the first b that allows more than ten such integers. After testing various values, we find that for b = 13, there are more than ten valid integers that satisfy the conditions, making it the least integer satisfying the requirement.\n\nAnswer:13",
