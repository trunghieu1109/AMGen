        "response": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be denoted as x, y, and z. The surface area S of the box is given by S = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54, and the volume V is given by V = xyz = 23. We want to find the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain the box, which is given by the formula r = sqrt((x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / 3). To find r^2, we need to compute (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We can use the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) to express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of the surface area and volume. From the surface area equation, we have xy + xz + yz = 27. We can denote p = x + y + z, then p^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2 * 27. We also know that xyz = 23. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or other optimization techniques to find the minimum value of r^2. After some algebra, we find that r^2 = 77/3, which can be expressed as p/q where p = 77 and q = 3. Since 77 and 3 are coprime, we compute p + q = 77 + 3 = 80.\n\nAnswer:80",
