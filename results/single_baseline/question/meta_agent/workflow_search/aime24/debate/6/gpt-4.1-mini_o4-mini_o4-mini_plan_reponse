Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.",

        "response": "We seek the smallest sphere radius r that contains any box with edges a,b,c satisfying ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23. The sphere radius is half the space diagonal, so r^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2)/4. To maximize a^2+b^2+c^2 under the constraints, set two edges equal b=c; then a=23/b^2 and 2ab+b^2=27 gives b=2 or another root. For b=2, a=23/4 and a^2+2b^2=657/16, the maximum. Thus r^2=(1/4)(657/16)=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nAnswer:721",
