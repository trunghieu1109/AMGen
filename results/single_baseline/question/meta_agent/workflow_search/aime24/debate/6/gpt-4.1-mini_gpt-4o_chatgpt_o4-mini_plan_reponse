        "response": "To find the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume, we need to determine the box's space diagonal. Let the box dimensions be x, y, and z. The surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The space diagonal is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we have x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Let s = x + y + z and p = xy + yz + zx. We know 2p = 54, so p = 27. We also have xyz = 23. We need to find s such that s^3 - 27s = 46, which simplifies to s^3 - 27s - 46 = 0. Solving this cubic equation, we find the roots and choose the one that gives the smallest possible diagonal. After solving, we find the minimum value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is 29/2. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is sqrt(29/2)/2, and r^2 = 29/2. Since r^2 is 29/2, we have p = 29 and q = 2, which are coprime. Thus, p + q = 31.\n\nAnswer:31",
