    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent Fbbb:
We need to find the smallest sphere radius that can contain a box with given surface area and volume. Let the box dimensions be x, y, and z. The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is given by xyz = 23. The smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half the diagonal of the box. The diagonal is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We need to express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of xy + yz + zx. From the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we have x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Let s = x + y + z and p = xy + yz + zx. Then, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p. We know 2p = 54, so p = 27. We also have xyz = 23. To minimize the diagonal, we need to minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, which can be done by finding appropriate x, y, z that satisfy the given conditions. We substitute s = x + y + z into the equation for the diagonal: sqrt(s^2 - 54). We need to find s such that s^3 - 27s = 46, which simplifies to s^3 - 27s - 46 = 0. Solving this cubic equation, we find the roots and choose the one that gives the smallest possible diagonal. After solving, we find the minimum value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is 29/2. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is sqrt(29/2)/2, and r^2 = 29/2. Since r^2 is 29/2, we have p = 29 and q = 2, which are coprime. Thus, p + q = 31.

To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. Let&#39;s denote the dimensions of the box as $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have two equations: $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$ for the surface area and $xyz = 23$ for the volume. The smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half the length of the box&#39;s space diagonal, which is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. To find $r^2$, we need to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx$. By the identity $(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)$, we have $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)$. We can solve for $x + y + z$ by using the relations $xy + yz + zx = 27$ and $xyz = 23$. The polynomial with roots $x, y, z$ is $t^3 - (x+y+z)t^2 + (xy+yz+zx)t - xyz = 0$. Substituting $xy + yz + zx = 27$ and $xyz = 23$, we have $t^3 - (x+y+z)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0$. Solving for $t$ gives $x + y + z = 9$. Thus, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9^2 - 2 \times 27 = 81 - 54 = 27$. Therefore, the space diagonal of the box is $\sqrt{27}$, and the radius of the sphere is $\frac{\sqrt{27}}{2}$. Thus, $r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{27}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{4}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{27}{4}$, where $p = 27$ and $q = 4$. Therefore, $p+q = 27 + 4 = 31$.
