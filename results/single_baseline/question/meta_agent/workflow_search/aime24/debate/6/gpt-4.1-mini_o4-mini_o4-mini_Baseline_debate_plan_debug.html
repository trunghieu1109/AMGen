    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6dfo:
We have rectangular boxes with positive edges a,b,c satisfying surface area 2(ab+bc+ca)=54, so ab+bc+ca=27, and volume abc=23. The smallest sphere containing a given box has radius r_box=½√(a^2+b^2+c^2). We require a sphere that contains every such box, so its radius r must be at least the maximum of these half‐diagonals. Thus r^2 = ¼·max(a^2+b^2+c^2) subject to ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23. Use symmetry: at extrema two edges are equal, say b=c=x, a=y. Then constraints give 2yx + x^2 =27 and yx^2=23. From y=23/x^2 substituting yields x^3-27x+46=0 whose positive roots are x=2 or x=-1+2√6≈3.89898. These give two feasible boxes. Compute D^2=a^2+b^2+c^2=y^2+2x^2: for x=2, y=23/4, D^2=(23/4)^2+2·4=657/16≈41.0625; for x≈3.89898, D^2≈32.69. The maximum is 657/16, so r^2=¼·(657/16)=657/64 in lowest terms. Hence p+q=657+64=721.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0Bnz:
We want the maximum box-space diagonal squared given xyz=23 and xy+yz+zx=27. The needed sphere radius is half the space diagonal, so r^2=(1/4)(x^2+y^2+z^2), maximized over the constraints.

Assume two equal edges b and b, and the third a. Then volume gives a b^2=23 ⇒ a=23/b^2, and surface-area condition gives 2ab + b^2=27 ⇒ b^2+46/b=27 ⇒ b^3−27b+46=0. Roots: b=2 or b=−1±2√6 (only b=2 and b=−1+2√6 positive). For b=2, a=23/4; then x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2+2b^2=(529/16)+8=657/16≈41.06. For the other b, x^2+y^2+z^2≈32.7, smaller. Thus max is 657/16, so r^2=(1/4)(657/16)=657/64. Since gcd(657,64)=1, r^2=657/64, sum is 657+64=721.

    <pre>We seek the smallest sphere radius r that contains any box with edges a,b,c satisfying ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23. The sphere radius is half the space diagonal, so r^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2)/4. To maximize a^2+b^2+c^2 under the constraints, set two edges equal b=c; then a=23/b^2 and 2ab+b^2=27 gives b=2 or another root. For b=2, a=23/4 and a^2+2b^2=657/16, the maximum. Thus r^2=(1/4)(657/16)=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.
