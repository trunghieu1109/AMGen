    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent EyTO:
To solve for the number of intersections of the graphs, we need to analyze the functions involved. Let&#39;s start by understanding the functions f and g. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| maps any real number x to a non-negative value, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| similarly maps any real number x to a non-negative value. Both functions have symmetry properties that can be leveraged.

Next, consider the composition f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)). Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively, we only need to consider x in [0,1] and y in [0,2/3].

The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) evaluates to 4g(f(sin(2πx))) over its domain. Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) evaluates to 4g(f(cos(3πy))) over its domain.

To find intersections, we set y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and solve for pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations. This is equivalent to solving 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) for x and y.

Since g(f(x)) has a period of 1/2, we analyze the behavior of these functions over their fundamental periods. The intersections will occur when the outputs of these functions are equal, which happens at regular intervals due to the periodic nature.

By examining these intervals and considering the periodicity, we find that there are 5 intersections within the specified domains.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5RtW:
First, we analyze the functions f(x) and g(x). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a composition of absolute values, which creates a V-shaped graph centered at x = 0.5, with a vertex at f(0) = 0.5. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is another V-shaped function centered at x = 0.25, with a vertex at g(0) = 0.25. Next, we consider the composition of these functions with trigonometric functions: f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)). These will oscillate between certain values due to the periodic nature of sine and cosine. The key is to determine the range of these compositions and then apply g(x) to these results, finally scaling by 4. We focus on the ranges of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)), which will be between 0 and 0.5 due to the absolute value and subtraction. Applying g(x) to these results gives values between 0 and 0.25. Thus, the ranges of 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will be between 0 and 1. We need to find the number of solutions to the system y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both expressions can independently take any value between 0 and 1, any (x, y) pair in this range is a potential intersection. The problem reduces to counting the number of such pairs (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1], which is a continuous range. Therefore, the number of intersections is infinite.
