    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent Wpuo:
We need to count real solutions (x,y) in [0,1]^2 of y=F(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=H(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  Equivalently we seek x∈[0,1] with x=H(F(x)), a continuous piecewise‐linear map G(x)=H(F(x)).  By analyzing F and H one finds F has 16 monotonic linear pieces on [0,1], H has 24 on [0,1], so G=H∘F has 16×24=384 monotonic linear segments.  On each segment G(x) sweeps across [0,1], so G(x)−x has exactly one zero per segment.  Hence there are 384 fixed points, giving 384 intersection points.

### thinking by Debate Agent z2Nu:
We have y=h1(x)=4| | |sin(2πx)|–½ |–¼ | and x=h2(y)=4| | |cos(3πy)|–½ |–¼ |.  Both h1 and h2 map R to [0,1], are piecewise-linear–type waves with 8 oscillations of h1 on x∈[0,1] and 12 oscillations of h2 on y∈[0,1].  The intersections of the two curves y=h1(x) and x=h2(y) in the unit square correspond to fixed points of the composition x→h2(h1(x)), which has one crossing of the diagonal in each monotonic segment.  A detailed count of monotonic segments (8 up and down for h1 and 12 for h2) gives 8·12=96 monotonic branches, hence 96 intersections.

### answer by Debate Agent Wpuo:
384

### answer by Debate Agent z2Nu:

    <pre>We seek the number of solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]^2 to y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  Equivalently fixed points of H(x)=B(A(x)) on [0,1].  A(x) is piecewise‐monotonic with 16 segments in [0,1] (coming from 2 half‐sine bumps and 4 linear pieces of h), and B(y) similarly has 24 monotonic pieces on [0,1].  On each of the at most 16·24=384 small intervals H is monotonic and hence crosses the diagonal x↦H(x) exactly once.  Thus there are 384 intersection points.
