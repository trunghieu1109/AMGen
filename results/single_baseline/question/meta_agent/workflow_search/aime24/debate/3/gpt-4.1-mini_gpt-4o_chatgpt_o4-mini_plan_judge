Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the number of intersections of the graphs, we need to analyze the functions involved. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| maps any real number x to a non-negative value, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| similarly maps any real number x to a non-negative value. Both functions have symmetry properties that can be leveraged. The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) evaluates to 4g(f(sin(2πx))) over its domain. Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) evaluates to 4g(f(cos(3πy))) over its domain. To find intersections, we set y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and solve for pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations. This is equivalent to solving 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) for x and y. Since g(f(x)) has a period of 1/2, we analyze the behavior of these functions over their fundamental periods. The intersections will occur when the outputs of these functions are equal, which happens at regular intervals due to the periodic nature. By examining these intervals and considering the periodicity, we find that there are 5 intersections within the specified domains.
