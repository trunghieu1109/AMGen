Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek the number of solutions (x,y)∈[0,1]^2 to y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  Equivalently fixed points of H(x)=B(A(x)) on [0,1].  A(x) is piecewise‐monotonic with 16 segments in [0,1] (coming from 2 half‐sine bumps and 4 linear pieces of h), and B(y) similarly has 24 monotonic pieces on [0,1].  On each of the at most 16·24=384 small intervals H is monotonic and hence crosses the diagonal x↦H(x) exactly once.  Thus there are 384 intersection points.
