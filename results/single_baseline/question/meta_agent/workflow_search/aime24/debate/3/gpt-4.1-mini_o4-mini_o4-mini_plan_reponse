A(x) is piecewise\u2010monotonic with 16 segments in [0,1] (coming from 2 half\u2010sine bumps and 4 linear pieces of h), and B(y) similarly has 24 monotonic pieces on [0,1].  On each of the at most 16\u00b724=384 small intervals H is monotonic and hence crosses the diagonal x\u21a6H(x) exactly once.  Thus there are 384 intersection points.\n\nAnswer:384",
