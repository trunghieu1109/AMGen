The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the inradius of triangle ABC, we analyze the arrangement of the circles. The eight circles of radius 34 are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle, and the two circles that are tangent to sides AB and BC help us determine the inradius. The inradius can be expressed in terms of the radius of the circles. The relationship between the radius of the larger circles (34) and the smaller circles (1) gives us a proportionality that we can use to derive the inradius. After establishing the necessary relationships and performing the calculations, we find that the inradius can be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime integers. The final result for m+n is calculated based on the derived inradius.\n\nAnswer:67",
