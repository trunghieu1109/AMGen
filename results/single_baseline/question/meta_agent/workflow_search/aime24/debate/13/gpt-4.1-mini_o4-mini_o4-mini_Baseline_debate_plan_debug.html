    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3PFs:
We place eight congruent circles of radius R=34 in a row inside the angle at B, with only the first touching AB and only the last touching BC.  Label the centers C_1,…,C_8, and let θ = ∠ABC.  By reflecting successive circles alternately across AB and BC one sees that the broken‐line from the tangency point on AB to that on BC consists of 2R (up from AB) +7·2R (the 7 gaps between adjacent centers) +2R (down to BC), hence total broken length L = 2R +7·2R +2R = 10R = 340.  On the other hand this broken path can be straightened by reflection into a single segment joining the two sides, making angle θ at the vertex; its straight‐line length is then 340.  For circles of radius 1 the same argument gives a straight‐line length of 2·1 +2023·2·1 +2·1 = 2026.  But both these straight‐segments lie between the same two rays of angle θ, so they must be related by the same angle.  In fact in a wedge of angle θ the distance d between the two bounding rays along any straight‐line makes d proportional to 1 (the “height” of each end) by 1/ sin(θ/2).  Hence

  340 = Δ/ sin(θ/2),     2026 = Δ&#39;/ sin(θ/2)

where Δ = R (the two end‐segments of length R reflect to height R) and Δ&#39; = 1.  Taking the ratio,

  340/(2·34) = 2026/(2·1)
  ⇒ 340/68 = 2026/2
  ⇒ 5 = 1013

which is absurd.  That contradiction shows our reflection count must simply equate the two straight‐line lengths via the same angle θ:

  340 = d/ sin(θ/2),
  2026 = d/ sin(θ/2)

so 340 =2026, also absurd.  The correct reflection argument instead yields the condition

  (8+1)·34 = (2024+1)·1  ⇒ 9·34 =2025,
  ⇒ 306 =2025,

another impossible equality.  We conclude that the only way both chains lie in the same wedge is if θ is such that sin(θ/2) scales exactly by ratio of the total broken lengths 340:2026.  Hence

  sin(θ/2) = 340/2026 = 170/1013.

Now we can find the inradius r_in of ΔABC.  Drop the in‐center I onto AB at distance r_in from AB, and along BC also r_in.  Since I lies on the angle bisector, BI · sin(θ/2) = r_in.  But BI is just the distance from B to the point of tangency of the chain, which is the total broken length minus one radius, i.e. 340–34 =306.  Thus

  r_in = (306)·sin(θ/2) = 306·\frac{170}{1013} = \frac{306·170}{1013} = \frac{52020}{1013}.

This fraction is already in lowest terms (1013 is prime and does not divide 52020).  Therefore m=52020, n=1013, and m+n = 52020+1013 = 53033.

### thinking by Debate Agent sgGC:
We interpret the problem as follows.  In triangle ABC with base AC horizontal, we place a row of n equal circles of radius r along AC, each tangent to AC and to its neighbors in sequence.  The leftmost circle (k=1) is tangent to AB, the rightmost (k=n) to BC.  Their centers lie at x‐coordinates x_k=x_1+2r(k−1), with x_1 determined by the tangency to AB and x_n by that to BC.  One finds
  x_1=r(1+secA)/tanA,
  L−x_n=r(1+secC)/tanC,
where L=AC.  Hence
  L=r[(1+secA)/tanA+2(n−1)+(1+secC)/tanC].
Because the same triangle works for (r,n)=(34,8) and (1,2024), equate L:
  34[U+14]=U+4046,
where U=(1+secA)/tanA+(1+secC)/tanC.  Solve to get
  U=3570/33=1190/11.
But (1+secθ)/tanθ=(1+cosθ)/sinθ=cot(θ/2).  Thus
  cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=1190/11.
On the other hand in any triangle cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=(b)/r, where b=AC and r is the inradius.  Hence
  b/r=1190/11,  so  r=(11/1190)·b.
Finally from the n=2024, r=1 case we get
  b=L=1·[U+2·2023]=(1190/11)+4046=(45696/11).
Thus  r=(11·(45696/11))/1190=45696/1190=192/5,  and m+n=192+5=197.

    <pre>After reviewing both approaches, the second (yielding 197) is based on equating the side lengths for both circle‐chains in the same triangle and applying known half‐angle cotangent formulas. The first leads to contradictions. The standard result for the inradius in lowest terms gives m+n=197.
