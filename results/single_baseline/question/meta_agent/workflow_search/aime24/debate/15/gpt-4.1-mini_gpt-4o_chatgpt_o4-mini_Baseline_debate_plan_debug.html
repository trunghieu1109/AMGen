    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent pb4G:
We are given the total number of residents and the number of residents owning specific items. We want to find the number of residents who own all four items. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. Let&#39;s denote: |A| = 195 (diamond ring), |B| = 367 (golf clubs), |C| = 562 (garden spade), and |D| = 900 (candy hearts, which everyone owns). We know the number of residents owning exactly two of these items is 437, and exactly three is 234. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets (excluding D since everyone owns it) is: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 - x (since these are the ones owning exactly three items). Also, |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 3x (since we add x for those owning all four items, which are counted in each pairwise intersection). Now, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 900 - x since all own candy hearts. Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get: 900 - x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (437 + 3x) + (234 - x). Simplifying gives: 900 - x = 1124 - 437 - 3x + 234 - x. Further simplification: 900 - x = 921 - 4x. Solving for x gives: 4x = 921 - 900, so 4x = 21, thus x = 21.

To find the number of residents who own all four things, we will apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let&#39;s denote: D = residents owning a diamond ring, G = residents owning a set of golf clubs, S = residents owning a garden spade, and C = residents owning a bag of candy hearts. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts). |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 (those who own exactly three of the first three items). |(D ∩ G) ∪ (G ∩ S) ∪ (S ∩ D)| = 437 (those who own exactly two of the first three items). We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, which is the number of residents owning all four items. Using inclusion-exclusion, we have: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| - |S ∩ D| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 (since everyone has a bag of candy hearts). We can rearrange the equation to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|: 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + 234 - |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Solving for |D ∩ G ∩ S| gives us the number of residents who own all four items.

    <pre>To find the number of residents who own all four items, we need to apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let&#39;s denote: |A| = 195 (diamond ring), |B| = 367 (golf clubs), |C| = 562 (garden spade), and |D| = 900 (candy hearts, which everyone owns). We know the number of residents owning exactly two of these items is 437, and exactly three is 234. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets (excluding D since everyone owns it) is: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 - x (since these are the ones owning exactly three items). Also, |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 3x (since we add x for those owning all four items, which are counted in each pairwise intersection). Now, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 900 - x since all own candy hearts. Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get: 900 - x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (437 + 3x) + (234 - x). Simplifying gives: 900 - x = 1124 - 437 - 3x + 234 - x. Further simplification: 900 - x = 921 - 4x. Solving for x gives: 4x = 921 - 900, so 4x = 21, thus x = 7. However, this seems incorrect as the previous calculation was 21. Re-evaluating the simplification: 900 - x = 1124 - 437 - 3x + 234 - x simplifies to 900 - x = 921 - 4x, which gives 3x = 21, so x = 7. The correct simplification should be 4x = 21, so x = 21. Therefore, the correct answer is 21.
