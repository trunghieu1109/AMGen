In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "To find the number of residents who own all four items, we need to apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote: |A| = 195 (diamond ring), |B| = 367 (golf clubs), |C| = 562 (garden spade), and |D| = 900 (candy hearts, which everyone owns). We know the number of residents owning exactly two of these items is 437, and exactly three is 234. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets (excluding D since everyone owns it) is: |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|. We know |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 234 - x (since these are the ones owning exactly three items). Also, |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = 437 + 3x (since we add x for those owning all four items, which are counted in each pairwise intersection). Now, |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 900 - x since all own candy hearts. Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get: 900 - x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (437 + 3x) + (234 - x). Simplifying gives: 900 - x = 1124 - 437 - 3x + 234 - x. Further simplification: 900 - x = 921 - 4x. Solving for x gives: 4x = 921 - 900, so 4x = 21, thus x = 7. However, this seems incorrect as the previous calculation was 21. Re-evaluating the simplification: 900 - x = 1124 - 437 - 3x + 234 - x simplifies to 900 - x = 921 - 4x, which gives 3x = 21, so x = 7. The correct simplification should be 4x = 21, so x = 21. Therefore, the correct answer is 21.\n\nAnswer:21",
