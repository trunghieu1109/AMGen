    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent w8L8:
Let D, G, S, C be the sets of owners. C has size 900 (everyone).  
Total memberships = |D|+|G|+|S|+|C| = 195+367+562+900 = 2024.  
Let N_k = number of residents owning exactly k of the four items.  
Given N_2 = 437, N_3 = 234, N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 = 900 ⇒ N_1 + N_4 = 900−(437+234) = 229.  
Also sum of memberships = 1·N_1 +2·437 +3·234 +4·N_4 = N_1 +874 +702 +4N_4 = N_1 +1576 +4N_4 =2024.  
Substitute N_1 = 229−N_4:  (229−N_4)+1576+4N_4 =2024 ⇒1805+3N_4=2024 ⇒3N_4=219 ⇒N_4=73.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9otq:
Let D,G,S,C be the sets of residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. We have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900 (since every resident owns candy hearts). Also exactly two owners N2=437, exactly three owners N3=234, exactly four owners N4=x. Let N1 be those owning exactly one. Total residents: N1+N2+N3+N4=900 so N1=900−437−234−x=229−x. The total count of item‐ownerships is ∑|sets|=195+367+562+900=2024 and also equals 1·N1+2·N2+3·N3+4·N4 = (229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x = 229−x+874+702+4x = 1805+3x. Equate: 1805+3x=2024 ⇒3x=219 ⇒x=73.

    <pre>Let D, G, S, C be the sets of owners of diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts respectively. We have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900. Let N_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of these items. Given N₂=437, N₃=234, N₁+N₂+N₃+N₄=900 ⇒ N₁=229−N₄. The total count of ownerships is |D|+|G|+|S|+|C|=2024, which also equals N₁+2·N₂+3·N₃+4·N₄ = (229−N₄)+874+702+4N₄ = 1805+3N₄.  Setting 1805+3N₄=2024 gives 3N₄=219, so N₄=73.
