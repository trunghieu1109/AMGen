    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent pueL:
We have the total number of residents (900) and the number of residents who own each item. We also know how many own exactly two items and exactly three items. Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to set up the equations based on the given data. The total number of ownerships must equal the number of residents owning at least one item, which is 900. We can express the ownership counts in terms of x and solve for x.

### thinking by Debate Agent cQ0y:
To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know the total number of residents (900), the number of residents who own each item, the number who own exactly two items, and the number who own all three items. We can denote the number of residents who own all four items as x. The equation can be set up as follows: Total residents = (number who own at least one item) + (number who own exactly two items) + (number who own exactly three items) + (number who own all four items). Since we know that the total number of residents is 900, we can rearrange the equation to solve for x. We can find that the number of residents who own at least one of the first three items is 195 + 367 + 562 - (number who own exactly two items) - 2*(number who own all three items) + x = 900. After calculating the values, we can determine the value of x.
