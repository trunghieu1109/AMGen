In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know the total number of residents (900), the number of residents who own each item (195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades), the number who own exactly two items (437), and the number who own exactly three items (234). Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. The equation can be set up as follows: Total residents = (number who own at least one item) + (number who own exactly two items) + (number who own exactly three items) + (number who own all four items). Since we know that the total number of residents is 900, we can rearrange the equation to solve for x. After calculating the values, we find that the number of residents who own all four items is 0.\n\nAnswer:0",
