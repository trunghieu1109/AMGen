In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "Let D, G, S, C be the sets of owners of diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts respectively. We have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900. Let N_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of these items. Given N\u2082=437, N\u2083=234, N\u2081+N\u2082+N\u2083+N\u2084=900 \u21d2 N\u2081=229\u2212N\u2084. The total count of ownerships is |D|+|G|+|S|+|C|=2024, which also equals N\u2081+2\u00b7N\u2082+3\u00b7N\u2083+4\u00b7N\u2084 = (229\u2212N\u2084)+874+702+4N\u2084 = 1805+3N\u2084.  Setting 1805+3N\u2084=2024 gives 3N\u2084=219, so N\u2084=73.\n\nAnswer:73",
