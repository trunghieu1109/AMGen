Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent bUU3', content='We need the largest 4-digit N such that changing any one digit to 1 makes the resulting number divisible by 7. Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d. For each position i, replacing that digit by 1 changes N by Δi≡7-coeff×(digit−1) mod7. Reducing 1000≡6,100≡2,10≡3 mod7, we require 6(1−a)≡2(1−b)≡3(1−c)≡(1−d) mod7. From these congruences one finds a≡5, b≡6, d≡4, and c≡2a−1≡9 mod7 so c=2 or 9. To maximize N choose c=9, giving N=5694. Dividing by 1000 yields Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Write congruences mod\u20097 for each replacement: 6+2b+3c+d≡0; 6a+2+3c+d≡0; 6a+2b+3+d≡0; 6a+2b+3c+1≡0. Rewriting 6≡-1 gives: 2b+3c+d≡1; -a+3c+d≡5; -a+2b+d≡4; -a+2b+3c≡6. From these we derive d≡3c−2 mod7, b≡5c−4 mod7, and then 2c−3≡1→c≡2 mod7→c=2 or 9. Both give b≡6,d≡4,a≡5. Thus N=5600+10c+4, maximal when c=9→N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5,R=694 so Q+R=699.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent psIW:\nWe seek the largest 4-digit N = abcd such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d. For each position i, replacing digit i by 1 gives Ni ≡0 mod7, so N + Δi ≡0 mod7, where Δi is the change. This forces Δ1≡Δ2≡Δ3≡Δ4 (mod7) and additionally N ≡−Δi (mod7). Writing Δ1=1000(1−a), Δ2=100(1−b), Δ3=10(1−c), Δ4=(1−d) and reducing mod7 (1000≡6,100≡2,10≡3) gives 6(1−a)≡2(1−b)≡3(1−c)≡(1−d) mod7. From these we find b≡3a−2, c≡2a−1, d≡6a−5 (mod7). The extra condition N≡−(1−d) mod7 leads to 6a+2b+3c≡6 mod7, which simplifies to 4a≡6 mod7, so a≡5 mod7. The only valid thousands digit 1≤a≤9 is a=5. Then b=6, d=4, and c≡2a−1≡9 mod7, giving candidates c=2 or 9. To maximize N choose c=9. So N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5, R=694 and Q+R=699.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Oczd:\n699\n\n### answer by Debate Agent psIW:\n699\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
