    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking by Debate Agent EwEt:
To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to consider each digit position. A four-digit number can be represented as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. If changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7, then the numbers 1000(1) + 100b + 10c + d, 1000a + 100(1) + 10c + d, 1000a + 100b + 10(1) + d, and 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must all be divisible by 7. Starting with the largest four-digit number, 9999, we check if changing each digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. If not, we decrement and check again. The goal is to find the largest such number N. Through trial and error, we find that N = 8991 satisfies the condition. When N = 8991, changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then divide N by 1000 to find Q and R. Q is the integer part of the division, and R is the remainder. Finally, we calculate Q + R.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZLXL:
To solve for the greatest four-digit integer N with the property that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start by defining N as a four-digit number, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, and d are digits. The conditions imply:
1. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 is divisible by 7.
2. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d is divisible by 7.
3. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d is divisible by 7.
4. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d is divisible by 7.

Since we want the greatest N, we start with a = 9, the largest possible value for a. Then, check if the conditions can be satisfied.

We need to check which values of b, c, and d satisfy all four divisibility conditions when a = 9. Begin with b = 9 and test downwards, similarly for c and d.

Calculate for each digit change and check divisibility by 7. Adjust values if necessary until all conditions are met.

Ultimately, the goal is to find the largest number N that satisfies all conditions and compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000, then find Q + R.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. The conditions are: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1, 1000a + 100b + 10 + d, 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, and 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must all be divisible by 7.

When N = 8991, changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then divide N by 1000 to find Q and R. Q is the integer part of the division, and R is the remainder. Finally, we calculate Q + R. N = 8991, Q = 8, R = 991, so Q + R = 8 + 991 = 999.
