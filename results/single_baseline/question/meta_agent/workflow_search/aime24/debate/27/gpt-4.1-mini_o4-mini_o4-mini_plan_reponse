        "response": "We need the largest 4-digit N such that changing any one digit to 1 makes the resulting number divisible by 7. Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d. For each position i, replacing that digit by 1 changes N by \u0394i\u22617-coeff\u00d7(digit\u22121) mod7. Reducing 1000\u22616,100\u22612,10\u22613 mod7, we require 6(1\u2212a)\u22612(1\u2212b)\u22613(1\u2212c)\u2261(1\u2212d) mod7. From these congruences one finds a\u22615, b\u22616, d\u22614, and c\u22612a\u22121\u22619 mod7 so c=2 or 9. To maximize N choose c=9, giving N=5694. Dividing by 1000 yields Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699",
