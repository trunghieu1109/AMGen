        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. The conditions are: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1, 1000a + 100b + 10 + d, 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, and 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must all be divisible by 7. We start with the largest possible value for a, which is 9, and check if the conditions can be satisfied. Through trial and error, we find that N = 8991 satisfies the condition. When N = 8991, changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then divide N by 1000 to find Q and R. Q is the integer part of the division, and R is the remainder. Finally, we calculate Q + R. N = 8991, Q = 8, R = 991, so Q + R = 8 + 991 = 999.\n\nAnswer:999",
