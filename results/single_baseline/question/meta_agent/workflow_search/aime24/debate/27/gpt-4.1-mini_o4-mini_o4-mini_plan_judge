Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We need the largest 4-digit N such that changing any one digit to 1 makes the resulting number divisible by 7. Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d. For each position i, replacing that digit by 1 changes N by Δi≡7-coeff×(digit−1) mod7. Reducing 1000≡6,100≡2,10≡3 mod7, we require 6(1−a)≡2(1−b)≡3(1−c)≡(1−d) mod7. From these congruences one finds a≡5, b≡6, d≡4, and c≡2a−1≡9 mod7 so c=2 or 9. To maximize N choose c=9, giving N=5694. Dividing by 1000 yields Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.
