Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need maximal placements where each occupied row/column is a single color and you can’t add another chip. If all chips are white or all are black, that gives 2 configurations. For mixed colors, choose a nonempty subset of rows to be white (and the rest black) in 2^5−2=30 ways, and similarly 30 ways for columns. Chips go in cells where row and column colors match, giving 30×30=900. Total = 900+2 = 902.
