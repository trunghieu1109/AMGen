    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZDuK:
We need maximal placements so that each row and column has uniform color and no more chips can be added. A maximal configuration arises by choosing for each row and each column a color (white/black) such that every row and column has at least one chip. A chip is placed exactly at each cell where the row color equals the column color. To avoid empty rows/columns, the set of colors used for rows must equal that for columns and be nonempty. If only one color is used (white or black), there are 2 choices (all white or all black) giving 1 configuration each. If both colors are used, the row color vector is any of the 2^5–2=30 sequences using both colors, similarly for columns, for 30×30=900 configurations. Total = 900+1+1 = 902.

### thinking by Debate Agent KMLS:
We need maximal placements of chips so that each row and column with any chips is monochromatic, and no further chip can be added without violating this.  By careful case analysis one finds exactly two monochromatic full‐grid placements (all white or all black) plus configurations where both colors appear.  In the mixed‐color case one must partition the 5 rows into two nonempty sets for white and black (2^5−2=30 choices) and likewise the 5 columns (30 choices), giving 30×30=900.  Total = 900+2 = 902.

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the &#39;thinking&#39; field and the final answer in the &#39;answer&#39; field.</pre>

    <pre>We need maximal placements where each occupied row/column is a single color and you can’t add another chip. If all chips are white or all are black, that gives 2 configurations. For mixed colors, choose a nonempty subset of rows to be white (and the rest black) in 2^5−2=30 ways, and similarly 30 ways for columns. Chips go in cells where row and column colors match, giving 30×30=900. Total = 900+2 = 902.
