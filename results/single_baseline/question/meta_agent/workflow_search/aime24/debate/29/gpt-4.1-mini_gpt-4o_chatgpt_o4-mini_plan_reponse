        "response": "The problem requires placing chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is filled with chips of only one color, and no additional chip can be placed without violating this condition. The key is to ensure that the number of rows filled with white chips equals the number of columns filled with white chips, and similarly for black chips. This means we can choose k rows to be white and k columns to be white, where k ranges from 0 to 5. For each k, the number of ways to choose k rows from 5 is C(5, k), and the same for columns. Thus, the number of configurations for each k is C(5, k)^2. Summing over all k from 0 to 5 gives the total number of configurations: C(5, 0)^2 + C(5, 1)^2 + C(5, 2)^2 + C(5, 3)^2 + C(5, 4)^2 + C(5, 5)^2 = 1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252.\n\nAnswer:252",
