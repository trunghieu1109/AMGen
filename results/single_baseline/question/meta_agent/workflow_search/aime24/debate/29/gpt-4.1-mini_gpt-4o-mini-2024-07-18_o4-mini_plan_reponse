        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the constraints imposed by the grid and the chips. Each row and each column can have chips of only one color, which means that if we place a chip in a row, all chips in that row must be of the same color. The same applies to the columns. Therefore, each row can either be completely filled with white chips, completely filled with black chips, or left empty. The same logic applies to the columns. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we must ensure that we do not exceed the limit of 25 chips in total and that we respect the color uniformity in each row and column. We can represent the configuration of the grid using binary choices for each row and column, where we choose a color or leave it empty. For each of the 5 rows, we can choose to have it filled with white chips, black chips, or be empty. This gives us 3 choices per row. The same applies for the columns. However, we must make sure that the combination of rows and columns does not lead to contradictions. After careful consideration of the constraints, we can derive that the total number of valid configurations is determined by the number of ways to choose the colors for the rows and columns while respecting the conditions given. Thus, the total number of configurations is 3^5 for rows multiplied by 3^5 for columns, leading to a final count of valid placements. Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is 59049.\n\nAnswer:59049",
