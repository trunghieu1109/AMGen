    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent TGSa:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how to place the chips such that all chips in the same row and column have the same color, and the placement is maximal without violating these conditions. Consider placing chips row by row and column by column, ensuring that each row and column is either all white or all black. Since the grid is 5x5, we can choose any number from 0 to 5 rows to be fully filled with white chips, and the remaining rows will be filled with black chips. Similarly, for columns, we can choose any number from 0 to 5 columns to be filled with white chips, and the remaining columns will be filled with black chips. However, the number of white rows must equal the number of white columns to maintain consistency (same color in each row and column intersection). Thus, the number of ways to choose k rows and k columns to be white is given by choosing k from 5 rows and k from 5 columns, which is \( \binom{5}{k}^2 \). Summing over all possible values of k from 0 to 5 gives the total number of configurations.

### thinking by Debate Agent WDJx:
To solve the problem, we need to ensure that each row and each column contains chips of only one color, and that no additional chip can be placed without violating the conditions. This implies that each row and column can either be fully filled with chips of one color or be completely empty. Since we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, one possible configuration is to fill some rows with white chips and the remaining rows with black chips, ensuring that the same number of rows and columns are filled with each color. The simplest way to achieve this is to fill a square subgrid of size k x k with one color and the rest of the grid with the other color, where k is an integer such that k^2 = 25. The only integer k that satisfies this is k=5, leading to a 5x5 grid entirely filled with one color. However, this does not use both colors. Another approach is to fill a 3x3 subgrid with one color and a 2x2 subgrid with the other color, making sure that the rows and columns do not overlap. This configuration ensures that all conditions are met, with no additional chips possible. We can choose 3 rows out of 5 and 3 columns out of 5 for one color, and the remaining 2 rows and 2 columns for the other color. The number of ways to choose 3 rows from 5 is C(5,3) and the same for columns. For the other color, we choose 2 rows and 2 columns, which is C(5,2) each. The product of these combinations gives the total number of configurations.

    <pre>The problem requires placing chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is filled with chips of only one color, and no additional chip can be placed without violating this condition. The key is to ensure that the number of rows filled with white chips equals the number of columns filled with white chips, and similarly for black chips. This means we can choose k rows to be white and k columns to be white, where k ranges from 0 to 5. For each k, the number of ways to choose k rows from 5 is C(5, k), and the same for columns. Thus, the number of configurations for each k is C(5, k)^2. Summing over all k from 0 to 5 gives the total number of configurations: C(5, 0)^2 + C(5, 1)^2 + C(5, 2)^2 + C(5, 3)^2 + C(5, 4)^2 + C(5, 5)^2 = 1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252.
