    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

### thinking by Debate Agent LqqO:
We parametrize a point X(t) on AB by X=(x,y)=((1−t)/2, (√3/2)t).  A segment PQ of unit length with P=(x1,0),Q=(0,y1) covers X iff for some s∈(0,1), x=x1(1−s), y=y1s and x1^2+y1^2=1.  This yields the equation f(s)=(1−t)^2/(1−s)^2+3t^2/s^2=4, which has the trivial root s=t for the segment AB itself.  Uniqueness of this root requires f′(t)=0.  Computing f′ gives 2/(1−t)−6/t=0, so t=3/4.  Then C=((1−3/4)/2, (√3/2)(3/4))=(1/8,3√3/8), giving OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=28/64=7/16.  Thus p+q=7+16=23.

### thinking by Debate Agent Sl8l:
We want the unique point C on the segment AB that lies on no other unit‐length segment PQ (with P on the x‐axis and Q on the y‐axis).  The union of all such segments is bounded by the envelope of the family of lines x⁄p + y⁄q = 1 with p²+q²=1.  Parametrizing p=cosθ, q=sinθ gives lines x secθ + y cscθ =1 whose envelope is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1, or (x,y)=(cos³θ,sin³θ).  The particular line AB corresponds to θ=60°, so its unique tangency point with the envelope is C=(cos³60°,sin³60°)=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.

    <pre>We need to find the unique point C on segment AB that is not covered by any other unit‐length segment PQ with P on the x‐axis and Q on the y‐axis.  Equivalently, the envelope of all such segments x/p + y/q = 1 (with p²+q²=1) is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1.  Segment AB corresponds to the line through A=(1/2,0) and B=(0,√3/2), which in slope form is x/(1/2)+y/(√3/2)=2+2y/√3=1 =&gt; x+y/√3=1/2 scaling; more directly, the normal direction corresponds to θ=60°, so the tangency point on the astroid is (cos³60°, sin³60°)=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
