    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

### thinking by Debate Agent DrnL:
We start by determining the coordinates of points A and B, which are A=(1/2, 0) and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The line segment AB can be described by finding its equation. The slope of line AB is given by (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). Thus, the equation of line AB can be expressed in point-slope form or slope-intercept form. We can also find the intersection of the line with the x-axis and y-axis to understand the limits of the segment. The family of segments 1PQ is defined by the distance formula, and we can express the coordinates of points P and Q as (x, 0) and (0, y) respectively, where x and y are determined by the unit length condition. By solving for the coordinates of point C on line AB that does not belong to any segment of length 1 in the first quadrant, we can use the distance formula and the line equation. After determining the coordinates of C, we can compute OC^2 and express it in the form p/q where p and q are coprime integers. Finally, we sum p and q to provide the final answer.

### thinking by Debate Agent xto9:
To find the point C on segment AB that does not belong to any segment from family F, we first need to define the coordinates of points A and B. The coordinates are A = (1/2, 0) and B = (0, sqrt(3)/2). The line segment AB can be described by the equation of the line connecting these two points. The slope of line AB is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). Thus, the equation of the line in point-slope form is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. The point C will be parametrized on the line segment AB as C = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). The distance from point P on the x-axis (x, 0) to point Q on the y-axis (0, y) must equal 1, leading to the equation sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1. Substituting y with -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 gives us a single equation in x. Solving this will give us the coordinates of point C, and subsequently, OC^2 can be computed. After solving for p and q, we will find their sum p + q.
