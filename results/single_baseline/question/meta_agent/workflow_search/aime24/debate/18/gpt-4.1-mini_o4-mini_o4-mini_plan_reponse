        "response": "We need to find the unique point C on segment AB that is not covered by any other unit\u2010length segment PQ with P on the x\u2010axis and Q on the y\u2010axis.  Equivalently, the envelope of all such segments x/p + y/q = 1 (with p\u00b2+q\u00b2=1) is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1.  Segment AB corresponds to the line through A=(1/2,0) and B=(0,\u221a3/2), which in slope form is x/(1/2)+y/(\u221a3/2)=2+2y/\u221a3=1 => x+y/\u221a3=1/2 scaling; more directly, the normal direction corresponds to \u03b8=60\u00b0, so the tangency point on the astroid is (cos\u00b360\u00b0, sin\u00b360\u00b0)=(1/8,3\u221a3/8).  Then OC\u00b2=(1/8)\u00b2+(3\u221a3/8)\u00b2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23",
