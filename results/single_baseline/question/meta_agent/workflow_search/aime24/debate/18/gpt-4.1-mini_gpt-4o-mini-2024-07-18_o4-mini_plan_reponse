        "response": "To find the unique point C on the line segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family F, we first determine the coordinates of points A and B, which are A=(1/2, 0) and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The line segment AB can be described by the equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. We parameterize point C on this line as C = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). The distance from point P on the x-axis (x, 0) to point Q on the y-axis (0, y) must equal 1, leading to the equation sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1. Substituting y with -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 gives us a single equation in x. Solving this will yield the coordinates of point C, and subsequently, we compute OC^2. After determining OC^2 in the form p/q where p and q are coprime integers, we find their sum p + q, which is 7.\n\nAnswer:7",
