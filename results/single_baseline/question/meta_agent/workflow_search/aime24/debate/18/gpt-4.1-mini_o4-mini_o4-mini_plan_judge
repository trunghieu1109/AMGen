Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We need to find the unique point C on segment AB that is not covered by any other unit‐length segment PQ with P on the x‐axis and Q on the y‐axis.  Equivalently, the envelope of all such segments x/p + y/q = 1 (with p²+q²=1) is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1.  Segment AB corresponds to the line through A=(1/2,0) and B=(0,√3/2), which in slope form is x/(1/2)+y/(√3/2)=2+2y/√3=1 => x+y/√3=1/2 scaling; more directly, the normal direction corresponds to θ=60°, so the tangency point on the astroid is (cos³60°, sin³60°)=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
