        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find the point C on the line segment AB that does not lie on any other segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The line segment AB is parameterized as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2) for t in [0, 1]. For a point C(t) to lie on a segment PQ, it must satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1, where x and y are the coordinates of C(t). Substituting the parameterization of C into this equation, we get ((1-t)/2)^2 + (t*sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1. Solving this equation for t will give the value of t for which C lies on a segment PQ of unit length. The unique value of t for which this does not hold will give us the required point C. After solving, we find that the point C that satisfies the conditions is C(1/3) = (1/3, sqrt(3)/6). The distance OC is sqrt((1/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2) = sqrt(7/36). Thus, OC^2 = 7/36, where p = 7 and q = 36. Therefore, p + q = 43.\n\nAnswer:43",
