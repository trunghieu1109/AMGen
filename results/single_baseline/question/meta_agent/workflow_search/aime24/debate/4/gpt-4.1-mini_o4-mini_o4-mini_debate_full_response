Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent o9j4', content='We need the smallest prime p for which there exists n with p²|n⁴+1. Testing small primes shows p must be ≡1 mod 8; the smallest such is p=17. Solve n⁴≡−1 mod 17 to get solutions n≡2,8,9,15. Each lifts uniquely to mod 17²=289 via Hensel’s lemma. The lifts give m≡155,110,179,134 mod 289 respectively, so the least positive m is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Checking small primes: p=2,3,5,7,11,13 fail; the first p≡1 mod8 is 17, and indeed x^4≡−1 mod17 has solutions x≡2,8,9,15. By Hensel each lifts uniquely to mod17^2=289. Lifting n0=2,8,9,15 yields minimal positive solutions m=155,110,179,134 respectively. The smallest is 110.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent WIiW:\nWe seek the smallest prime p with p^2 dividing some n^4+1. Test p=2,3,5,7,11,13 and find none work; the theory of 4th‐power residues shows p≡1 mod 8, so the smallest is p=17. Solve n^4≡−1 mod 17 to get n≡8,9 mod 17, then lift each solution to mod 289 via Hensel’s lemma. For n₀=8 we find n≡110 mod 289; for n₀=9 we find n≡179 mod 289. The least positive m is 110.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vILe:\n110\n\n### answer by Debate Agent WIiW:\n110\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
