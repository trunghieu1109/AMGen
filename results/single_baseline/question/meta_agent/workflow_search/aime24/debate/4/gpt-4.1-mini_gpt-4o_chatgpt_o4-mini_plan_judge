proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. This means we need n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For this to be possible, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. First, consider modulo p. For -1 to be a fourth power residue modulo p, it must be a quadratic residue, which is true if p ≡ 1 (mod 4). The smallest prime satisfying p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is 5. Now, we need to check if there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 3 works because 3^4 = 81 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Therefore, the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is 3.
