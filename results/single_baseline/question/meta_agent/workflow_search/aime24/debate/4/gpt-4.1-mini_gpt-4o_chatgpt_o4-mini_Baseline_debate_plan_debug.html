    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking by Debate Agent ywam:
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists an integer \( n \) for which \( p^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \). First, let&#39;s explore the condition \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). Thus, \( n \) is an 8th root of unity modulo \( p^2 \). For this to hold, \( p \) must divide \( n^8 - 1 = (n^4 - 1)(n^4 + 1) \). However, \( p \) cannot divide both \( n^4 - 1 \) and \( n^4 + 1 \) simultaneously unless \( p = 2 \), which is not a prime number we are interested in since \( 2^2 = 4 \) and doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. Hence, we need a prime \( p \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). We start checking small primes: for \( p = 5 \), we have \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). By Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem, \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). This means \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \) is possible. Now, we check for the smallest \( m \). Assume \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \). Solving this, we find that \( n = 3 \) works because \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \). Therefore, the smallest \( m \) is 3.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We start by considering the expression n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means that -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. First, let&#39;s consider modulo p. We need -1 to be a fourth power residue modulo p. For this to happen, -1 must be a quadratic residue modulo p, which is true if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 4). The smallest prime satisfying p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is 5. Now, we need to check if there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25). We test small values of n to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25.
