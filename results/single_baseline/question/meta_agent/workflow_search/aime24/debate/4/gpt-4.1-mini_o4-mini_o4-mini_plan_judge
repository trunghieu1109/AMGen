Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest prime p for which there exists n with p²|n⁴+1. Testing small primes shows p must be ≡1 mod 8; the smallest such is p=17. Solve n⁴≡−1 mod 17 to get solutions n≡2,8,9,15. Each lifts uniquely to mod 17²=289 via Hensel’s lemma. The lifts give m≡155,110,179,134 mod 289 respectively, so the least positive m is 110.
