proposed answer: To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by checking small prime numbers. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4. For p = 3, checking n = 1, 2, and 3 shows none yield n^4 + 1 divisible by 9. For p = 5, checking n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 shows n = 4 gives 4^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. For p = 7, checking n = 3 gives 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 49. For p = 11, checking n = 5 gives 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 121. Thus, the least prime p is 11. Now, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 121. Checking m = 5, we find that 5^4 + 1 = 626 is divisible by 121. Therefore, the answer is 5.
