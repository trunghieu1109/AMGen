    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking by Debate Agent dlCd:
To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by checking small prime numbers. We will check p = 2, 3, 5, etc. We need to find n such that n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) does not hold for any n. For p = 3, we check n = 1, 2, ... and find that n = 2 works since 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 9. For p = 5, n = 2 gives 2^4 + 1 = 17, not divisible by 25. However, for p = 5 and n = 3, we find 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. Continuing this way, we find that p = 13 works since n = 5 gives 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 169. The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 169 is m = 5.

### thinking by Debate Agent V5l2:
To find the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by analyzing the expression n^4 + 1. We can rewrite n^4 + 1 as (n^2)^2 + 1. We need to check various primes and see if we can find an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We will check small primes one by one. Starting with p = 2, we find that n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4. Next, for p = 3, we check n = 1, 2, and 3 and find that none yield n^4 + 1 divisible by 9. For p = 5, we check n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 and find that n = 4 gives us 4^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. Next, we check p = 7, which gives us n = 3, and we find that 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 49. Finally, for p = 11, we check n = 5, and find that 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 121. Thus, the least prime p is 11. Now we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 121. Checking m = 5, we find that 5^4 + 1 is divisible by 121. Therefore, the answer is 5.
