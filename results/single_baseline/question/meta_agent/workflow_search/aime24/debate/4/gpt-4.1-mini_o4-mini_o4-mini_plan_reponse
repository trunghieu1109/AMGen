        "response": "We need the smallest prime p for which there exists n with p\u00b2|n\u2074+1. Testing small primes shows p must be \u22611 mod 8; the smallest such is p=17. Solve n\u2074\u2261\u22121 mod 17 to get solutions n\u22612,8,9,15. Each lifts uniquely to mod 17\u00b2=289 via Hensel\u2019s lemma. The lifts give m\u2261155,110,179,134 mod 289 respectively, so the least positive m is 110.\n\nAnswer:110",
