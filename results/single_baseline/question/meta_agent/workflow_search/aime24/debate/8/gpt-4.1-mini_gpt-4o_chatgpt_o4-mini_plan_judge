Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice. A losing position for Alice is one where any move she makes leaves Bob in a winning position. We start by identifying the base cases: n = 0 is a losing position for Alice because she cannot make a move. For n = 1, Alice can take 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 2, Alice can take 1 token leaving n = 1 and win, so n = 2 is a winning position. For n = 3, Alice can take 1 token leaving n = 2 and win, so n = 3 is a winning position. For n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens leaving n = 1 and win, so n = 5 is a winning position. However, for n = 6, Alice can only leave Bob with n = 5 or n = 2, both of which are winning positions for Bob. Thus, n = 6 is a losing position for Alice and a winning position for Bob. Continuing this pattern, we find that the losing positions for Alice (and winning for Bob) occur at n = 5k + 1 for k = 1, 2, 3, .... Up to n = 2024, we calculate the number of such positions. The positions are 6, 11, 16, ..., which are of the form 5k + 1. We need to find the largest k such that 5k + 1 <= 2024. Solving 5k + 1 <= 2024 gives 5k <= 2023, so k <= 404. Therefore, there are 404 such positions.
