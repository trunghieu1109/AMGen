Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we analyze the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is losing for the player whose turn it is if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. We find that positions where n is 0, 4, 8 are losing positions. By identifying the pattern of losing positions, we can count them up to 2024. The losing positions are those that can be expressed in the form of 4k for non-negative integers k. We calculate the number of such positions up to 2024 and find that there are 506 losing positions. Therefore, Bob has a winning strategy for 506 values of n less than or equal to 2024.
