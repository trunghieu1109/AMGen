        "problem": "Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",

        "response": "In the take-1-or-4 subtraction game, the P-positions (losing for the player about to move) satisfy n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5. Bob wins if the initial position is a P-position. We count positive n \u2264 2024 with n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5): multiples of 5 up to 2024 give \u230a2024/5\u230b = 404; numbers \u22612 mod 5 up to 2024 give \u230a(2024\u22122)/5\u230b+1 = 405. Total = 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nAnswer:809",
