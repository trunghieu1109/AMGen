    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent gDXj:
To determine the values of n for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions for Alice. A losing position for Alice means that no matter what move she makes, she will leave Bob in a winning position. A winning position for Bob is one where he can move to a losing position for Alice. We start by identifying the base cases: if n = 0, Alice loses because she cannot make a move. Thus, n = 0 is a losing position for Alice. For n = 1, Alice can take 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 2, Alice can take 1 token leaving n = 1 and win, so n = 2 is a winning position. For n = 3, Alice can take 1 token leaving n = 2 and win, so n = 3 is a winning position. For n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens leaving n = 1 and win, so n = 5 is a winning position. However, for n = 6, Alice can only leave Bob with n = 5 or n = 2, both of which are winning positions for Bob. Thus, n = 6 is a losing position for Alice and a winning position for Bob. Continuing this pattern, we find that the losing positions for Alice (and winning for Bob) occur at n = 6, 11, 16, 21, ..., i.e., n = 5k + 1 for k = 1, 2, 3, .... Up to n = 2024, we calculate the number of such positions.

### thinking by Debate Agent ffGm:
To solve this problem, we need to determine for which values of n Bob can guarantee a win. We start by identifying the losing positions. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. 

1. If n = 0, Bob wins because Alice cannot make a move. So, n = 0 is a losing position for Alice.
2. If n = 1, Alice can take 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position for Alice.
3. If n = 2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. So, n = 2 is a winning position for Alice.
4. If n = 3, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, who then wins. So, n = 3 is a winning position for Alice.
5. If n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position for Alice.
6. If n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. So, n = 5 is a winning position for Alice.

Now, consider n = 6:
- If Alice takes 1 token, Bob is left with 5, a winning position for Alice.
- If Alice takes 4 tokens, Bob is left with 2, a winning position for Alice.

Thus, n = 6 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. We continue this pattern to find all losing positions up to n = 2024.

The pattern is that every 5th number starting from 0 is a losing position: 0, 6, 11, 16, ..., etc.

We need to calculate the number of such losing positions up to 2024.

The losing positions are of the form 5k + 1 for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., where 5k + 1 &lt;= 2024.

5k &lt;= 2023, so k &lt;= 404.

Thus, there are 405 losing positions (including k = 0).

Therefore, there are 404 such positions.
