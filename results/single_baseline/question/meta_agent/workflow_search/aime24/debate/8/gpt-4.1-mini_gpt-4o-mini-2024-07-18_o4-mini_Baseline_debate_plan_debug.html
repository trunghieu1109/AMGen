    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent IKCs:
To determine the winning and losing positions for Bob, we analyze the game&#39;s structure. A position is winning for the player whose turn it is if they can force a win no matter how the opponent plays. Conversely, a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. We categorize positions based on the number of tokens left: if Alice can move to a position that is losing for Bob, she can guarantee her win. We will compute the winning and losing positions for values of n up to 2024. We find that positions where n is 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 are winning for Alice, while positions 0, 4, 8 are losing. We can derive a pattern from these losing positions and count them up to 2024.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0rTL:
To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is a losing position for the player whose turn it is if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there is at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Starting from small values of n, we can identify the losing positions and count them up to 2024.

    <pre>To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we analyze the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is losing for the player whose turn it is if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. We find that positions where n is 0, 4, 8 are losing positions. By identifying the pattern of losing positions, we can count them up to 2024. The losing positions are those that can be expressed in the form of 4k for non-negative integers k. We calculate the number of such positions up to 2024 and find that there are 506 losing positions. Therefore, Bob has a winning strategy for 506 values of n less than or equal to 2024.
