    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent xLax:
We compute P-positions (losing for the player to move) for the take-1-or-4 game. By recurrence one finds they are exactly n ≡0 or 2 mod 5. For 1≤n≤2024 there are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 (n≡0) and 405 values ≡2 mod 5, totaling 809.

### thinking by Debate Agent FX0T:
We have a take‐away game with moves {1,4}. P‐positions (positions losing for the next player) satisfy that none of the moves lead to a P‐position. Computing small values gives P‐positions at n = 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,… with differences alternating 2,3. One finds the closed form: P = {5m,5m+2}. For positive n≤2024, we count n≡0 or 2 mod5. Count of n≡0 mod5 is ⌊2024/5⌋ =404. Count of n≡2 mod5 is ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1 =404+1=405. Total =404+405=809.

    <pre>In the take-1-or-4 subtraction game, the P-positions (losing for the player about to move) satisfy n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5. Bob wins if the initial position is a P-position. We count positive n ≤ 2024 with n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5): multiples of 5 up to 2024 give ⌊2024/5⌋ = 404; numbers ≡2 mod 5 up to 2024 give ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1 = 405. Total = 404 + 405 = 809.
