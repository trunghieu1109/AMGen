    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent wepr:
Let walking time + coffee time equations be 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting gives 9(1/s−1/(s+2)) = 1.6 ⇒ 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 ⇒ s^2+2s−11.25 = 0 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h. Then t/60 = 4−9/2.5 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 min. For speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 h = 180 min, plus 24 min coffee = 204 min.

### thinking by Debate Agent D7hA:
Let T₁=240 min and T₂=144 min be total times including coffee break t. Walking time at speed s is 9/s hours = (540/s) minutes, so t=240−540/s. At speed s+2, t=144−540/(s+2). Equate: 240−540/s=144−540/(s+2) ⇒ 96=1080/[s(s+2)] ⇒ s(s+2)=11.25 ⇒ s=2.5 km/h. Then t=240−540/2.5=24 min. At speed s+0.5=3 km/h, walking time=9/3=3 h=180 min, so total=180+24=204 min.

    <pre>Let s be Aya’s walking speed in km/h and t the coffee time in minutes. From 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4, subtracting gives 9(1/s − 1/(s+2)) = 1.6 or 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 ⇒ s^2 + 2s = 11.25 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h. Then t/60 = 4 − 9/2.5 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24 min. At speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time is 9/3 = 3 h = 180 min, so total = 180 + 24 = 204 min.
