Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find Aya's walking speed s and the time t spent in the coffee shop. We have two scenarios: 1) Aya walks at s km/h and the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 4 - t/60 hours, so 9/s = 4 - t/60. 2) Aya walks at s+2 km/h and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (2.4 hours), including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours, so 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these equations, we find s = 3 km/h and t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s+1/2 km/h, her speed is 3.5 km/h. The walking time is 9/3.5 hours, which is approximately 2.5714 hours or 2 hours and 34 minutes. Including the 60 minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 3 hours and 34 minutes, or 214 minutes.
