    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2SsT:
First, we need to determine Aya&#39;s walking speed, s, and the time spent in the coffee shop, t. We have two equations based on the given conditions. When she walks at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 4 - t/60 hours. Since the distance is 9 km, we have 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours. So, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. We solve these two equations to find s and t. From the first equation, t = 240 - 60(9/s). From the second equation, t = 144 - 60(9/(s+2)). Setting these expressions for t equal gives 240 - 60(9/s) = 144 - 60(9/(s+2)). Solving for s, we find s = 3. With s = 3, we can find t by substituting back into one of the equations, t = 240 - 60(9/3) = 240 - 180 = 60. Now, we find the time it takes when she walks at s+1/2 km/h. The walking speed is 3.5 km/h, so the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. This is 2.5714 hours, which is approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes. Including the t minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 2 hours and 34 minutes plus 60 minutes, which is 3 hours and 34 minutes, or 214 minutes.

To solve for Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop, we set up equations based on the information given. When Aya walks at a speed of s km/h, the total time including the coffee shop visit is 4 hours, so the walking time is 4 - t/60 hours. The equation is 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (2.4 hours), so the walking time is 2.4 - t/60. The equation is 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these equations gives us s = 3 km/h and t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s+1/2 km/h, her walking speed is 3.5 km/h. The walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Adding the coffee shop time, the total time is 9/3.5 + 1 hours in minutes.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find Aya&#39;s walking speed s and the time t spent in the coffee shop. We have two scenarios: 1) Aya walks at s km/h and the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 4 - t/60 hours, so 9/s = 4 - t/60. 2) Aya walks at s+2 km/h and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (2.4 hours), including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours, so 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these equations, we find s = 3 km/h and t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s+1/2 km/h, her speed is 3.5 km/h. The walking time is 9/3.5 hours, which is approximately 2.5714 hours or 2 hours and 34 minutes. Including the 60 minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 3 hours and 34 minutes, or 214 minutes.
