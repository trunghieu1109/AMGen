The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "To find the probability that the blue vertices can be rotated to occupy the positions of the red vertices in a regular octagon, we first note that a regular octagon has 8 vertices. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue with equal probability, which means there are a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. For the blue vertices to occupy the positions of the red vertices after some rotation, the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, or if they are unequal, the configuration must allow for a rotational symmetry where blue can map to red. This can only happen if the number of blue vertices is a divisor of 8, which are 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 blue vertices. We will calculate the probability for each case and sum these probabilities. The counts for each case are calculated using binomial coefficients and the total configurations are considered. The final probability is expressed in simplest form as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m+n. The valid cases are: 1. For k = 0 (all red), there is 1 way to color. 2. For k = 8 (all blue), there is also 1 way to color. 3. For k = 4 (4 blue and 4 red), the blue vertices must be positioned in such a way that they can be rotated into the red positions. The arrangements of 4 blue vertices can be chosen in C(8, 4) = 70 ways, but only those that form a rotation-invariant pattern (like alternating colors) will count. The valid patterns for k = 4 are those where the blue vertices occupy every second vertex, which can be done in 2 ways (starting at vertex 1 or vertex 2). Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is 1 (k=0) + 1 (k=8) + 2 (k=4) = 4. The probability is then 4/256 = 1/64. Thus, m = 1 and n = 64, and they are relatively prime. Therefore, m+n = 1+64 = 65.\n\nAnswer:65",
