Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We need the probability that a random subset S⊆Z/8 (the blue vertices) has S∩(S+k)=∅ for some nonzero rotation k.  Equivalently, letting E_k={S: S∩(S+k)=∅}, k=1…4 (rotations by 8−k give the same condition), we compute |⋃E_k| by inclusion–exclusion.  One finds:
A₁=47, A₂=49, A₃=47, A₄=81,  ΣA_i=224
Pairwise intersections: 21,31,35,21,37,35 sum to 180
Triple intersections: 13,17,17,17 sum to 64
All four: 9
Hence |⋃E_k|=224−180+64−9=99.  Total subsets=256, so probability=99/256=m/n with m+n=99+256=355.
