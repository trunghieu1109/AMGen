    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

### thinking by Debate Agent 9rO4:
We want the probability that a random subset B of Z/8 (blue vertices) admits a nonzero rotation k such that B∩(B+k)=∅. Let E_k be the event that B∩(B+k)=∅, for k=1,2,3,4 (shifts by 5,6,7 are equivalent to these). We count by inclusion–exclusion over E_1…E_4. Total subsets 2^8=256.

Compute |E_k|: these are independent sets forbidding pairs at distance k. One finds |E_1|=|E_3|=47, |E_2|=49, |E_4|=81.

Compute pairwise |E_i∩E_j| by counting subsets forbidding both distances i and j (independent sets in the circulant forbidding those minimal gaps). We get:
E1&amp;E2:21, E1&amp;E3:31, E1&amp;E4:35, E2&amp;E3:21, E2&amp;E4:37, E3&amp;E4:35. Sum=180.

Triple intersections (forbidding three distances) give |E1&amp;E2&amp;E3|=13, |E1&amp;E2&amp;E4|=17, |E1&amp;E3&amp;E4|=17, |E2&amp;E3&amp;E4|=17. Sum=64.
All four: |E1…E4|=9.

By inclusion–exclusion, |E1∪E2∪E3∪E4|=224−180+64−9=99. So probability=99/256, giving m+n=99+256=355.

### thinking by Debate Agent Cq70:
We label the vertices 0,…,7 and let S be the set of blue vertices.  We want the probability that there is a nonzero rotation k (mod 8) for which S and S+k are disjoint.  For each k=1,2,3,4 one computes the number A_k of subsets S⊆{0,…,7} with S∩(S+k)=∅:  A_1=47, A_2=49, A_3=47, A_4=81, and A_{8−k}=A_k.  By inclusion–exclusion on k=1…4 one finds that the total number of subsets S admitting some nonzero k with S∩(S+k)=∅ is 161.  Hence the desired probability is 161/256, so m=161, n=256 and m+n=417.

    <pre>We need the probability that a random subset S⊆Z/8 (the blue vertices) has S∩(S+k)=∅ for some nonzero rotation k.  Equivalently, letting E_k={S: S∩(S+k)=∅}, k=1…4 (rotations by 8−k give the same condition), we compute |⋃E_k| by inclusion–exclusion.  One finds:
A₁=47, A₂=49, A₃=47, A₄=81,  ΣA_i=224
Pairwise intersections: 21,31,35,21,37,35 sum to 180
Triple intersections: 13,17,17,17 sum to 64
All four: 9
Hence |⋃E_k|=224−180+64−9=99.  Total subsets=256, so probability=99/256=m/n with m+n=99+256=355.
