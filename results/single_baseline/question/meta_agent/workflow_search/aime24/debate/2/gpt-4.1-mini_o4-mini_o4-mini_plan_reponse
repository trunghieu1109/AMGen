The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

Equivalently, letting E_k={S: S\u2229(S+k)=\u2205}, k=1\u20264 (rotations by 8\u2212k give the same condition), we compute |\u22c3E_k| by inclusion\u2013exclusion.
