Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves coloring the vertices of a regular octagon and considering its rotational symmetries. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue, leading to 2^8 total colorings. We need the octagon to be rotatable such that all blue vertices align with positions that were originally red. This requires the number of blue and red vertices to be equal, i.e., 4 blue and 4 red. Using Burnside's Lemma, we calculate the number of distinct colorings invariant under the octagon's rotations. The identity rotation allows all 70 colorings, while the 90° and 270° rotations allow 2 alternating colorings each. The 180° rotation allows 6 colorings with opposite pairs the same color. Other rotations allow no invariant colorings. Thus, the number of distinct colorings is (70 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 2 + 0) / 8 = 10. The probability is 10 / 70 = 1/7, so m = 1 and n = 7, giving m+n = 8.
