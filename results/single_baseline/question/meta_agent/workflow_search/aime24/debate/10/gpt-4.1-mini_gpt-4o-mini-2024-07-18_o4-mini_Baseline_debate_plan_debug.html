    <pre>Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

### thinking by Debate Agent FQt5:
Given the rectangles, we know the lengths of their sides. The configuration suggests that we can use the properties of circles and rectangles to find the length of CE. Since A, D, H, and G lie on a circle, and D, E, C, F are collinear, we can set up a relationship between the dimensions of the rectangles. Using the dimensions of rectangle ABCD, we can find the coordinates of points C and E. Then, we can find the length of CE using the distance formula.

### thinking by Debate Agent RRwz:
To find the length of CE, we first need to identify the relationships between the rectangles and the points given. Since points D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can set up a coordinate system. We can place point A at (0, 0), point B at (0, 107), point C at (16, 107), and point D at (16, 0). Given that D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can place point E on the line extending from D to C. Since we have the lengths of the rectangles, we can determine the coordinates of points H and G as well. The lengths FG and EF give us the dimensions of rectangle EFGH. We can then calculate the coordinates of points F and G. Finally, we can determine the length CE by finding the distance between points C and E using the distance formula.

    <pre>To find the length of CE, we need to analyze the configuration of the rectangles and the points. We know that rectangles ABCD and EFGH have specific dimensions and that points D, E, C, and F are collinear. We can place point A at (0, 0), point B at (0, 107), point C at (16, 107), and point D at (16, 0). Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can express E in terms of the coordinates of D and C. The lengths of the sides of rectangle EFGH (FG = 17 and EF = 184) will help us determine the coordinates of points E, F, G, and H. By calculating the coordinates and using the distance formula, we can find the length of CE. After careful consideration of the dimensions and the relationships between the points, the length of CE is determined to be 184, as it corresponds to the distance from point C to point E along the collinear line.
