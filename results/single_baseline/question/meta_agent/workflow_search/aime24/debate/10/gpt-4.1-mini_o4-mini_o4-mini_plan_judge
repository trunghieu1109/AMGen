Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D, E, C, F are collinear on y=16, let E=(e,16) and F=(e+184,16). Rectangle EFGH has FG perpendicular to EF with FG=17, so taking the upward orientation gives G=(e+184,33) and H=(e,33). Points A, D, G, H must be concyclic. The perpendicular bisector of AD is x=0+?, but requiring H and G to be equidistant from the center yields the condition e^2+184e−561=0 with solutions e=3 or e=−187. The order D–E–C–F on the line demands e=3, so E=(3,16). Thus CE = 107−3 = 104.
