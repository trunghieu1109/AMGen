Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the length of CE, we need to analyze the configuration of the rectangles and the points. We know that rectangles ABCD and EFGH have specific dimensions and that points D, E, C, and F are collinear. We can place point A at (0, 0), point B at (0, 107), point C at (16, 107), and point D at (16, 0). Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can express E in terms of the coordinates of D and C. The lengths of the sides of rectangle EFGH (FG = 17 and EF = 184) will help us determine the coordinates of points E, F, G, and H. By calculating the coordinates and using the distance formula, we can find the length of CE. After careful consideration of the dimensions and the relationships between the points, the length of CE is determined to be 184, as it corresponds to the distance from point C to point E along the collinear line.
