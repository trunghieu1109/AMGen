In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "Let A, B, C, D be the sets of residents owning a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts respectively, with |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562, |D|=900, and total residents N=900. Every resident owns candy hearts, so D is the entire population. Let n_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of these 4 items. We are given n_2=437, n_3=234, and we seek n_4. We also have n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4=900 and the sum of all possessions equals |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals 1*n_1+2*n_2+3*n_3+4*n_4. Set up the equations:\n1) n_1 + 437 + 234 + n_4 = 900  => n_1 + n_4 = 229\n2) n_1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*n_4 = 2024  => n_1 + 874 + 702 + 4n_4 = 2024  => n_1 + 4n_4 = 448\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 3n_4 = 219, so n_4 = 73.\n\nAnswer:73",
