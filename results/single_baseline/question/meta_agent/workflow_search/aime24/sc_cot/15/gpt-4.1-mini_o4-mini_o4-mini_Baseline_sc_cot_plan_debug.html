    <pre>Let A, B, C, D be the sets of residents owning a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts respectively, with |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562, |D|=900, and total residents N=900. Every resident owns candy hearts, so D is the entire population. Let n_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of these 4 items. We are given n_2=437, n_3=234, and we seek n_4. We also have n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4=900 and the sum of all possessions equals |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals 1*n_1+2*n_2+3*n_3+4*n_4. Set up the equations:
1) n_1 + 437 + 234 + n_4 = 900  =&gt; n_1 + n_4 = 229
2) n_1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*n_4 = 2024  =&gt; n_1 + 874 + 702 + 4n_4 = 2024  =&gt; n_1 + 4n_4 = 448
Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 3n_4 = 219, so n_4 = 73.
