    <pre>We are given the total number of residents and the number of residents who own each item. We also know the number of residents who own exactly two and exactly three items. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items. Let A, B, C, and D represent the sets of residents who own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts, respectively. We know |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562, and |D| = 900 (since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts). The number of residents who own exactly two items is 437, and those who own exactly three items is 234. We want to find the number of residents who own all four items, denoted as |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given information to set up equations. The total number of residents who own at least one of the items A, B, or C is given by |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We also know that |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| = |A ∩ B ∩ C| since D includes everyone. We have |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 900 since everyone owns at least one item. We have |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - 2|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 437, and |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 + |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. Solving these equations will give us the number of residents who own all four items.
