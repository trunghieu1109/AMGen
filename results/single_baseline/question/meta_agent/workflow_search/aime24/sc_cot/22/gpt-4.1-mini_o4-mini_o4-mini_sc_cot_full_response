Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2TSK', content='We need an even-length list (median integer not in list). Let the count of 9’s be f≥2. Sum of all entries=30. Try f=2 and n=4: rest two sum to12. Possible pairs: (5,7) gives list [5,7,9,9] with median=(7+9)/2=8, integer not in list, unique mode=9. Other lengths or f>2 fail. Thus the list is [5,7,9,9], and sum of squares is 25+49+81+81=236.\n\nAnswer:236', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
