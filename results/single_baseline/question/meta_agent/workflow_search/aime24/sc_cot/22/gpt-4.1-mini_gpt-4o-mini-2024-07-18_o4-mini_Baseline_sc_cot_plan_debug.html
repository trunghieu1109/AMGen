    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions. The list must sum to 30, have 9 as the unique mode, and have a median that is a positive integer not included in the list. Let&#39;s denote the list as having &#39;n&#39; items, where &#39;m&#39; is the number of times 9 appears, and the rest of the items are chosen to meet the conditions. The unique mode condition indicates that 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. The median condition will guide our choice of other numbers. We will explore possible combinations of numbers and calculate the required sum of squares.
