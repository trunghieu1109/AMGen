Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions. The conditions are: the sum of the list is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. 

Start by considering the mode condition: 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's assume 9 appears at least twice, as it is the mode. 

Next, consider the median condition. If the median is not in the list and is a positive integer, the list must have an even number of elements so that the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The simplest case is a list with 4 elements, but 9 being the mode and sum being 30 make it unlikely. 

Let's try with 6 elements: 

- If the list has 6 elements, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Since the median is not in the list, it is not an integer in the list. Thus, we can try: [a, b, 9, 9, c, d] where a, b, c, d are integers such that the sum is 30 and 9 is the mode.

- We know 9 + 9 = 18, so a + b + c + d = 12.

- To satisfy the mode condition, 9 must appear more than any other number. We can try a = 1, b = 2, c = 8, d = 10, which gives us: [1, 2, 9, 9, 8, 10].

- The median of this list is (9 + 8) / 2 = 8.5, which is not an integer, so let's adjust.

- Try: [1, 3, 9, 9, 4, 4]. This gives the sum as 30, mode as 9, and the median (3 + 9) / 2 = 6, which is not in the list.

- This list satisfies all conditions. Now calculate the sum of squares: 1^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + 4^2.

- Sum of squares = 1 + 9 + 81 + 81 + 16 + 16 = 204.
