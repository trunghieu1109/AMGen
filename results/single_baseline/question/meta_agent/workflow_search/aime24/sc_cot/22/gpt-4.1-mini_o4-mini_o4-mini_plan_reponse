        "response": "We need an even-length list (median integer not in list). Let the count of 9\u2019s be f\u22652. Sum of all entries=30. Try f=2 and n=4: rest two sum to12. Possible pairs: (5,7) gives list [5,7,9,9] with median=(7+9)/2=8, integer not in list, unique mode=9. Other lengths or f>2 fail. Thus the list is [5,7,9,9], and sum of squares is 25+49+81+81=236.\n\nAnswer:236",
