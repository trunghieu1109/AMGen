        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions. The list must sum to 30, have 9 as the unique mode, and have a median that is a positive integer not included in the list. Let's denote the list as having 'n' items, where 'm' is the number of times 9 appears, and the rest of the items are chosen to meet the conditions. The unique mode condition indicates that 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. The median condition will guide our choice of other numbers. We will explore possible combinations of numbers and calculate the required sum of squares.\n\nAnswer:486",
