Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the system of equations, we will first rewrite each logarithmic equation in exponential form. The equations are: 
1. \( \log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \) implies \( \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2} \) which gives \( x = yz\sqrt{2} \).

2. \( \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \) implies \( \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \) which gives \( y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3} \).

3. \( \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \) implies \( \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \) which gives \( z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4} \).

Next, we will substitute the expressions for \( x, y, z \) into each other to find a relationship among them. After substituting, we can express all variables in terms of one variable, say \( x \), and then calculate \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \). We will find \( y \) and \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and then compute \( x^4y^3z^2 \). Finally, we will compute \( \left| \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \right| \) and express it as \( \frac{m}{n} \) and find \( m+n \).
