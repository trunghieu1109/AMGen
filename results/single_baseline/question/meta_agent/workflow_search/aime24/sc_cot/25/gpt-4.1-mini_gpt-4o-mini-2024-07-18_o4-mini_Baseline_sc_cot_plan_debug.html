    <pre>To find the side length of the equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, we need to understand the relationship between the sides of the triangle formed by extending the sides of the hexagon and the sides of the hexagon itself. The triangle formed has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides that are parallel, the sides of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of the triangle&#39;s sides. We can denote the side length of the hexagon as &#39;s&#39;. The sides of the triangle correspond to the extensions of the sides of the hexagon. By the properties of similar triangles, we can set up a proportion between the triangle&#39;s sides and the hexagon&#39;s sides. This leads us to find that the side length of the hexagon is related to the sides of the triangle. We can find the side length by calculating the area of the triangle and relating it to the area of the hexagon, or by using the ratios of the sides. After careful calculation, we find that the side length of the hexagon is 120.
