    <pre>The problem describes a special type of hexagon known as a &#39;parallelohexagon&#39;, where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Given that the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300, we can determine the side length of the hexagon by considering the properties of such a hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are the differences of the hexagon&#39;s side lengths due to the parallel and equal nature of opposite sides. Let the side length of the hexagon be x. The segments formed by extending AB, CD, and EF are equal to the differences in lengths of the opposite sides of the hexagon. Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are given by |x - x|, |x - x|, and |x - x|, which simplifies to x, x, and x. Hence, the perimeter of the triangle is 3x. The perimeter of the triangle is also given by the sum of its side lengths, 200 + 240 + 300 = 740. Setting 3x = 740, we solve for x.
