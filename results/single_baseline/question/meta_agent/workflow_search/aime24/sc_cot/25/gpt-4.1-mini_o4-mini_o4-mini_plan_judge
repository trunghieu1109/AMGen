Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We model the convex equi-lateral, opposite-sides-parallel hexagon by consecutive vectors v1,v2,v3 of equal length s, with the remaining three given by v4=−v1,v5=−v2,v6=−v3.  One shows by computing the three vertices where the supporting lines of AB (direction v1), CD (v3) and EF (v5=−v2) meet that the resulting triangle has side lengths L1,L2,L3 given in terms of s and the angles between v1,v2,v3.  A somewhat involved trigonometric argument (or use of support‐function formulas) then yields the reciprocal relation 1/s=1/L1+1/L2+1/L3.  Substituting L1=200, L2=240, L3=300 gives 1/s=1/200+1/240+1/300=1/80, so s=80.
