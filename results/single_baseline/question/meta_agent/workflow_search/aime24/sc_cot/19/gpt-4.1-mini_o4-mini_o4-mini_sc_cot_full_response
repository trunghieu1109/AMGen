Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1qMA', content='Let ω^k run over all 13th roots of unity. Write 2−2x+x^2=(x−a)(x−b) with a=1+i, b=1−i. Then ∏(ω^k−a)=−(a^13−1), ∏(ω^k−b)=−(b^13−1), so P=(a^13−1)(b^13−1). Compute a^13=(√2 e^{iπ/4})^13=−64−64i, b^13=−64+64i, hence P=(−65−64i)(−65+64i)=8321. Mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nAnswer:321', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
