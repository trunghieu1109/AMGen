Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we begin by simplifying the expression inside the product. The term we are examining is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^(2k). We can rewrite this as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^(2k). Next, we note that ω is a 13th root of unity, which means that ω^13 = 1 and for k = 0 to 12, ω^k takes on all 13th roots of unity. We can also use the fact that the roots of unity satisfy the polynomial equation x^13 - 1 = 0. This means that ω^k can be represented in terms of the roots of unity. We will calculate the product by recognizing patterns in the roots of unity. The product can be evaluated by substituting ω^k into the polynomial and considering the roots. After simplification, we can evaluate the product and find the remainder when divided by 1000.
