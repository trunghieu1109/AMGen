        "response": "To solve the problem, we begin by simplifying the expression inside the product. The term we are examining is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^(2k). We can rewrite this as 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^(2k). Next, we note that \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, which means that \u03c9^13 = 1 and for k = 0 to 12, \u03c9^k takes on all 13th roots of unity. We can also use the fact that the roots of unity satisfy the polynomial equation x^13 - 1 = 0. This means that \u03c9^k can be represented in terms of the roots of unity. We will calculate the product by recognizing patterns in the roots of unity. The product can be evaluated by substituting \u03c9^k into the polynomial and considering the roots. After simplification, we can evaluate the product and find the remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nAnswer:0",
