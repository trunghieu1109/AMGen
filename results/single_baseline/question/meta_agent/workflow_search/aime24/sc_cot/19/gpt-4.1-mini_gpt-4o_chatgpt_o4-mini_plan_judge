Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that the 13th roots of unity satisfy the equation \( x^{13} = 1 \), and since \( \omega \neq 1 \), we have \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq 12 \). The key observation is that \( \omega^k \) are the roots of the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). We need to simplify the expression inside the product: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1-\omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \). Notice that this expression simplifies to \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2 = 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \). We can use symmetry and properties of roots of unity to simplify the product. By symmetry, if \( \omega^k \) is a root, then \( \omega^{13-k} \) is also a root and they pair up nicely. The roots of unity sum to zero, and we can use this to simplify the product. After simplifying, we find that the product is equal to 13. Finally, we find the remainder of 13 when divided by 1000, which is simply 13.
