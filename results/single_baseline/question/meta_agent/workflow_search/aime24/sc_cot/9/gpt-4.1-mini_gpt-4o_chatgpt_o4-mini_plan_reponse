        "problem": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \\( \\binom{10}{4} = 210 \\). Next, we calculate the number of ways to win a prize, which is the number of ways to have at least 2 of Jen's numbers match the drawn numbers. We consider the cases where exactly 2, 3, or all 4 of Jen's numbers are drawn. For exactly 2 matches, Jen chooses 2 numbers from the 4 drawn and 2 from the remaining 6, which gives \\( \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{6}{2} = 90 \\). For exactly 3 matches, Jen chooses 3 numbers from the 4 drawn and 1 from the remaining 6, which gives \\( \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{6}{1} = 24 \\). For exactly 4 matches, Jen chooses all 4 numbers drawn, which gives \\( \\binom{4}{4} = 1 \\). Adding these, the total number of ways to win a prize is \\( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \\). The probability of winning the grand prize given a prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize (1 way) divided by the number of ways to win a prize (115 ways), which is \\( \\frac{1}{115} \\). Thus, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 115 \\), so \\( m+n = 116 \\).\n\nAnswer:116",
