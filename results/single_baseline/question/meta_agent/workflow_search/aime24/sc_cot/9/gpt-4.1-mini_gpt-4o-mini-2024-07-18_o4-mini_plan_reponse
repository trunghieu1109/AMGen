        "problem": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, we first need to calculate the total number of ways she can pick her numbers and the ways the lottery can pick the numbers. Then, we will determine the conditions for winning a prize and winning the grand prize. We will use conditional probability to find the required probability.\n\nAnswer:92",
