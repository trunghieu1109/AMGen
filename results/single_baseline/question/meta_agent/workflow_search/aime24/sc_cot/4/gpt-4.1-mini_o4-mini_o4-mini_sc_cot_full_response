Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9UD3', content='We seek the smallest prime p for which n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution. Testing p=2,3,5,7,11,13 all fail. For p=17 one finds solutions mod17, and by Hensel lifting these give solutions mod17^2. Lifting n₀≡2,8,9,15 mod17 yields residues mod289 of m≡155,110,179,134. The smallest positive is 110. Hence p=17 and the least m is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
