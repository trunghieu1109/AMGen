        "response": "To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by examining the expression n^4 + 1 modulo p^2. We will check small prime numbers to find the least prime p satisfying this condition. For each prime p, we will look for integer values of n such that n^4 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod p^2). After finding such a prime, we will determine the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.\n\nAnswer:5",
