Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by examining the expression n^4 + 1 modulo p^2. We will check small prime numbers to find the least prime p satisfying this condition. For each prime p, we will look for integer values of n such that n^4 + 1 â‰¡ 0 (mod p^2). After finding such a prime, we will determine the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
