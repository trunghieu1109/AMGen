proposed answer: We are tasked with finding the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). This means \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). We start by considering small prime numbers and check for which \( p \) this congruence can hold. 

For \( p = 2 \), \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) implies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), which is impossible since \( n^4 \equiv 0 \text{ or } 1 \pmod{4} \). 

Next, consider \( p = 3 \). We need \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \), i.e., \( n^4 \equiv -1 \equiv 8 \pmod{9} \). Checking powers of \( n \) modulo 9, we find \( n^4 \equiv 0, 1, 4, 7 \pmod{9} \), none of which are \( 8 \). So \( p = 3 \) does not work. 

For \( p = 5 \), we need \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \), i.e., \( n^4 \equiv -1 \equiv 24 \pmod{25} \). We test values for \( n \) modulo 5 where \( n^4 \equiv 24 \pmod{25} \). 

Checking small values, we find that for \( n = 3 \), \( n^4 = 81 \equiv 6 \pmod{25} \) and for \( n = 7 \), \( n^4 = 2401 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \). 

Continuing this process, we find that for \( n = 11 \), \( n^4 = 14641 \equiv 24 \pmod{25} \). Thus, \( n = 11 \) works for \( p = 5 \). 

Therefore, the least prime \( p \) is 5, and the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \) is 11.
