        "response": "We seek the smallest prime p for which n^4+1\u22610 mod p^2 has a solution. Testing p=2,3,5,7,11,13 all fail. For p=17 one finds solutions mod17, and by Hensel lifting these give solutions mod17^2. Lifting n\u2080\u22612,8,9,15 mod17 yields residues mod289 of m\u2261155,110,179,134. The smallest positive is 110. Hence p=17 and the least m is 110.\n\nAnswer:110",
