        "response": "We seek the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. For a box with edges x,y,z>0, the constraints are xy+yz+zx=27 and xyz=23, and the space\u2010diagonal squared is D^2=x^2+y^2+z^2. The sphere radius must be at least half the maximum diagonal, so r^2=(1/4)\u00b7max\u2009D^2.\n\nLet S=x+y+z, P=xyz=23, and \u03a3=xy+yz+zx=27. Then D^2=S^2\u22122\u03a3=S^2\u221254, so maximizing D^2\u21d4maximizing S. By symmetry and Lagrange multipliers, the extremum occurs when two edges are equal, say x=y=a and z=b. From constraints a^2b=23 and a^2+2ab=27, we get a^3\u221227a+46=0, whose positive roots are a=2 and a=\u22121+2\u221a6\u22483.89898. These give sums S=2a+b\u22489.75 and \u22489.31; the larger is 9.75 at a=2, b=23/4=5.75. Then D^2_max=S^2\u221254=(9.75)^2\u221254=95.0625\u221254=41.0625=657/16. Thus r^2=(1/4)\u00b7(657/16)=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nAnswer:721",
