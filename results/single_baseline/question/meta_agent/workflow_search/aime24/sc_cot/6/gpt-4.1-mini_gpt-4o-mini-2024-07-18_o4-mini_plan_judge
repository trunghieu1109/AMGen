Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be denoted as x, y, and z. The conditions given are the surface area and volume of the box. The surface area is given by the equation 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54, leading to xy + xz + yz = 27. The volume is given by xyz = 23. To find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain the box, we need to calculate the radius in terms of the dimensions of the box. The radius r of the sphere that can contain the box is given by r = âˆš((x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / 2). We will find x^2 + y^2 + z^2 using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz). We can express (x + y + z)^2 in terms of the volume and surface area. We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers or inequalities to find the minimum value of r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / 2, and finally, we will simplify the fraction to find p and q.

Answer:p + q = 59
Extracted answer: p + q = 59
Correct answer: 721
