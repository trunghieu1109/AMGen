proposed answer: To solve the problem, we are given a set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express the square of this radius in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Finally, we will find \( p+q \). 

First, let's denote the dimensions of the box as \( x, y, z \). We have the equations: 
1. Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \)
2. Volume: \( xyz = 23 \)

From the surface area equation, we have \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \).

To find the smallest sphere that can contain the box, we need the diagonal of the box, since the sphere's diameter must be at least the diagonal of the box. The diagonal \( d \) of the box is given by \( d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \).

We will use the identity: 
\[ (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \]

Substituting \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \), we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 54 \]

We also know \( x, y, z \) are the roots of the cubic equation:
\[ t^3 - (x+y+z)t^2 + (xy+yz+zx)t - xyz = 0 \]

Therefore, \( x+y+z = s \), \( xy+yz+zx = 27 \), and \( xyz = 23 \).

We need to minimize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54 \).

By the AM-GM inequality, \( \frac{x+y+z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} = \sqrt[3]{23} \), so \( x+y+z \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23} \).

To minimize the diagonal, we should try to make the dimensions as close as possible. Solving for the dimensions that satisfy both equations is complex, but we can use symmetry and the AM-GM bound to find a reasonable estimate. 

Let us assume the dimensions are \( x = y = a \) and \( z = b \). Then:
\( 2a^2 + 2ab = 27 \) and \( a^2 b = 23 \).

Solving these, we find \( a \approx 2.53 \) and \( b \approx 3.57 \).

The diagonal is then \( \sqrt{2a^2 + b^2} \approx \sqrt{2(2.53)^2 + (3.57)^2} \approx \sqrt{16.33} \approx 4.04 \).

The sphere's radius is half of this diagonal, so \( r = \frac{4.04}{2} \approx 2.02 \). Thus, \( r^2 \approx 4.08 \).

To find the exact value, we solve for \( r^2 \) using the equations directly.

If \( x = \frac{3}{2}, y = 3, z = \frac{23}{9} \), we find:
\( x + y + z = \frac{3}{2} + 3 + \frac{23}{9} = \frac{77}{18} \)

Then, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \left(\frac{77}{18}\right)^2 - 54 = \frac{5929}{324} - 54 = \frac{5929}{324} - \frac{17496}{324} = \frac{-11567}{324} \).

We made a mistake in calculations.

Correctly, \( x = \frac{3}{2}, y = 3, z = \frac{23}{9} \) gives \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{9}{4} + 9 + \frac{529}{81} = \frac{81}{324} + \frac{324}{324} + \frac{529}{324} = \frac{934}{324} \).

Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{934}{324} = \frac{467}{162} \).

Therefore, \( p = 467 \) and \( q = 162 \).

Finally, \( p + q = 467 + 162 = 629 \).
