Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need number of finite nonempty subsets B with max(B) in A equals 2024. For each k in A, the number of such subsets is 2^(k-1) (choose any subset of {1,…,k−1} and include k). So we require ∑_{k∈A}2^{k−1}=2024. Writing 2024 in binary: 2024 = 1024+512+256+128+64+32+8 = 2^{10}+2^{9}+2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{5}+2^{3}. Thus A={e+1: 2^e appears}={4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. Sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.
