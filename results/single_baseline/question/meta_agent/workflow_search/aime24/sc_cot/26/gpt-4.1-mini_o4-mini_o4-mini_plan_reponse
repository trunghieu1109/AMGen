        "response": "We need number of finite nonempty subsets B with max(B) in A equals 2024. For each k in A, the number of such subsets is 2^(k-1) (choose any subset of {1,\u2026,k\u22121} and include k). So we require \u2211_{k\u2208A}2^{k\u22121}=2024. Writing 2024 in binary: 2024 = 1024+512+256+128+64+32+8 = 2^{10}+2^{9}+2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{5}+2^{3}. Thus A={e+1: 2^e appears}={4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. Sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.\n\nAnswer:55",
