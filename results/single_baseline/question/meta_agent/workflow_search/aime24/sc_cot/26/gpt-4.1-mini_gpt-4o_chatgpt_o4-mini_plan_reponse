        "response": "Let A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\} be the set chosen by Alice. For each a_i in A, Bob can form sets B where the maximum element is a_i. The number of such sets B is 2^{a_i - 1}, since we can choose any subset of \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_i - 1\\} and include a_i to form a set B. Therefore, the total number of sets B is \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{a_i - 1}. We are given that this sum is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of A. \n\nFirst, express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2: 2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^3. This corresponds to a potential set A = \\{11, 10, 4\\}. The sum of the elements of A is 11 + 10 + 4 = 25.\n\nAnswer:25",
