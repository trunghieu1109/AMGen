Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let the set A contain k elements, and let these elements be a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k. For each a_i in A, we can form sets B that include a_i as the maximum element. To form a set B with maximum element a_i, we can choose any subset of the elements of A that are less than a_i. The number of such subsets is 2^(i-1) (the power set of the elements before a_i). Therefore, the total number of sets B that can be formed is the sum of the subsets for each maximum element in A, which is 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1) = 2^k - 1. We want this total to equal 2024. Hence, we set 2^k - 1 = 2024, which gives us 2^k = 2025. We find k such that 2^k = 2025. The closest power of two is 2^11 = 2048, so k = 11. The elements of A must be the first 11 positive integers {1, 2, ..., 11}. The sum of these elements is 1 + 2 + ... + 11 = 66.
