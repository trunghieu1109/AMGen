    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We model each placement by assigning each row i a color R_i∈{W,B} and each column j a color C_j∈{W,B}, then placing a chip in cell (i,j) iff R_i=C_j.  Uniformity and maximality exactly correspond to this rule, provided no color appears among rows without also appearing among columns and vice versa.  If k rows are W then we must pick k columns to be W (else some W‐row would be empty or vice versa), and the other rows/columns are B.  There are C(5,k) ways to choose W‐rows and C(5,k) ways to choose W‐columns, for k=0,…,5.  Summing gives ∑_{k=0}^5 C(5,k)^2=C(10,5)=252.
