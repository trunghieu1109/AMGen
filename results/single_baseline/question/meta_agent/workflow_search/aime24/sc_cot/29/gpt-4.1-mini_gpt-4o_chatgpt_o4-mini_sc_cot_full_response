Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent g8rp', content='To solve this problem, we need to consider how we can place chips on a 5x5 grid such that all chips in the same row and the same column have the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. For each row, we can choose to place either all white chips or all black chips. Similarly, for each column, we can choose to place either all white chips or all black chips. However, the conditions mean that we cannot have a row of one color and a column of the other color intersecting with a chip placed, as this would violate the uniformity condition. The solution is to place either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 rows with chips of one color and the remaining rows with chips of the other color. For each configuration of rows, the columns must match the color pattern of the rows. Therefore, if we choose k rows to be one color, the same k columns must be the same color, and the remaining 5-k rows and columns must be the other color. The number of ways to choose k rows out of 5 is \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\), and the number of ways to choose k columns out of 5 is also \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\). However, the choice of columns is determined by the choice of rows to maintain the condition. Thus, the number of configurations is determined by choosing k rows of one color, and the columns are automatically determined. We sum over all possible k.\n\nAnswer:6', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
