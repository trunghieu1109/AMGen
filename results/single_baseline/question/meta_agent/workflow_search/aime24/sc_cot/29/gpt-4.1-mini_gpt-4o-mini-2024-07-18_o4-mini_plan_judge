Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We need to distribute chips in a $5 \times 5$ grid while adhering to the conditions that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and column are of the same color, and we cannot add any more chips without violating these rules. This means that for each row and column, we can either have all white chips, all black chips, or no chips at all. The decision for each row can be made independently of the others, and similarly for each column. We need to account for the configurations that can be formed with both colors while ensuring that no additional chip can be added without breaking the conditions.

Answer:The number of ways to place the chips is 252.
Extracted answer: The number of ways to place the chips is 252.
Correct answer: 902
