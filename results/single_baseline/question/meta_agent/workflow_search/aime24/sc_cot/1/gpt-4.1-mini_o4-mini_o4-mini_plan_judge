Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), find A=(1/3,4√14/3). Compute circumcenter O via perpendicular bisectors: O=(4.5,33√14/56). Compute tangent lines at B and C, find their intersection D=(4.5,−378/(11√14)). Parametrize line AD: A+t(D−A). The second intersection P occurs at parameter t_P satisfying (A+t_Pv−O)·v=0 twice, giving t_P=792/1521. Compute |v|=|D−A|=325/22, so AP=|t_P|·|v|=(792/1521)*(325/22)=11700/1521=100/13. Thus m+n=100+13=113.
