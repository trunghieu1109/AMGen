    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we use the concept of the power of a point and some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so BD = DC. The power of point D with respect to the circle is given by DA * DP = DB^2. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, we have DB = DC. This implies that D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC, making DA = DP. The triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle, and we have the lengths of AB, BC, and AC. We can use these lengths to find the value of AP using the power of a point and properties of secants and tangents.

First, we find the semi-perimeter of the triangle ABC: s = (5 + 9 + 10) / 2 = 12.

Then, we can use Heron&#39;s formula to find the area of triangle ABC: A = sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - AC)) = sqrt(12 * 7 * 3 * 2) = sqrt(504) = 6 * sqrt(14).

The circumradius R of triangle ABC is given by R = (abc) / (4A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. Here, a = 5, b = 9, c = 10, so R = (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6 * sqrt(14)) = 15 / sqrt(14).

Using the power of point D, DA * DP = DB^2. Since DA = DP, we have DA^2 = DB^2, so DA = DB.

The power of a point can also be given by DA * DP = (DB + DC) * DB. Since DB = DC, we have DA * DP = 2DB^2.

Using the fact that DA = DP, we have DA^2 = 2DB^2, so DA = sqrt(2) * DB.

Now, using the fact that DA * DP = 2DB^2, we have (sqrt(2) * DB)^2 = 2DB^2, so DB = 0.

This means that DA = DP = sqrt(2) * DB.

Finally, since AP is a chord of the circle, we can use the power of a point to find its length: AP = 2R * sin(A), where A is the angle opposite side BC.

Using the sine rule, sin(A) = a / (2R) = 5 / (2 * 15 / sqrt(14)) = sqrt(14) / 6.

So, AP = 2 * (15 / sqrt(14)) * (sqrt(14) / 6) = 5.

Thus, AP = 5, which can be written as 5/1, so m = 5 and n = 1.

Therefore, m + n = 5 + 1 = 6.
