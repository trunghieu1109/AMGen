Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To find AP, we can use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that if a point D lies outside a circle, then the power of point D with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points where a secant line intersects the circle. In this case, we will find the lengths of the tangents from D to points B and C, and then use these to find AP. We will first find the lengths of the tangents from D to B and C using the formula for the power of a point, and then we will apply the theorem to find AP.

Answer:AP = \frac{15}{4} = \frac{15}{4} \Rightarrow m+n = 15+4 = 19.
Extracted answer: AP = \frac{15}{4} = \frac{15}{4} \Rightarrow m+n = 15+4 = 19.
Correct answer: 113
