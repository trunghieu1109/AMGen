Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To find the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of moves to the right (R) and moves up (U), totaling 16 moves (8 R and 8 U). Changing direction exactly four times means that the path will consist of four segments, where each segment can either be horizontal or vertical. Given that we need to end up at the upper right corner (8, 8), we can think of the path as a sequence of segments that comprise both right and up moves. The segments can be represented as a sequence of moves: RRRRUUUU, UUUURRRR, etc. Each change in direction indicates a switch between R and U. To ensure we have exactly four changes, we can denote the segments as follows: R1 U1 R2 U2 R3 U3 R4 U4. We must allocate the total moves to these segments while ensuring that the total number of R's and U's is 8 each. We can use combinatorial counting to find the number of ways to distribute the segments, ensuring we respect the constraints of the grid. We can apply the stars and bars theorem or combinatorial counting methods to achieve this. After counting the valid distributions and applying the necessary combinatorial coefficients, we arrive at the final count.
