        "response": "We need the number of R/U sequences of length 16 with 8 R\u2019s and 8 U\u2019s that have exactly 4 direction changes. A sequence with 4 changes has 5 runs, alternating R and U. Case 1: start with R, so runs 1,3,5 are R\u2019s summing to 8 (compositions into 3 positive parts: C(7,2)=21) and runs 2,4 are U\u2019s summing to 8 (compositions into 2 positive parts: C(7,1)=7), for 21\u00b77=147 sequences. Case 2: start with U gives the same count 147. Total = 147+147 = 294.\n\nAnswer:294",
