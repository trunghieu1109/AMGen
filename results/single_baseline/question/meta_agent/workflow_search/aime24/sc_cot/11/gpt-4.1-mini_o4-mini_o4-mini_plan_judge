Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We need the number of R/U sequences of length 16 with 8 R’s and 8 U’s that have exactly 4 direction changes. A sequence with 4 changes has 5 runs, alternating R and U. Case 1: start with R, so runs 1,3,5 are R’s summing to 8 (compositions into 3 positive parts: C(7,2)=21) and runs 2,4 are U’s summing to 8 (compositions into 2 positive parts: C(7,1)=7), for 21·7=147 sequences. Case 2: start with U gives the same count 147. Total = 147+147 = 294.
