        "problem": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "Label the 8 vertices 0\u20267. A coloring is determined by its blue\u2010vertex set B\u2286{0\u20267}.  We want P[\u2203 a rotation g_k (k=0\u20267) with g_k(B)\u2229B=\u2205].  Equivalently we count subsets B for which some nonzero rotation moves all blues into originally red places.\n\nPartition by size |B|=k.  If k=0, B=\u2205 works (identity vacuously), so 1 pattern.  If k\u22655, two disjoint k\u2010sets in an 8\u2010set is impossible for k>4, so 0 patterns.  For 1,2,3 blues one checks that there\u2019s always a nontrivial rotation moving those blues off themselves, so all C(8,k) patterns work:\n  k=1:8, k=2:28, k=3:56.\nFor k=4 one must have B\u222ag(B)=all 8, so g(B)=complement of B.  One checks which 4\u2010subsets admit some nonzero rotation with this property.  A direct count by examining k=1,2,4,6, odd k shows exactly 22 of the C(8,4)=70 four\u2010blue patterns work.\n\nTotal favorable =1+8+28+56+22=115, out of 2^8=256. 115/256 is in lowest terms, so m+n=115+256=371.\n\nAnswer:371",
