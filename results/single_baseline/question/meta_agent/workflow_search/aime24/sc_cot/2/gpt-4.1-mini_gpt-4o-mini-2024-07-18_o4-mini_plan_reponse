The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the blue vertices of a colored regular octagon can be rotated to occupy the positions of the red vertices. We can analyze the coloring of the vertices and the symmetries of the octagon. The total number of colorings is 2^8 since each vertex can be either red or blue. We need to count how many of these colorings allow for a rotation where all blue vertices land on red vertex positions. This condition can be satisfied if the number of blue vertices is either 0, 4, or 8. We will calculate the probabilities for each of these cases, considering the symmetries of the octagon, and then find the total probability. Finally, we will simplify the resulting fraction to find m and n, and compute m+n.\n\nAnswer:23",
