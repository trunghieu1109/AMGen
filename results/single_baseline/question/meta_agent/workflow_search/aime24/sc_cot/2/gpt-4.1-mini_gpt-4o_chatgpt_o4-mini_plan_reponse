        "problem": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the coloring of the octagon is such that it can be rotated to swap blue and red vertices. This is a symmetry problem involving the dihedral group of the octagon. \n\nFirst, consider the total number of ways to color the octagon. Each vertex can be red or blue, so there are a total of 2^8 = 256 colorings.\n\nThe octagon can be rotated by 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315 degrees. For the coloring to be symmetric under rotation, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, because each rotation must map blue to red and vice versa. Thus, there must be exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices.\n\nNext, we count the number of colorings that remain unchanged under each rotation:\n- For a 0-degree rotation, any coloring remains unchanged, so there are \\(\\binom{8}{4} = 70\\) such colorings.\n- For rotations of 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, the octagon can never map a coloring of 4 blue and 4 red onto itself, since these rotations map a vertex to a vertex that is not diametrically opposite.\n- For a 90-degree rotation, the octagon can be divided into 4 pairs of opposite vertices. Each pair must have one red and one blue. There are 2 choices (red or blue) for each of the 4 pairs, giving 2^4 = 16 colorings.\n- For a 180-degree rotation, the octagon can be divided into 4 pairs of opposite vertices, similar to the 90-degree rotation. Each pair must have one red and one blue, giving 2^4 = 16 colorings.\n- For a 270-degree rotation, similar to the 90-degree rotation, there are 16 colorings.\n\nBy Burnside's Lemma, the number of symmetric colorings is the average number of fixed colorings under these rotations:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8} (70 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 0) = \\frac{118}{8} = 14.75. \\]\n\nSince the number of colorings must be an integer, we realize there was an error in counting. Re-evaluating, we notice that the only valid rotations are 0 and 180 degrees, as the others don't preserve the balance of 4 blue and 4 red. \n\nRecounting, we have:\n- 70 colorings for 0 degrees.\n- 16 colorings for 180 degrees.\n\nThus, the correct number of symmetric colorings is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8} (70 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0) = \\frac{86}{8} = 10.75. \\]\n\nThis is still incorrect, indicating a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let's simplify:\n\nConsider the 180-degree rotation: each pair of opposite vertices must have one red and one blue, giving 2^4 = 16 colorings.\n\nThus, the probability that the coloring is symmetric is the number of symmetric colorings divided by the total number of colorings:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{256} = \\frac{1}{16}. \\]\n\nTherefore, m = 1 and n = 16, so m+n = 17.\n\nAnswer:17",
