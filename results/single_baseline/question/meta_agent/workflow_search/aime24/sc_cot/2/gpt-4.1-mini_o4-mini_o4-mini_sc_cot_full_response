Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kcwy', content='Label the 8 vertices 0…7. A coloring is determined by its blue‐vertex set B⊆{0…7}.  We want P[∃ a rotation g_k (k=0…7) with g_k(B)∩B=∅].  Equivalently we count subsets B for which some nonzero rotation moves all blues into originally red places.\n\nPartition by size |B|=k.  If k=0, B=∅ works (identity vacuously), so 1 pattern.  If k≥5, two disjoint k‐sets in an 8‐set is impossible for k>4, so 0 patterns.  For 1,2,3 blues one checks that there’s always a nontrivial rotation moving those blues off themselves, so all C(8,k) patterns work:\n  k=1:8, k=2:28, k=3:56.\nFor k=4 one must have B∪g(B)=all 8, so g(B)=complement of B.  One checks which 4‐subsets admit some nonzero rotation with this property.  A direct count by examining k=1,2,4,6, odd k shows exactly 22 of the C(8,4)=70 four‐blue patterns work.\n\nTotal favorable =1+8+28+56+22=115, out of 2^8=256. 115/256 is in lowest terms, so m+n=115+256=371.\n\nAnswer:371', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
