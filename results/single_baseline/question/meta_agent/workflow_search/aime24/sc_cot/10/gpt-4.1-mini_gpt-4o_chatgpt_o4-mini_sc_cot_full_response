Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent S4P3', content='We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with certain conditions. D, E, C, and F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, A, D, H, and G lie on a circle, which means ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. We are given the sides of the rectangles: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, the line segment CE is part of the line DECF. We can find the length of CE by considering the total length of DECF and subtracting the known segments. DE = AB = 107, and CF = FG = 17. Since DECF is a straight line, DE + EF + CF = DC + CE + EF + FG. We have DE = 107, EF = 184, and CF = 17. Therefore, CE = EF = 184, because DE + CF = DC, and we need to account for the full length of EF on the line DECF.\n\nAnswer:184', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
