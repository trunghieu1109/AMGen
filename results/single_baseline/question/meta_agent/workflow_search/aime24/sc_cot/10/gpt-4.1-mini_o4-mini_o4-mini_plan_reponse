        "response": "We place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, let E=(t,16), F=(t+184,16). Rectangle EFGH has FG\u22a5EF of length 17, so H=(t,33) and G=(t+184,33). Points A,D,H are on a circle x\u00b2+y\u00b2+ux+vy=0, and requiring G also lie on it yields the equation t\u00b2+184t\u2013561=0, whose solutions are t=3 or t=\u2013187. Only t=3 places E between D and C. Thus E=(3,16) and C=(107,16), giving CE=|107\u20133|=104.\n\nAnswer:104",
