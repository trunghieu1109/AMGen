        "response": "To find the length of CE, we need to analyze the positions of the rectangles and the relationships between their sides. Given the dimensions of rectangles ABCD and EFGH, we can deduce the positions of points E and C, as well as the distance CE based on the collinearity of the points D, E, C, and F. We will use the provided lengths to calculate CE step by step.\n\nAnswer:168",
