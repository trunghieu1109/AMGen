Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8Mhg', content='We place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, let E=(t,16), F=(t+184,16). Rectangle EFGH has FG⊥EF of length 17, so H=(t,33) and G=(t+184,33). Points A,D,H are on a circle x²+y²+ux+vy=0, and requiring G also lie on it yields the equation t²+184t–561=0, whose solutions are t=3 or t=–187. Only t=3 places E between D and C. Thus E=(3,16) and C=(107,16), giving CE=|107–3|=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
