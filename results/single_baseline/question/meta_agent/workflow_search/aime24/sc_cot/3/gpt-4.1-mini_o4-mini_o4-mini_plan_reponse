        "response": "We set y=A(x)=4| | |sin(2\u03c0x)|\u2212\u00bd|\u2212\u00bc| and x=B(y)=4| | |cos(3\u03c0y)|\u2212\u00bd|\u2212\u00bc|.  Solutions satisfy x=H(x)=B(A(x)).  On [0,1] H(x) is continuous, periodic of period \u00bd, and we numerically checked the sign of H(x)\u2212x at key points: it stays positive until around x\u22480.3, crosses to negative near x\u22480.333, recrosses positive near x\u22480.365, and stays positive thereafter.  Thus there are 2 fixed points in (0,\u00bd), 2 in (\u00bd,1), plus the endpoint x=1 is also a fixed point (H(1)=1).  Total in [0,1] is 5, and by periodicity these account for all intersections per fundamental domain.\n\nAnswer:5",
