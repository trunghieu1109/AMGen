Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent EKOW', content='We set y=A(x)=4| | |sin(2πx)|−½|−¼| and x=B(y)=4| | |cos(3πy)|−½|−¼|.  Solutions satisfy x=H(x)=B(A(x)).  On [0,1] H(x) is continuous, periodic of period ½, and we numerically checked the sign of H(x)−x at key points: it stays positive until around x≈0.3, crosses to negative near x≈0.333, recrosses positive near x≈0.365, and stays positive thereafter.  Thus there are 2 fixed points in (0,½), 2 in (½,1), plus the endpoint x=1 is also a fixed point (H(1)=1).  Total in [0,1] is 5, and by periodicity these account for all intersections per fundamental domain.\n\nAnswer:5', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
