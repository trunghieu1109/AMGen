        "response": "To find the number of intersections of the graphs, we need to analyze the functions f(x) and g(x) and how they transform the input values from sine and cosine functions. First, we note that f(x) and g(x) are both defined in terms of absolute values, which will create piecewise functions. We will analyze the ranges of f and g, apply them to sine and cosine, and then solve the resulting equations to find the intersections.\n\nAnswer:8",
