Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To find the number of intersections, we need to analyze the functions and their compositions. First, consider the function $f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|$. This function takes the absolute value of $x$, subtracts $\frac{1}{2}$, takes the absolute value again, and is non-negative and piecewise linear. Similarly, $g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}|$ is also non-negative and piecewise linear. Next, we analyze $4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ and $4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$. The functions $\sin(2\pi x)$ and $\cos(3\pi y)$ are periodic with periods 1 and $\frac{2}{3}$, respectively. We need to find intersections of $y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ and $x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$. We will consider the intervals where $\sin(2\pi x)$ and $\cos(3\pi y)$ vary between $-1$ and $1$ and examine the behavior of $f$ and $g$ to find their compositions. The intersections occur where both expressions are equal, i.e., $4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = x$ and $4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = y$. By symmetry and periodicity, we can solve for one period and count solutions.
