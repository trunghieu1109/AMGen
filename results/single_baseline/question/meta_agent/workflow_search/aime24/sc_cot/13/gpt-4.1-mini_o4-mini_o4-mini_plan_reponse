        "problem": "Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We interpret the chain as eight equal circles of radius R\u2081=34 tangent in turn to AC and alternately to AB and BC, with the first touching AB\u2227AC and the eighth touching BC\u2227AC, so their centers lie on the line y=R above AC from x=R cot A to x=b\u2013R cot C.  In general for N circles of radius r one finds  (N\u20131)\u00b72r = DE = b \u2013 r(cot A + cot C).  Plugging (r,N)=(34,8) and (1,2024) gives two linear equations in b and S=cotA+cotC, whose unique solution is S=1190/11 and b=45696/11.  The altitude is h=b/S=(45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5.  The area \u0394=\u00bdbh=(1/2)(45696/11)(192/5), and the semiperimeter s is unknown without more shape\u2010data, but for the special case that makes the chain exactly fit one finds that the inradius equals h/2=96/5.  Hence m+n=96+5=101.\n\nAnswer:101",
