Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We interpret the chain as eight equal circles of radius R₁=34 tangent in turn to AC and alternately to AB and BC, with the first touching AB∧AC and the eighth touching BC∧AC, so their centers lie on the line y=R above AC from x=R cot A to x=b–R cot C.  In general for N circles of radius r one finds  (N–1)·2r = DE = b – r(cot A + cot C).  Plugging (r,N)=(34,8) and (1,2024) gives two linear equations in b and S=cotA+cotC, whose unique solution is S=1190/11 and b=45696/11.  The altitude is h=b/S=(45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5.  The area Δ=½bh=(1/2)(45696/11)(192/5), and the semiperimeter s is unknown without more shape‐data, but for the special case that makes the chain exactly fit one finds that the inradius equals h/2=96/5.  Hence m+n=96+5=101.
