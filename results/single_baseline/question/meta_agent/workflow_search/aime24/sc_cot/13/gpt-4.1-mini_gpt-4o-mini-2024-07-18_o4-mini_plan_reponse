The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To solve for the inradius of triangle ABC, we first analyze the arrangement of the circles. The eight larger circles of radius 34 are tangent to each other and to the sides AB and BC of triangle ABC. We need to find the relationship between the radius of the circles and the inradius of the triangle. Additionally, we know that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged similarly, which gives us a scaling factor to relate the two cases. We will derive the inradius based on the geometry of the arrangement.\n\nAnswer:2025",
