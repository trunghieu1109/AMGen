Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We are given a triangle with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. We need to find the product AB * AC. We can use the relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the sides of the triangle. The formula relating the circumradius R, inradius r, and the sides a, b, c of the triangle is given by: R = abc / (4 * K) and r = K / s, where K is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. Additionally, we know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which suggests a specific configuration of the triangle. We can find the area K using r and s, and then use R to find a, b, c, and ultimately AB * AC.

Answer:AB * AC = 156.
Extracted answer: AB * AC = 156.
Correct answer: 468
