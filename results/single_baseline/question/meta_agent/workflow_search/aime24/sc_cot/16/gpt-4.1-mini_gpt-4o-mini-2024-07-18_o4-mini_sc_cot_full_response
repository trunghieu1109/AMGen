Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MiT3', content='We are given a triangle with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. We need to find the product AB * AC. We can use the relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the sides of the triangle. The formula relating the circumradius R, inradius r, and the sides a, b, c of the triangle is given by: R = abc / (4 * K) and r = K / s, where K is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. Additionally, we know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which suggests a specific configuration of the triangle. We can find the area K using r and s, and then use R to find a, b, c, and ultimately AB * AC.\n\nAnswer:AB * AC = 156.', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
