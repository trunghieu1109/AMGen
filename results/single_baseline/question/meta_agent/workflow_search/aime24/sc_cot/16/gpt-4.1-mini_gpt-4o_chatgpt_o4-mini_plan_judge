Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). The circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We also know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, let's recall some properties of triangles and their centers. The relation \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the ex-touch point of the A-excircle with the circumcircle. This is a special configuration and suggests the use of known results.

One such result involves the relation between \( R \), \( r \), and the product \( AB \cdot AC \) when \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Specifically, this configuration implies that:
\[ AB \cdot AC = c^2 = (R^2 - 2Rr)^2. \]

Let's compute this value:
\[ R^2 = 13^2 = 169. \]
\[ 2Rr = 2 \times 13 \times 6 = 156. \]
\[ R^2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13. \]

Thus, \( c^2 = (R^2 - 2Rr)^2 = 13^2 = 169. \)

Therefore, \( AB \cdot AC = 169. \)
