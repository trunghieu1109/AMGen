Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent PGFE', content='To find the unique point C on the line segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family F, we first need to determine the equation of the line segment AB. The coordinates of points A and B are given as A=(1/2, 0) and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of the line AB can be calculated as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, the equation of the line AB can be derived. Next, we need to analyze the segments in the family F. Each segment PQ has endpoints on the x-axis and y-axis such that the length of the segment PQ is 1. The coordinates of P can be represented as (x, 0) and Q as (0, y), where x^2 + y^2 = 1. Given that C lies on AB, we can express the coordinates of C in terms of a parameter t, where C=(t/2, sqrt(3)(1-t)/2). We also need to ensure that the distance from O to C is not equal to 1, as segments in F have length 1. By setting up the equations and solving for t, we can find the coordinates of C. Finally, we calculate OC^2 and express it as p/q, where p and q are coprime integers, and find p + q.\n\nAnswer:5', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
