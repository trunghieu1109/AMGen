        "response": "We seek the unique point C on the segment AB (with A=(1/2,0), B=(0,\u221a3/2)) such that the equation x/p + y/q = 1 (which characterizes points on a unit\u2010length segment from (p,0) to (0,q)) has a double root at (p,q)=(1/2,\u221a3/2).  Equivalently, the curve F2(p,q)=x\u2009q+y\u2009p\u2212p\u2009q=0 is tangent to the circle p^2+q^2=1 at (1/2,\u221a3/2).  Computing the condition that their gradients are linearly dependent yields C=(1/8,3\u221a3/8).  Then OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3\u221a3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23",
