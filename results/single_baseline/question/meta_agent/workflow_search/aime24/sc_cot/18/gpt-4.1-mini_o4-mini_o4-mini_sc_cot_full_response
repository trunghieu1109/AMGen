Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent y0sl', content='We seek the unique point C on the segment AB (with A=(1/2,0), B=(0,√3/2)) such that the equation x/p + y/q = 1 (which characterizes points on a unit‐length segment from (p,0) to (0,q)) has a double root at (p,q)=(1/2,√3/2).  Equivalently, the curve F2(p,q)=x\u2009q+y\u2009p−p\u2009q=0 is tangent to the circle p^2+q^2=1 at (1/2,√3/2).  Computing the condition that their gradients are linearly dependent yields C=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
