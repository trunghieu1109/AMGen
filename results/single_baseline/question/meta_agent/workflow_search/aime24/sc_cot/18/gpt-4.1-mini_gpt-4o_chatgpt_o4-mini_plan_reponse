        "response": "Let's first understand the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of segments \\(\\overline{PQ}\\). A segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has unit length with \\(P = (x, 0)\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(Q = (0, y)\\) on the \\(y\\)-axis. The distance formula gives us \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1\\), so \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\). This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1, but since \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) must lie on the axes, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are non-negative. Hence, \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) describes an arc in the first quadrant from \\((1, 0)\\) to \\((0, 1)\\).\n\nNext, consider the line \\(\\overline{AB}\\). The coordinates of \\(A\\) are \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\). The line \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is described by the parametric equations \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}t\\) and \\(y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\) for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\).\n\nWe are looking for a point \\(C\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\), distinct from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), such that \\(C\\) does not belong to any segment from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). For a point \\(C = (x, y)\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\), where \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}t\\) and \\(y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\), we want \\(x^2 + y^2 \\neq 1\\) except for the endpoints.\n\nSubstituting \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}t\\) and \\(y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\) into \\(x^2 + y^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}t\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}t^2 + \\frac{3}{4}t^2 = t^2. \\]\n\nThus, \\(x^2 + y^2 = t^2\\). For \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), we must have \\(t^2 = 1\\), which implies \\(t = 1\\) or \\(t = -1\\). However, since \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\), only \\(t = 1\\) is valid, corresponding to the point \\(B\\).\n\nTherefore, for any point \\(C\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) other than \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(x^2 + y^2 \\neq 1\\). We need to find \\(C\\) such that it is distinct from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so \\(0 < t < 1\\).\n\nLet's choose a point \\(C\\) where \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\), which is between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Then:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}. \\]\n\nSo, \\(C = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)\\).\n\nNow, we calculate \\(OC^2\\):\n\n\\[ OC^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}. \\]\n\nThus, \\(OC^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\), where \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 4\\). Therefore, \\(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\\).\n\nAnswer:5",
