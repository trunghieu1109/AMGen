    <pre>Let&#39;s first understand the family \(\mathcal{F}\) of segments \(\overline{PQ}\). A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\) has unit length with \(P = (x, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q = (0, y)\) on the \(y\)-axis. The distance formula gives us \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1\), so \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1, but since \(P\) and \(Q\) must lie on the axes, \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative. Hence, \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) describes an arc in the first quadrant from \((1, 0)\) to \((0, 1)\).

Next, consider the line \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The line \(\overline{AB}\) is described by the parametric equations \(x = \frac{1}{2}t\) and \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\) for \(0 \leq t \leq 1\).

We are looking for a point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\), such that \(C\) does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). For a point \(C = (x, y)\) on \(\overline{AB}\), where \(x = \frac{1}{2}t\) and \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\), we want \(x^2 + y^2 \neq 1\) except for the endpoints.

Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{2}t\) and \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\) into \(x^2 + y^2\), we get:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}t\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}t^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = t^2. \]

Thus, \(x^2 + y^2 = t^2\). For \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), we must have \(t^2 = 1\), which implies \(t = 1\) or \(t = -1\). However, since \(0 \leq t \leq 1\), only \(t = 1\) is valid, corresponding to the point \(B\).

Therefore, for any point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) other than \(A\) and \(B\), \(x^2 + y^2 \neq 1\). We need to find \(C\) such that it is distinct from \(A\) and \(B\), so \(0 &lt; t &lt; 1\).

Let&#39;s choose a point \(C\) where \(t = \frac{1}{2}\), which is between \(A\) and \(B\). Then:

\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}. \]

So, \(C = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\).

Now, we calculate \(OC^2\):

\[ OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}. \]

Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), where \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\). Therefore, \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).
