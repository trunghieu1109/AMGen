Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rRLm', content='To find the distance from the point I to the faces of the tetrahedron ABCD, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its vertices and the distances from a point inside it to the faces. We can calculate the volume of tetrahedron ABCD using the given edge lengths and then find the distance from point I to the faces. The distance can be expressed in the required form, and we will compute m, n, and p accordingly.\n\nAnswer:62', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
