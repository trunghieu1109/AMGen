Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent I87Y', content='We have a disphenoid tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89. Such a tetrahedron is isosceles and has an insphere. The inradius is given by r=3V/S, where V is volume and S is total surface area.\n\n1. Compute the area of one face, say ΔABC with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.  \n   Use the formula A² = (1/16)[(a²+b²+c²)² − 2(a⁴+b⁴+c⁴)].  \n   Here a²=41, b²=80, c²=89 ⇒ a²+b²+c²=210, a⁴+b⁴+c⁴=1681+6400+7921=16002.  \n   ⇒ A²=(1/16)[210²−2·16002]=(1/16)[44100−32004]=12096/16=756 ⇒ A=6√21.  \n   All four faces are congruent, so S=4·6√21=24√21.\n\n2. Compute volume via the disphenoid formula.  \n   With a²=41, b²=80, c²=89, one finds  \n   4a²b²c²=4·41·80·89=1167680,  \n   −a²(b²+c²−a²)²=−41·128²=−671744,  \n   −b²(c²+a²−b²)²=−80·50²=−200000,  \n   −c²(a²+b²−c²)²=−89·32²=−91136,  \n   +(b²+c²−a²)(c²+a²−b²)(a²+b²−c²)=128·50·32=204800.  \n   Sum =409600, so V²=409600/144=25600/9 ⇒ V=160/3.\n\n3. Then r=3V/S=(3·(160/3))/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63.  \n\nThe inradius in lowest terms is (20√21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63, hence m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
