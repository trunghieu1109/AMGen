Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We seek rhombi centered at O with vertices Â=±A and B̂=±B on the hyperbola x^2/20–y^2/24=1. Such a parallelogram is a rhombus iff A·B=0. The diagonal BD connects B to D=–B, so BD^2=4|B|^2=4(x^2+y^2). For B on the hyperbola, y^2=24(x^2/20–1)=(6/5)x^2–24, so BD^2=4[(11/5)x^2–24]=(44/5)x^2–96. A corresponding A exists iff the line A·B=0 meets the hyperbola, which forces y^2/x^2>5/6 ⇒x^2>720/11. Thus the infimum of BD^2 occurs as x^2→720/11+, giving BD^2→(44/5)(720/11)–96=576–96=480. Hence BD^2>480 always, and 480 is the greatest lower bound.
