Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9VCL', content='To find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi, we start by noting the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus. The points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are on the hyperbola defined by $\x0crac{x^2}{20} - \x0crac{y^2}{24} = 1$. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, so let the coordinates of points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be represented as $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(-x_1, -y_1)$, and $(-x_2, -y_2)$ respectively. The diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$, and we can find the lengths of these diagonals. The length of diagonal $BD$ can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of points $B$ and $D$. We will calculate $BD^2 = (x_2 - (-x_2))^2 + (y_2 - (-y_2))^2 = (2x_2)^2 + (2y_2)^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)$.\n\nAnswer:96', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
