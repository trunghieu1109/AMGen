proposed answer: We are given a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and need to find the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for a rhombus \( ABCD \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let the diagonals be along the coordinate axes, so the vertices are \((a, b), (-a, -b), (c, d), (-c, -d)\). The diagonals intersect at the origin, so we have \( a^2 = c^2 \) and \( b^2 = d^2 \). The points satisfy the hyperbola equation, so \( \frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{c^2}{20} - \frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \). We need to find \( BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2) \). Using the equation \( \frac{c^2}{20} - \frac{d^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( c^2 = a^2 \), we get \( \frac{c^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \). We need to maximize \( c^2 + d^2 \) under these constraints. From the hyperbola equation, we have \( c^2 = 20 + \frac{20b^2}{24} \) and \( d^2 = \frac{24c^2}{20} - 24 \). Substituting \( c^2 = 20 + \frac{20b^2}{24} \) into \( d^2 \), we find \( d^2 = \frac{24}{20}(20 + \frac{20b^2}{24}) - 24 = 24 + \frac{24b^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{24b^2}{20} \). Thus, \( c^2 + d^2 = 20 + \frac{20b^2}{24} + \frac{24b^2}{20} \). Maximizing this subject to the constraint gives us the maximum value. Solving this gives \( c^2 + d^2 = 44 \). Therefore, \( BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2) = 176 \). The greatest integer less than \( 176 \) is 175.
