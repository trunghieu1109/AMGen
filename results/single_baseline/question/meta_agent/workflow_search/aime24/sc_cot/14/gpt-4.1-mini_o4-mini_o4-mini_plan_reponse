        "response": "We seek rhombi centered at O with vertices \u00c2=\u00b1A and B\u0302=\u00b1B on the hyperbola x^2/20\u2013y^2/24=1. Such a parallelogram is a rhombus iff A\u00b7B=0. The diagonal BD connects B to D=\u2013B, so BD^2=4|B|^2=4(x^2+y^2). For B on the hyperbola, y^2=24(x^2/20\u20131)=(6/5)x^2\u201324, so BD^2=4[(11/5)x^2\u201324]=(44/5)x^2\u201396. A corresponding A exists iff the line A\u00b7B=0 meets the hyperbola, which forces y^2/x^2>5/6 \u21d2x^2>720/11. Thus the infimum of BD^2 occurs as x^2\u2192720/11+, giving BD^2\u2192(44/5)(720/11)\u201396=576\u201396=480. Hence BD^2>480 always, and 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nAnswer:480",
