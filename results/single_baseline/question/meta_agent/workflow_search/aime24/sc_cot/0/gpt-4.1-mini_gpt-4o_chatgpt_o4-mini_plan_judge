Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Let's first determine Aya's walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. We know that when Aya walks at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. When she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. We can set up the equations based on these scenarios. 

First equation: 
For speed s, the time walking is (9/s) hours, and the total time is 4 hours, so the time in the coffee shop is t = 4*60 - 9/s*60. 

Second equation: 
For speed s + 2, the time walking is (9/(s+2)) hours, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, or 2.4 hours. The time in the coffee shop is t = 2.4*60 - 9/(s+2)*60.

Since t is the same in both cases, we equate the two expressions for t:
4*60 - 9/s*60 = 2.4*60 - 9/(s+2)*60.

Solving this equation gives us s = 3 km/h.

Now we know s = 3 km/h. When Aya walks at s + 1/2 = 3 + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, we calculate the time taken to walk 9 km as 9/3.5 hours.

9/3.5 = 2.57142857 hours, which is 2 hours and 34.2857143 minutes.

Including the coffee shop time t, which we can find from t = 4*60 - 9/3*60 = 60 minutes, the total time is 2 hours and 34.2857143 minutes + 60 minutes = 3 hours and 34.2857143 minutes.

Thus, the total time in minutes is 3*60 + 34.2857143 = 214.2857143 minutes.

Rounding to the nearest minute, the total time is 214 minutes.
