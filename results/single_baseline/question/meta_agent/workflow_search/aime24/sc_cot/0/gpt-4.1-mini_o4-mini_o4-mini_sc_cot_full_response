Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qJTD', content='Let walking time =9/v hours and coffee time T hours. Equations:\n9/s+T=4 and 9/(s+2)+T=2.4. Subtract:9/s−9/(s+2)=1.6 ⇒18/(s(s+2))=1.6 ⇒s(s+2)=11.25 ⇒s=2.5. Then T=4−9/2.5=0.4 h=24 min. At speed s+0.5=3 km/h walking time=9/3=3 h, total=3+0.4=3.4 h=204 min.\n\nAnswer:204', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
