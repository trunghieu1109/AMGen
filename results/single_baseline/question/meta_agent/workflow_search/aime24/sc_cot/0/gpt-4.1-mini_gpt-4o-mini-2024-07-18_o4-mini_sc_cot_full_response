Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5S0N', content="First, we need to set up equations based on the information given about Aya's walks at different speeds. We know the distance is 9 kilometers. We can express the time taken for the walk as distance divided by speed. For the first scenario, walking at speed s: time = 9/s hours. For the second scenario, walking at speed s+2: time = 9/(s+2) hours. Both times include t minutes spent in the coffee shop, which we need to account for. We convert t minutes into hours (t/60 hours) and set up the equations accordingly. Then, we solve for s and t using the two scenarios provided. Finally, we calculate the time taken when she walks at speed s + 0.5 and include the time spent in the coffee shop to find the total time in minutes.\n\nAnswer:150", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
