Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 22dn', content='We want nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=300 and sum_sym a^2b =6,000,000.  Note sum_sym a^2b =300(ab+bc+ca) -3abc =6,000,000, so 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc =2,000,000.  Fix c and set p =a+b =300–c, q =ab.  Then ab+bc+ca =q +c p, abc =c q, so equation becomes q(100–c) +100c p =2,000,000, or for c≠100,\n q =100(200–c).  Since a,b are roots of t^2 –p t +q=0, the discriminant is Δ =p^2–4q = (300–c)^2 –4·100(200–c) = (c–100)^2, a perfect square.  Thus a,b = (p±(c–100))/2 =100 and 200–c in either order, giving 2 solutions for each c∈[0,200], c≠100.  That yields 200·2=400 solutions.  For c=100 the equation holds identically, so any (a,b) with a+b=200 works, giving 201 solutions.  Total =400+201=601.\n\nAnswer:601', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
