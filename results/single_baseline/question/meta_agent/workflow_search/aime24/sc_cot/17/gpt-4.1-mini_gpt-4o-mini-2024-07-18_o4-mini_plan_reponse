        "response": "To solve for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying the equations, we first note that the first equation gives us a constraint on the total sum of a, b, and c. The second equation involves a quadratic form in terms of a, b, and c. We can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the others, and then substitute that into the second equation. This will lead to a polynomial equation in two variables. We can then analyze the solutions to this polynomial equation under the constraint that a + b + c = 300. We will systematically explore integer values for the variables and count valid solutions. After going through this process, we find that the total number of valid triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations is 600.\n\nAnswer:600",
