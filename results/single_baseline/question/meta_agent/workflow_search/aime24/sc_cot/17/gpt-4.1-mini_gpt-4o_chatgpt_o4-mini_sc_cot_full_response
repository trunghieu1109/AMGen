Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent maJt', content='To solve this problem, we are given two conditions involving nonnegative integers a, b, and c. First, we have the equation a + b + c = 300. Second, we have the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We can rewrite the second equation as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substituting these into the equation, we get a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000. This is a complex equation to solve directly, but we can try specific values for a, b, and c that satisfy a + b + c = 300 and see if they satisfy the second equation. A natural starting point is to check if a, b, and c can be equal or nearly equal, as this often simplifies symmetry problems.\n\nAnswer:100', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
