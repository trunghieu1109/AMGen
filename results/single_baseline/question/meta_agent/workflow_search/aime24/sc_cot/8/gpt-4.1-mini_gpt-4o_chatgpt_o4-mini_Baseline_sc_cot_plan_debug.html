    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine which positions (number of tokens) are losing positions for Alice, meaning that no matter what move Alice makes, Bob can always respond in a way that eventually forces Alice to lose. We start by identifying the base cases and then use them to find a pattern.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, Bob wins by default since Alice cannot make a move. Thus, n = 0 is a losing position for Alice.

Next, consider small values of n:
- n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n = 1 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 2: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes the last token and wins. So, n = 2 is a losing position for Alice.
- n = 3: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob. Bob can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Alice, who takes the last token and wins. So, n = 3 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 4: Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. So, n = 4 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 5: Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes the last token and wins. So, n = 5 is a losing position for Alice.

From these base cases, we observe a pattern: positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, etc., are losing positions for Alice. These positions are exactly those that are 2 more than a multiple of 3.

To find all such positions less than or equal to 2024, we solve the equation n = 3k + 2 for k.

The smallest n that satisfies this equation is 2 (k = 0), and the largest n is 2024. We need to find the largest k such that 3k + 2 &lt;= 2024.

Subtract 2 from both sides: 3k &lt;= 2022.
Divide by 3: k &lt;= 674.

Therefore, k ranges from 0 to 674, inclusive, giving us 675 values of n that are losing positions for Alice and thus winning for Bob.
