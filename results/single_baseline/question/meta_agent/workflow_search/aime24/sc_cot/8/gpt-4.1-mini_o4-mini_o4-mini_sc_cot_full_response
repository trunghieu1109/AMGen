Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MMll', content='We model the game as a subtraction game with moves {1,4}.  Positions where the first player loses (P–positions) satisfy that every move leads to an N–position.  Computing small cases shows the P–positions (including 0) are exactly n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,… with differences alternating 2,3, giving explicit formulas: positive P–positions are n≡0 mod\u20095 (n=5,10,15,…) and n≡2 mod\u20095 (n=2,7,12,…).  Alice moves first, so Bob can force a win exactly when n is a P–position.  We count positive n≤2024 with n mod\u20095 in {0,2}. There are ⌊2024/5⌋=404 multiples of 5, and for residue 2 there are ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405 numbers.  Total=404+405=809.\n\nAnswer:809', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
