        "problem": "Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",

        "response": "We model the game as a subtraction game with moves {1,4}.  Positions where the first player loses (P\u2013positions) satisfy that every move leads to an N\u2013position.  Computing small cases shows the P\u2013positions (including 0) are exactly n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,\u2026 with differences alternating 2,3, giving explicit formulas: positive P\u2013positions are n\u22610 mod\u20095 (n=5,10,15,\u2026) and n\u22612 mod\u20095 (n=2,7,12,\u2026).  Alice moves first, so Bob can force a win exactly when n is a P\u2013position.  We count positive n\u22642024 with n mod\u20095 in {0,2}. There are \u230a2024/5\u230b=404 multiples of 5, and for residue 2 there are \u230a(2024\u22122)/5\u230b+1=405 numbers.  Total=404+405=809.\n\nAnswer:809",
