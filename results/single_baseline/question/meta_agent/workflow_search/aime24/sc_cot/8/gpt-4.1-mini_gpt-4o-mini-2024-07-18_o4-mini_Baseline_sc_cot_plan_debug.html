    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To determine the values of n for which Bob has a winning strategy, we can analyze the game using winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win no matter what they do. Conversely, a winning position allows the player to force a win with optimal play. We start by defining the base cases: 1 token is a winning position for Alice, as she can take the last token and win. With 2 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, which is winning for him. With 3 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, which is winning for him. With 4 tokens, Alice can take all 4 and win. With 5 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob, which is winning for him. Continuing this analysis, we find that losing positions for Alice occur at 0, 5, 10, 15, etc., where n is a multiple of 5. Therefore, for Bob to guarantee a win, n must be a multiple of 5. We need to count the multiples of 5 that are less than or equal to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020. The multiples of 5 up to 2024 are: 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. This forms an arithmetic sequence where a = 5, d = 5, and we need to find the number of terms in this sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated as a_n = a + (n-1)d. Setting a_n = 2020 gives 2020 = 5 + (n-1)5. Solving for n gives n = 404. Thus, there are 404 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
