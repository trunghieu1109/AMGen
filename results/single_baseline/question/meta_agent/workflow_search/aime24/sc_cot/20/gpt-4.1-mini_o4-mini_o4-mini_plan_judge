Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We look for positive integers n with exactly two base-b digits x,y (so n=xb+y with 1≤x≤b−1, 0≤y≤b−1) and x+y=√n.  Write k=√n, so n=k² and k=x+y ⇒ y=k−x.  Then k² = xb +y = xb +k−x ⇒ k² −k = x(b−1) ⇒ x = k(k−1)/(b−1).  We need x integer in [1,b−1] and y=k−x integer in [0,b−1].  The divisibility condition is (b−1)∣k(k−1).  Since k(k−1)≡0 mod p^a forces k≡0 or1 mod p^a for each prime power dividing b−1, the number of residue‐classes k mod (b−1) giving divisibility is exactly 2^ω(b−1), where ω counts distinct prime factors.  Among these classes in 1≤k≤b−1, one is k≡1≡1 (giving x=0) to discard.  Hence the number of valid k (and so of b-eautiful n) is 2^ω(b−1)−1.  We want this to exceed 10, i.e. 2^ω(b−1)−1>10 ⇒2^ω(b−1)>11 ⇒ω(b−1)≥4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒b=211.  No smaller b−1 has 4 distinct primes, so the least b is 211.
