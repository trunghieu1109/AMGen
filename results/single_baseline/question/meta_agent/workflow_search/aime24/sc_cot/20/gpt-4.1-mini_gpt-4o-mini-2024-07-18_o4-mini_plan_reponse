Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "To find the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to determine the criteria for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it can be expressed in base b as a two-digit number, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. The two-digit representation in base b can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b, and must satisfy 0 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(n). We will iterate through integers b starting from 2 and count the number of valid n for each b until we find a b with more than 10 valid n.\n\nAnswer:11",
