Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BRk4', content='To find the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to determine the criteria for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it can be expressed in base b as a two-digit number, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. The two-digit representation in base b can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b, and must satisfy 0 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(n). We will iterate through integers b starting from 2 and count the number of valid n for each b until we find a b with more than 10 valid n.\n\nAnswer:11', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
