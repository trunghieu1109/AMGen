Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lQhU', content="To solve the problem, we need to find the base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, say \\(n = ab + c\\) where \\(0 \\leq a < b\\) and \\(0 \\leq c < b\\), and the sum of the digits \\(a + c = \\sqrt{n}\\). For n to be a perfect square, \\(a + c\\) must also be an integer. Thus, we need to find the number of pairs (a, c) such that \\(ab + c = (a + c)^2\\). We want more than 10 such pairs. Let's solve for b starting from b = 2. For each b, iterate over all possible values of a and c, compute n, and check if it satisfies the condition of being b-beautiful. We stop when we find a base b with more than 10 such integers.\n\nAnswer:6", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
