Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, say \(n = ab + c\) where \(0 \leq a < b\) and \(0 \leq c < b\), and the sum of the digits \(a + c = \sqrt{n}\). For n to be a perfect square, \(a + c\) must also be an integer. Thus, we need to find the number of pairs (a, c) such that \(ab + c = (a + c)^2\). We want more than 10 such pairs. Let's solve for b starting from b = 2. For each b, iterate over all possible values of a and c, compute n, and check if it satisfies the condition of being b-beautiful. We stop when we find a base b with more than 10 such integers.
