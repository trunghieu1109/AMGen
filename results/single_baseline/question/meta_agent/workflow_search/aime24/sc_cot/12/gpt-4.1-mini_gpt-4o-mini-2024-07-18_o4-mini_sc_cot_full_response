Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hbf6', content='Let z = re^{i\theta} where |z| = r = 4. We can express the given expression as (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Substituting z = 4e^{i\theta}, we can rewrite the expression and focus on maximizing the real part. The term (96 + 144i)/z can be rewritten using the modulus of z, which will lead to a simpler expression to analyze. We will find the real part of the expression in terms of theta and maximize it.\n\nAnswer:171', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
