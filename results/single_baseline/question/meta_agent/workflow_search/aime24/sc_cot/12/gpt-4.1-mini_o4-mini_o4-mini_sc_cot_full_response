Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZZsv', content='We want max Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] for |z|=4. Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then the expression’s real part is 4(75 cosθ – 117 sinθ) + (1/4)(96 cosθ + 144 sinθ) =324 cosθ – 432 sinθ. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is √(A²+B²) = √(324²+(-432)²) = √291600 = 540.\n\nAnswer:540', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
