Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We want max Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] for |z|=4. Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then the expression’s real part is 4(75 cosθ – 117 sinθ) + (1/4)(96 cosθ + 144 sinθ) =324 cosθ – 432 sinθ. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is √(A²+B²) = √(324²+(-432)²) = √291600 = 540.
