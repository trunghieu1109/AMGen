        "response": "Let z = re^{i\theta} where |z| = r = 4. We can express the given expression as (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Substituting z = 4e^{i\theta}, we can rewrite the expression and focus on maximizing the real part. The term (96 + 144i)/z can be rewritten using the modulus of z, which will lead to a simpler expression to analyze. We will find the real part of the expression in terms of theta and maximize it.\n\nAnswer:171",
