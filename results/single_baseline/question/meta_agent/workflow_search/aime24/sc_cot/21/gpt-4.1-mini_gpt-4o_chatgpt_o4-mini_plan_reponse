        "response": "To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon as points where the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon can intersect to form a rectangle. A rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides and certain diagonals can be parallel. We can choose two pairs of parallel lines from the set of sides and diagonals to form a rectangle. There are 12 sides in the dodecagon. The diagonals can be grouped by their slopes, and diagonals with the same slope are parallel. To form a rectangle, we need to select two parallel lines from one set (say, horizontal lines) and two from another set (say, vertical lines). The number of ways to select two parallel lines from a set of n parallel lines is given by the combination formula C(n, 2). We sum over all possible sets of parallel lines that can form rectangles. In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices by diagonals, forming 6 sets of parallel lines, including the sides. Therefore, we can form rectangles by choosing any pair of these lines. The total number of rectangles is calculated by considering all possible pairs of parallel lines.\n\nAnswer:495",
