Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon with vertices labeled as points, we need to consider how rectangles can be formed using the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. A rectangle requires two pairs of opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length. Given the symmetry and the properties of a regular dodecagon, we can identify pairs of vertices that can serve as corners for rectangles. We can select 2 vertices from the 12 vertices of the dodecagon to form one diagonal of the rectangle, and then the opposite diagonal will be determined by the selection of the first two vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 12 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of vertices and k is the number of vertices to choose. Here, n = 12 and k = 2. Therefore, the total number of rectangles formed is C(12, 2) divided by 2, since each rectangle is counted twice (once for each diagonal).
