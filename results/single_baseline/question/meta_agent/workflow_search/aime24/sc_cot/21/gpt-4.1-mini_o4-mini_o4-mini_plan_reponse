        "response": "We model each diagonal or side of the regular 12\u2010gon as one of 36 parallel\u2010direction classes (indexed by step k=1\u20266 and an offset i mod 6).  A rectangle arises by choosing two parallel lines in one direction class and two in a perpendicular direction class; each direction class has exactly two parallel lines, so there\u2019s exactly one way to choose two lines once the class is fixed.  Hence the total number of rectangles is the number of unordered perpendicular pairs of direction classes.  One checks by a simple congruence count that each of the 36 classes is perpendicular to exactly 3 others, giving 36\u00b73/2=54 unordered pairs.\n\nAnswer:54",
