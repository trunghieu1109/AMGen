Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: We model each diagonal or side of the regular 12‐gon as one of 36 parallel‐direction classes (indexed by step k=1…6 and an offset i mod 6).  A rectangle arises by choosing two parallel lines in one direction class and two in a perpendicular direction class; each direction class has exactly two parallel lines, so there’s exactly one way to choose two lines once the class is fixed.  Hence the total number of rectangles is the number of unordered perpendicular pairs of direction classes.  One checks by a simple congruence count that each of the 36 classes is perpendicular to exactly 3 others, giving 36·3/2=54 unordered pairs.
