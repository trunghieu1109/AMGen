        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We set the torus axis vertical (z\u2010axis) and sphere center at (0,0,h).  In the meridian (\u03c1,z)\u2010plane the torus cross\u2010section is (\u03c1\u22126)^2+z^2=9 and the sphere is \u03c1^2+(z\u2212h)^2=121.  Enforcing tangency via Lagrange multipliers gives two solutions:\n\n\u2022 \u201cInner\u2010tube contact\u201d \u0394=\u03c1\u22126<0 \u21d2 h^2=160 \u21d2 \u03c1=6\u22129/7=33/7\n\u2022 \u201cOuter\u2010tube contact\u201d \u0394>0 \u21d2 h^2=28 \u21d2 \u03c1=6+9/4=33/4\n\nThus the two contact\u2010circle radii are 33/7 and 33/4.  Their difference is |33/7\u221233/4|=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127",
