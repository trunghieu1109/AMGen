        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle. We need to find the radii of these circles of tangency when the torus is placed in two different positions: once with the inner side (r_i) and once with the outer side (r_o) of the torus touching the sphere. For the inner tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The center of the torus is located at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution, so the radius of tangency is 14 - 6 = 8. For the outer tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of tangency is 8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, r_i = 8 and r_o = 2. The difference r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6. Thus, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnswer:7",
