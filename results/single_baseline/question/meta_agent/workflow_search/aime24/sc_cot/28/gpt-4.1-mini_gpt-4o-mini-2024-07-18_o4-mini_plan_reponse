        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the radii of the circles of tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation. The torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6, and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. We will find the inner radius (r_i) and outer radius (r_o) of the circles of tangency based on the geometry of the torus and sphere. The outer radius (r_o) corresponds to the case where the torus is resting on the sphere, while the inner radius (r_i) corresponds to the case where the torus is floating above the sphere. After calculating these radii, we will find the difference r_i - r_o and express it in the form m/n, then find m+n.\n\nAnswer:14",
