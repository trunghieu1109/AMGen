Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We set the torus axis vertical (z‐axis) and sphere center at (0,0,h).  In the meridian (ρ,z)‐plane the torus cross‐section is (ρ−6)^2+z^2=9 and the sphere is ρ^2+(z−h)^2=121.  Enforcing tangency via Lagrange multipliers gives two solutions:

• “Inner‐tube contact” Δ=ρ−6<0 ⇒ h^2=160 ⇒ ρ=6−9/7=33/7
• “Outer‐tube contact” Δ>0 ⇒ h^2=28 ⇒ ρ=6+9/4=33/4

Thus the two contact‐circle radii are 33/7 and 33/4.  Their difference is |33/7−33/4|=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.
