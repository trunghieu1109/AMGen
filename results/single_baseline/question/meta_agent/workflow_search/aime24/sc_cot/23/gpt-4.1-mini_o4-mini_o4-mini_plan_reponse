The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",

        "response": "We label the top row digits x1,x2,x3 and bottom row y1,y2,y3. The row\u2010sum condition gives 100(x1+y1)+10(x2+y2)+(x3+y3)=999, forcing xj+yj=9 for j=1,2,3. The column\u2010sum condition gives 10(x1+x2+x3)+(y1+y2+y3)=99, which together with xj+yj=9 implies x1+x2+x3=8 and yj=9\u2212xj automatically sums to 19. Thus we need nonnegative x1,x2,x3\u22649 summing to 8. The number of such solutions is C(8+3\u22121,3\u22121)=C(10,2)=45.\n\nAnswer:45",
