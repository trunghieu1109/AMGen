Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zAB0', content='We label the top row digits x1,x2,x3 and bottom row y1,y2,y3. The row‐sum condition gives 100(x1+y1)+10(x2+y2)+(x3+y3)=999, forcing xj+yj=9 for j=1,2,3. The column‐sum condition gives 10(x1+x2+x3)+(y1+y2+y3)=99, which together with xj+yj=9 implies x1+x2+x3=8 and yj=9−xj automatically sums to 19. Thus we need nonnegative x1,x2,x3≤9 summing to 8. The number of such solutions is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.\n\nAnswer:45', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
