Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading each row from left to right equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading each column from top to bottom equals 99. Let's denote the grid as follows, with each cell containing a digit:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \]

The conditions are:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(a + d = 9\)
3. \(b + e = 9\)
4. \(c + f = 9\)

From the first condition, we have the equation for the sum of the two numbers:
\[ (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 \]

Since the sums of each column must be 9, we have:
- \(a + d = 9\)
- \(b + e = 9\)
- \(c + f = 9\)

Substituting the column sums into the equation, we see:
\[ 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 100 \times 9 + 10 \times 9 + 9 = 999 \]

This confirms the conditions are consistent. Now, we need to count the number of solutions to these equations, where each variable \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) is a digit from 0 to 9.

For each pair (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f), we need to find the number of ways to choose two digits that sum to 9. The possible pairs (x, y) such that x + y = 9 and both x and y are digits are: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0). There are 10 such pairs for each column sum.

Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is the product of the number of ways to choose each pair:
\[ 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000 \]

Answer:1000
Extracted answer: 1000
Correct answer: 045
