Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We need to find a 2x3 grid where the sum of the two horizontal numbers equals 999 and the sum of the three vertical numbers equals 99. Let's denote the grid as follows:

```
| a1 | a2 | a3 |
| b1 | b2 | b3 |
```

The numbers formed by reading left to right are:
- Top row: `100a1 + 10a2 + a3`
- Bottom row: `100b1 + 10b2 + b3`

We need:
1. `100a1 + 10a2 + a3 + 100b1 + 10b2 + b3 = 999`
2. `a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + a3 + b3 = 99`

From the first equation, we can derive that:
- `100(a1 + b1) + 10(a2 + b2) + (a3 + b3) = 999`

From the second equation, we can derive that:
- `a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + a3 + b3 = 99`

We can express `b1`, `b2`, and `b3` in terms of `a1`, `a2`, and `a3` and find valid combinations of digits (0-9) that satisfy both conditions. Each digit must be a valid single digit in the range from 0 to 9. We can systematically check combinations to find valid grids.

Answer:The total number of valid configurations for the grid is 10.
Extracted answer: The total number of valid configurations for the grid is 10.
Correct answer: 045
