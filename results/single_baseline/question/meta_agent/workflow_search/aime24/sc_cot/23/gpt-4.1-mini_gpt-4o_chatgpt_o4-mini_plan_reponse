Let's denote the grid as follows, with each cell containing a digit:\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline a & b & c \\\\ \\hline d & e & f \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\]\n\nThe conditions are:\n1. \\(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\\)\n2. \\(a + d = 9\\)\n3. \\(b + e = 9\\)\n4. \\(c + f = 9\\)\n\nFrom the first condition, we have the equation for the sum of the two numbers:\n\\[ (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 \\]\n\nSince the sums of each column must be 9, we have:\n- \\(a + d = 9\\)\n- \\(b + e = 9\\)\n- \\(c + f = 9\\)\n\nSubstituting the column sums into the equation, we see:\n\\[ 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 100 \\times 9 + 10 \\times 9 + 9 = 999 \\]\n\nThis confirms the conditions are consistent. Now, we need to count the number of solutions to these equations, where each variable \\(a, b, c, d, e, f\\) is a digit from 0 to 9.\n\nFor each pair (a, d), (b, e), and (c, f), we need to find the number of ways to choose two digits that sum to 9. The possible pairs (x, y) such that x + y = 9 and both x and y are digits are: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0). There are 10 such pairs for each column sum.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is the product of the number of ways to choose each pair:\n\\[ 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000 \\]\n\nAnswer:1000",
