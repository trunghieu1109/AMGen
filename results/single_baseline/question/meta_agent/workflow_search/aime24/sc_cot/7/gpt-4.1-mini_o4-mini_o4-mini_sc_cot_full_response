Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1A4H', content='We have log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ x·log_x(y)=10 ⇒ log_x(y)=10/x ⇒ y=x^(10/x). Also log_y(x^(4y))=10 ⇒4y·log_y(x)=10 ⇒ log_y(x)=5/(2y) ⇒ x=y^(5/(2y)). Let a=ln x, b=ln y. Then from the two equations we get b·e^a=10a and 2a·e^b=5b. Multiplying gives e^(a+b)=25 ⇒a+b=ln25 ⇒xy=e^a·e^b=e^(a+b)=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
