proposed answer: We have two equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Let's start with the first equation: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This means \( y^x = x^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have \( x \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(x) \). This simplifies to \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \). 

For the second equation: \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), which means \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have \( 4y \log_{10}(x) = 10 \log_{10}(y) \). This simplifies to \( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \).

Now, let's solve these two equations: \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \) and \( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \). Substitute \( \log_{10}(y) \) from the first equation into the second equation: \( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \cdot \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \). 

This simplifies to \( 4y = x \). Thus, \( x = 4y \). Substitute \( x = 4y \) back into \( y^x = x^{10} \): \( y^{4y} = (4y)^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have \( 4y \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(4y) \). 

This gives \( 4y \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(4) + 10 \log_{10}(y) \). Rearranging gives \( 4y \log_{10}(y) - 10 \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(4) \). Factor out \( \log_{10}(y) \): \( (4y - 10) \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(4) \). 

Thus, \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10 \log_{10}(4)}{4y - 10} \). Since \( x = 4y \), we substitute \( x = 4y \) into \( xy \) to find \( xy = 4y^2 \). 

Now, let's solve for \( y \). Substitute \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10 \log_{10}(4)}{4y - 10} \) back into \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \): \( \frac{10 \log_{10}(4)}{4y - 10} = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(4y) \). 

This simplifies to \( \log_{10}(4) = \frac{4y - 10}{4y} \log_{10}(4y) \). Simplifying further, we find \( 4y = 20 \), so \( y = 5 \) and \( x = 20 \). Thus, \( xy = 20 \times 5 = 100 \).
