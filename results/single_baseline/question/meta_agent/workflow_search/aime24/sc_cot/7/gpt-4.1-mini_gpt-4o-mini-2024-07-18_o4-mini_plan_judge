proposed answer: We start with the equations given in the problem: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We can use the properties of logarithms to rewrite these equations. The first equation can be rewritten using the property \( \log_a(b^c) = c \log_a(b) \): \( x \log_x(y) = 10 \), which simplifies to \( \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \). Similarly, the second equation gives us \( 4y \log_y(x) = 10 \), leading to \( \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y} \). We now have two equations: \( \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \) and \( \log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y} \). Next, we can use the change of base formula to express these logarithms in terms of natural logarithms or common logarithms. We will express them in terms of natural logarithms: \( \log_x(y) = \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} \) and \( \log_y(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)} \). Setting these equal gives us two equations: \( \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x} \) and \( \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)} = \frac{5}{2y} \). We can cross-multiply to get two new equations: \( \ln(y) = \frac{10}{x} \ln(x) \) and \( \ln(x) = \frac{5}{2y} \ln(y) \). Substituting the expression for \( \ln(y) \) from the first equation into the second gives us a single equation in terms of \( x \) and \( y \). After some algebraic manipulation, we will find a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) that allows us to solve for their product \( xy \). Finally, we will substitute back to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) and calculate \( xy \).
