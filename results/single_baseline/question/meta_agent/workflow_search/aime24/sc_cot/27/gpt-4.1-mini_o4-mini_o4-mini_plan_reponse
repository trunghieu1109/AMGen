        "response": "We require a 4\u2010digit N=d3d2d1d0 such that replacing any single digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.  Writing N_i=N+(1\u2212d_i)10^i, we need N_i\u22610 mod7 for i=0..3, so N\u2261(d_i\u22121)10^i (mod7) for all i.  Equating these forces (d_i\u22121)10^i\u2261K (mod7) with a common K, and also N\u2261K.  Checking consistency shows K\u22613 mod7.  Solving (d_i\u22121)10^i\u22613 gives uniquely d3=5, d2=6, d0=4 and d1\u22612 mod7 \u21d2 d1=2 or 9.  The two candidates are 5624 and 5694, of which 5694 is larger.  Finally 5694\u00f71000 gives Q=5, R=694, and Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699",
