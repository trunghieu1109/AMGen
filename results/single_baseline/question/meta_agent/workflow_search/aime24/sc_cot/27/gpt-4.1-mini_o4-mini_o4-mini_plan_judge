Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We require a 4‐digit N=d3d2d1d0 such that replacing any single digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.  Writing N_i=N+(1−d_i)10^i, we need N_i≡0 mod7 for i=0..3, so N≡(d_i−1)10^i (mod7) for all i.  Equating these forces (d_i−1)10^i≡K (mod7) with a common K, and also N≡K.  Checking consistency shows K≡3 mod7.  Solving (d_i−1)10^i≡3 gives uniquely d3=5, d2=6, d0=4 and d1≡2 mod7 ⇒ d1=2 or 9.  The two candidates are 5624 and 5694, of which 5694 is larger.  Finally 5694÷1000 gives Q=5, R=694, and Q+R=699.
