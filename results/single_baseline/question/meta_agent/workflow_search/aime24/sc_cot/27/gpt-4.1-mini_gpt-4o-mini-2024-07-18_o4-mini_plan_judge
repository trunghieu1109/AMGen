Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to find the largest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote N as abcd, where a, b, c, d are the digits. We will check the divisibility condition for each digit being changed to 1.
