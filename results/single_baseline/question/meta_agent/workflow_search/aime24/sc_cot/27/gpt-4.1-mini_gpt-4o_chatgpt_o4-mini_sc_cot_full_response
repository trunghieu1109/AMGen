Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TtMA', content='To find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start by considering N = 9999 and check divisibility by 7 for each digit change. We need to ensure that changing any of the digits (thousands, hundreds, tens, or units) to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We systematically test each digit change and check divisibility by 7. We find that N = 8991 satisfies the condition. Then, we compute Q and R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, we find Q + R.\n\nAnswer:17', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
