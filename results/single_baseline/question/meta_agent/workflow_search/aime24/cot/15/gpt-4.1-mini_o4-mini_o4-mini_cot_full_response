Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dHBt', content='Let Ai be the set of owners of item i: A1 (ring)=195, A2 (clubs)=367, A3 (spade)=562, A4 (candy)=900. Every resident has candy hearts, so |A4|=900, and the union size is 900. Let xk be the number of residents who own exactly k items. Given x2=437, x3=234, and x4=N4 (unknown). Since x1+x2+x3+x4=900, x1=900−437−234−N4=229−N4. On the other hand, summing set sizes gives ∑|Ai|=195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals ∑ residents (number of items they own)=1·x1+2·437+3·234+4·N4. That is x1+874+702+4N4=2024 ⇒ x1+4N4=448 ⇒ x1=448−4N4. Equate the two expressions for x1: 229−N4=448−4N4 ⇒ 3N4=219 ⇒ N4=73.\n\nAnswer:73', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
