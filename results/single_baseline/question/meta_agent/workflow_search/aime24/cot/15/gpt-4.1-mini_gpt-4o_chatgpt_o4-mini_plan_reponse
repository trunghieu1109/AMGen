        "response": "We are given that there are 900 residents in Aimeville, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. We have the following numbers: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Additionally, 437 own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, including the bag of candy hearts. Let's denote the number of people who own all four items as x. The principle of inclusion-exclusion can be used here. The total number of people who own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) is 900, since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. The formula for inclusion-exclusion is: Total = (Number owning at least one item) = (Sum of those owning each item) - (Sum of those owning exactly two items) + (Sum of those owning exactly three items) - (Those owning all four items). Plugging in the numbers: 900 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 437 + 234 - x. Simplifying: 900 = 1124 - 437 + 234 - x. 900 = 921 - x. Solving for x gives x = 921 - 900 = 21.\n\nAnswer:21",
