Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent JfUS', content='To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know the total number of residents (900), the number of residents who own each item, the number who own exactly two items, and the number who own exactly three items.
