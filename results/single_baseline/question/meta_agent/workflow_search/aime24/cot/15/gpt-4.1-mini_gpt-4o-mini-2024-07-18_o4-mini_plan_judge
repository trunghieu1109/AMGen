Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know the total number of residents (900), the number of residents who own each item, the number who own exactly two items, and the number who own exactly three items. We can denote the number of residents who own all four items as x. We can set up the equation based on the information provided and solve for x.
