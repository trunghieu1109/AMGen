In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "Let Ai be the set of owners of item i: A1 (ring)=195, A2 (clubs)=367, A3 (spade)=562, A4 (candy)=900. Every resident has candy hearts, so |A4|=900, and the union size is 900. Let xk be the number of residents who own exactly k items. Given x2=437, x3=234, and x4=N4 (unknown). Since x1+x2+x3+x4=900, x1=900\u2212437\u2212234\u2212N4=229\u2212N4. On the other hand, summing set sizes gives \u2211|Ai|=195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals \u2211 residents (number of items they own)=1\u00b7x1+2\u00b7437+3\u00b7234+4\u00b7N4. That is x1+874+702+4N4=2024 \u21d2 x1+4N4=448 \u21d2 x1=448\u22124N4. Equate the two expressions for x1: 229\u2212N4=448\u22124N4 \u21d2 3N4=219 \u21d2 N4=73.\n\nAnswer:73",
