Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZIjk', content='We start with the given equations and convert them from logarithmic form to exponential form. Each equation can be rewritten to express the ratios of x, y, and z in terms of powers of 2. We will then manipulate these equations to find the values of x, y, and z, and ultimately compute the value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)|.\n\nAnswer:The value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| is 23/12, so m+n = 23 + 12 = 35.', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
