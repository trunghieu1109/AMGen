Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pq3G', content='We start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form. The first equation is \\( \\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which implies \\( \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2} \\). Similarly, the second equation \\( \\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\) implies \\( \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\), and the third equation \\( \\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\) implies \\( \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\). We can express these equations as: \\( x = yz\\sqrt{2} \\), \\( y = xz2^{1/3} \\), and \\( z = xy2^{1/4} \\). We need to find \\( \\left|\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\\right| \\). First, express \\( x^4y^3z^2 \\) in terms of powers of 2. From the equations, we have \\( x = yz\\sqrt{2} \\), \\( y = xz2^{1/3} \\), and \\( z = xy2^{1/4} \\). Substitute these into \\( x^4y^3z^2 \\) and simplify. After simplification, we find that \\( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{1/2} \\). Therefore, \\( \\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The absolute value is \\( \\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\). Thus, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\), so \\( m+n = 3 \\).\n\nAnswer:3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
