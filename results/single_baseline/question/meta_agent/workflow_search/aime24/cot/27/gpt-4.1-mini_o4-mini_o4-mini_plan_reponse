        "response": "We seek the largest 4-digit N=abcd such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a number divisible by 7.  Denote N_i the result when digit i is set to 1, and write the conditions N_i\u22610 mod 7 for i=1..4.  In terms of a,b,c,d the 4 congruences modulo 7 reduce to:\n(1) 2b+3c+d\u22611\n(2) 6a+3c+d\u22615\n(3) 6a+2b+d\u22614\n(4) 6a+2b+3c\u22616\nWe systematically let a run from 9 down, solve (2a\u2212c\u22611 mod 7) for c, (3a\u2212b\u22612) for b, then (1) for d, and check all of (1)\u2013(4).  No solutions for a=9,8,7,6.  For a=5 one finds two candidates 5624 and 5694; the larger is N=5694.  Checking: changing any digit to 1 gives 1694,5194,5614,5691, each divisible by 7.  Thus Q=N//1000=5 and R=N%1000=694, so Q+R=5+694=699.\n\nAnswer:699",
