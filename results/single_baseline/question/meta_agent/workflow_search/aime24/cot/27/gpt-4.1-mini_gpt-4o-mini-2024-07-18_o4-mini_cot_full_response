Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ei9e', content='To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we will denote N as abcd, where a, b, c, and d are its digits. We will check the conditions for divisibility by 7 for each digit change. The largest four-digit number is 9999, so we will start from there and work downwards until we find a suitable N.\n\nAnswer:1999', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
