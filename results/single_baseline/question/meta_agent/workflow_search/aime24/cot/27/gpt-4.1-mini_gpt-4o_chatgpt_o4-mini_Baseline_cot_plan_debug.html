    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start by considering the number N = 9999, the largest four-digit number, and check if changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We will systematically check each digit position.

1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1999. Check divisibility by 7: 1999 / 7 = 285.5714 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9199. Check divisibility by 7: 9199 / 7 = 1314.1428 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9991. Check divisibility by 7: 9991 / 7 = 1427.2857 (not divisible).

Since changing the tens digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we have a candidate for N. We need to check if there is a larger number that satisfies the condition.

Let&#39;s try N = 9989:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1989. Check divisibility by 7: 1989 / 7 = 284.1428 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9189. Check divisibility by 7: 9189 / 7 = 1312.7142 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9981. Check divisibility by 7: 9981 / 7 = 1425.8571 (not divisible).

Since 9989 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9979:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1979. Check divisibility by 7: 1979 / 7 = 282.7142 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9179. Check divisibility by 7: 9179 / 7 = 1311.2857 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9971. Check divisibility by 7: 9971 / 7 = 1424.4285 (not divisible).

Since 9979 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9969:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1969. Check divisibility by 7: 1969 / 7 = 281.2857 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9169. Check divisibility by 7: 9169 / 7 = 1309.8571 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9961. Check divisibility by 7: 9961 / 7 = 1422.8571 (not divisible).

Since 9969 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9959:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1959. Check divisibility by 7: 1959 / 7 = 279.8571 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9159. Check divisibility by 7: 9159 / 7 = 1308.4285 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9951. Check divisibility by 7: 9951 / 7 = 1421.2857 (not divisible).

Since 9959 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9949:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1949. Check divisibility by 7: 1949 / 7 = 278.4285 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9149. Check divisibility by 7: 9149 / 7 = 1306.9999 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9941. Check divisibility by 7: 9941 / 7 = 1419.8571 (not divisible).

Since 9949 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9939:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1939. Check divisibility by 7: 1939 / 7 = 276.9999 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9139. Check divisibility by 7: 9139 / 7 = 1305.5714 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9931. Check divisibility by 7: 9931 / 7 = 1418.4285 (not divisible).

Since 9939 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9929:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1929. Check divisibility by 7: 1929 / 7 = 275.5714 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9129. Check divisibility by 7: 9129 / 7 = 1304.1428 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9921. Check divisibility by 7: 9921 / 7 = 1417.2857 (not divisible).

Since 9929 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9919:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1919. Check divisibility by 7: 1919 / 7 = 274.1428 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9119. Check divisibility by 7: 9119 / 7 = 1302.7142 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9911. Check divisibility by 7: 9911 / 7 = 1415.8571 (not divisible).

Since 9919 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9909:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1909. Check divisibility by 7: 1909 / 7 = 272.7142 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9109. Check divisibility by 7: 9109 / 7 = 1301.2857 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9901. Check divisibility by 7: 9901 / 7 = 1414.4285 (not divisible).

Since 9909 also satisfies the condition, we continue to check larger numbers.

Let&#39;s try N = 9899:
1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1899. Check divisibility by 7: 1899 / 7 = 271.2857 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9099. Check divisibility by 7: 9099 / 7 = 1299.8571 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9819. Check divisibility by 7: 9819 / 7 = 1402.7142 (not divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9891. Check divisibility by 7: 9891 / 7 = 1412.9999 (not divisible).

Since 9899 does not satisfy the condition, we conclude that 9909 is the largest number that satisfies the condition.

Now, we find Q and R when 9909 is divided by 1000:
Q = 9909 // 1000 = 9
R = 9909 % 1000 = 909
Q + R = 9 + 909 = 918.
