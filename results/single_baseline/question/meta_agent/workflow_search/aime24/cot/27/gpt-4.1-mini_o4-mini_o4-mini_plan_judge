Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We seek the largest 4-digit N=abcd such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a number divisible by 7.  Denote N_i the result when digit i is set to 1, and write the conditions N_i≡0 mod 7 for i=1..4.  In terms of a,b,c,d the 4 congruences modulo 7 reduce to:
(1) 2b+3c+d≡1
(2) 6a+3c+d≡5
(3) 6a+2b+d≡4
(4) 6a+2b+3c≡6
We systematically let a run from 9 down, solve (2a−c≡1 mod 7) for c, (3a−b≡2) for b, then (1) for d, and check all of (1)–(4).  No solutions for a=9,8,7,6.  For a=5 one finds two candidates 5624 and 5694; the larger is N=5694.  Checking: changing any digit to 1 gives 1694,5194,5614,5691, each divisible by 7.  Thus Q=N//1000=5 and R=N%1000=694, so Q+R=5+694=699.
