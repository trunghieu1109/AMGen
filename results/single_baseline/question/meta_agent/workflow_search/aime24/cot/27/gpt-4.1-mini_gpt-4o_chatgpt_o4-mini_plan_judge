Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start by considering the number N = 9999, the largest four-digit number, and check if changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We will systematically check each digit position.

1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1999. Check divisibility by 7: 1999 / 7 = 285.5714 (not divisible).
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9199. Check divisibility by 7: 9199 / 7 = 1314.1428 (not divisible).
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check divisibility by 7: 9919 / 7 = 1417 (divisible).
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9991. Check divisibility by 7: 9991 / 7 = 1427.2857 (not divisible).

Since changing the tens digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we have a candidate for N. We need to check if there is a larger number that satisfies the condition.

Now, we find Q and R when 9909 is divided by 1000:
Q = 9909 // 1000 = 9
R = 9909 % 1000 = 909
Q + R = 9 + 909 = 918.
