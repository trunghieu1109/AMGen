Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we will denote N as abcd, where a, b, c, and d are its digits. We will check the conditions for divisibility by 7 for each digit change. The largest four-digit number is 9999, so we will start from there and work downwards until we find a suitable N.

Answer:1999
Extracted answer: 1999
Correct answer: 699
