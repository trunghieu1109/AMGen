Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent HZx2', content="To find the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola, we start by noting the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which means the vertices A, B, C, and D can be expressed in terms of the hyperbola's parametric equations. The hyperbola can be parametrized as x = a cosh(t), y = b sinh(t) where a = sqrt(20) and b = sqrt(24). The diagonals of the rhombus can be expressed in terms of these parameters, and we can derive the lengths of the diagonals. The length BD can be expressed in terms of the parameters, and we can find the maximum value of BD^2 by analyzing the resulting expressions. After performing the necessary calculations, we find that the maximum value of BD^2 approaches a certain limit as the parameters vary. We conclude that the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 48.\n\nAnswer:48", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
