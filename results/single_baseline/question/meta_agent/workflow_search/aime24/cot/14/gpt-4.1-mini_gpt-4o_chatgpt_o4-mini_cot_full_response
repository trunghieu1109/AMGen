Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent KNAe', content='The given hyperbola is centered at the origin with the equation \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let the diagonals be along the axes, with one diagonal along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. The vertices of the rhombus will be at points \\((a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, b), (0, -b)\\). These points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. For the points \\((a, 0)\\) and \\((-a, 0)\\), we have \\(\\frac{a^2}{20} = 1\\), giving \\(a^2 = 20\\). For the points \\((0, b)\\) and \\((0, -b)\\), we have \\(-\\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\\), giving \\(b^2 = -24\\), which is not possible. Therefore, the diagonals cannot be aligned with the axes. Instead, consider the diagonals as \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) such that \\(x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2\\) and \\(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0\\). The maximum value of \\(BD^2\\) occurs when the diagonals are aligned with the asymptotes of the hyperbola, which are \\(y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{20}} x\\). The length of the diagonal along the asymptote is maximized when the points are on the hyperbola. The equation of the asymptote is \\(y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{20}} x = \\pm \\sqrt{1.2} x\\). Substituting \\(y = \\sqrt{1.2} x\\) into the hyperbola equation gives \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{(\\sqrt{1.2} x)^2}{24} = 1\\). Simplifying, \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{1.2 x^2}{24} = 1\\) leads to \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{x^2}{20} = 1\\), which is not possible. Therefore, consider the maximum \\(BD^2\\) when the diagonals are along the axes. The maximum \\(BD^2\\) is \\(20 + 24 = 44\\).\n\nAnswer:43', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
