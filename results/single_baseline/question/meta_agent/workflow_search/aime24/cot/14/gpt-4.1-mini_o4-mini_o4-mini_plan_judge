Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We place the four vertices antipodally on the hyperbola so that B=(x₁,y₁), D=−B, A=(x₂,y₂), C=−A.  Rhombus means AB⊥BC gives x₁x₂+y₁y₂=0.  Parametrize A perpendicular to B by A=t(−y₁,x₁), and impose A on the hyperbola: t²(v²/20−u²/24)=1 where B=(u,v).  A is real exactly when v²/20−u²/24>0, i.e. u²>720/11.  Then BD²=4(u²+v²).  On the boundary u²=720/11 one finds v²=600/11 so u²+v²=120 and BD²→480.  For any genuine rhombus BD²>480, so 480 is the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.
