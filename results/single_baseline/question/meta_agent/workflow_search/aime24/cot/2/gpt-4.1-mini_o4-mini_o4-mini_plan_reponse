        "problem": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "We need the probability that a random red\u2013blue coloring of the 8 vertices admits a nontrivial rotation that sends all blue vertices onto originally red ones.  Equivalently, letting B be the set of blue vertices, we require some r\u22600 mod 8 with (B+r)\u2229B=\u2205.  One shows easily that any B of size 0,1,2,3 works, so that contributes C(8,0)+C(8,1)+C(8,2)+C(8,3)=1+8+28+56=93 colorings.  For |B|=4 one must exclude those 4\u2010subsets whose difference\u2010set \u0394=B\u2212B covers all nonzero residues mod 8; a direct count shows exactly 48 of the 70 four\u2010subsets are \u201cbad,\u201d leaving 22 \u201cgood.\u201d  Hence total good colorings 93+22=115, out of 2^8=256.  This fraction is 115/256 in lowest terms, so m+n=115+256=371.\n\nAnswer:371",
