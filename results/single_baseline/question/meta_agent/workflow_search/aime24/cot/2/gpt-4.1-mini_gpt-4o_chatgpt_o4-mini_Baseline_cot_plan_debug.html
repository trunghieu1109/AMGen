    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the regular octagon and how the coloring can be rotated. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees). We want the coloring to be such that there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. This means that the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, as each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. Therefore, we need to count the number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red vertices that are invariant under some rotation. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we calculate the number of such colorings by considering the fixed colorings under each rotation. For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \) colorings are fixed. For 90 and 270 degrees, no coloring is fixed because no 4-cycle can be split into two equal parts. For 180 degrees, we can have two pairs of opposite vertices being blue and the other two pairs being red, which gives \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) fixed colorings. For 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, no coloring is fixed because these rotations require all vertices to be the same color. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is \( \frac{1}{8}(70 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 0) = \frac{82}{8} = 10.25 \). However, this is incorrect because we need to consider the probability, not the number of colorings. The total number of colorings is \( 2^8 = 256 \). The probability is \( \frac{10}{256} = \frac{5}{128} \). Therefore, \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 128 \), so \( m+n = 133 \).
