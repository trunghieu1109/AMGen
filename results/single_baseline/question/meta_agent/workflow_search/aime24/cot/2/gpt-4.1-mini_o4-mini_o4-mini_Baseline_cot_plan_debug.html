    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need the probability that a random red–blue coloring of the 8 vertices admits a nontrivial rotation that sends all blue vertices onto originally red ones.  Equivalently, letting B be the set of blue vertices, we require some r≠0 mod 8 with (B+r)∩B=∅.  One shows easily that any B of size 0,1,2,3 works, so that contributes C(8,0)+C(8,1)+C(8,2)+C(8,3)=1+8+28+56=93 colorings.  For |B|=4 one must exclude those 4‐subsets whose difference‐set Δ=B−B covers all nonzero residues mod 8; a direct count shows exactly 48 of the 70 four‐subsets are “bad,” leaving 22 “good.”  Hence total good colorings 93+22=115, out of 2^8=256.  This fraction is 115/256 in lowest terms, so m+n=115+256=371.
