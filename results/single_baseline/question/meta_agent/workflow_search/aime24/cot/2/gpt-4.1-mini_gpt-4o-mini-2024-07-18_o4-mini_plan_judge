Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the coloring of the vertices of a regular octagon and the conditions under which the blue vertices can be rotated to match the positions of the red vertices. Each vertex can be colored red or blue with equal probability, leading to a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices occupy the positions of red vertices. This can happen if the number of blue vertices is even, as they must be able to pair with red vertices under rotation. We will count the valid configurations and calculate the probability accordingly.

Answer:m+n = 17
Extracted answer: m+n = 17
Correct answer: 371
