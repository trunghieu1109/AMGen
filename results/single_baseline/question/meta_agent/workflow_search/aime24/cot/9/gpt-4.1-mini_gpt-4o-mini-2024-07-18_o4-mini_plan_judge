Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. We will first determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, the number of ways she can win a prize, and the number of ways she can win the grand prize. Then we will use conditional probability to find the desired result.

Answer:The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \frac{1}{15}. Therefore, m+n = 1+15 = 16.
Extracted answer: The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \frac{1}{15}. Therefore, m+n = 1+15 = 16.
Correct answer: 116
