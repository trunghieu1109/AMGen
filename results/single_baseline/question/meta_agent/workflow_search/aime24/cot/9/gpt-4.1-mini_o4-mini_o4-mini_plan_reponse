The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "Total possible draws C(10,4)=210. Number of draws with exactly k matches to Jen\u2019s 4 numbers is C(4,k)*C(6,4\u2212k). For k=2: 6*15=90; k=3: 4*6=24; k=4:1. So draws with \u22652 matches=90+24+1=115. Only 1 draw gives all 4 matches. Thus P(grand\u2009|\u2009prize)=1/115, so m+n=1+115=116.\n\nAnswer:116",
