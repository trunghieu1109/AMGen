Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. 

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. This is given by the combination C(10, 4).

Next, calculate the number of ways to win a prize, which means at least 2 of Jen's numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. We can break this into cases:

1. Exactly 2 of Jen's numbers are chosen.
2. Exactly 3 of Jen's numbers are chosen.
3. All 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen (this is the grand prize case).

For each case, calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining numbers from the set S \ Jen's numbers.

Finally, calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won, which is the ratio of the number of ways to win the grand prize to the number of ways to win a prize.

Let's calculate:

1. Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10, 4) = 210.

2. Ways to win a prize:
   - Choose 2 of Jen's 4 numbers and 2 from the remaining 6: C(4, 2) * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90.
   - Choose 3 of Jen's 4 numbers and 1 from the remaining 6: C(4, 3) * C(6, 1) = 4 * 6 = 24.
   - Choose all 4 of Jen's numbers: C(4, 4) = 1.

   Total ways to win a prize = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

3. Ways to win the grand prize: 1 (since all 4 numbers must be Jen's numbers).

4. Probability of winning the grand prize given a prize is won: 1 / 115.

The probability is 1/115, so m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 116.
