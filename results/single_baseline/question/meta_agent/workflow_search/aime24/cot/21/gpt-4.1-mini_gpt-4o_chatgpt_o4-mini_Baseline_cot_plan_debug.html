    <pre>To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be used to form rectangles. We can label the vertices of the dodecagon as 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. For a regular polygon with 12 sides, the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite vertices is given by the formula for choosing 2 pairs of opposite sides from n sides, which is \( \binom{n/2}{2} \). For a dodecagon, n = 12, so we have \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \). Therefore, there are 15 rectangles that can be formed inside the dodecagon.
