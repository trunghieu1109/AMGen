Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We view each rectangle as determined by two pairs of parallel lines among the set L of all 66 lines through pairs of the 12 vertices (sides or diagonals). A rectangle arises by choosing two distinct lines of one orientation and two of a perpendicular orientation.  In a regular 12-gon, the 66 lines fall into 12 orientation‐classes (indexed m=0,…,11), where class m has C_m = 5 lines if m is even and C_m = 6 if m is odd.  Orientations m and m+6 (mod 12) are perpendicular.  Thus the total number of rectangles is

Sum_{m=0 to5} [C_m choose2]·[C_{m+6} choose2]
 = (5C2·5C2)+(6C2·6C2)+(5C2·5C2)+(6C2·6C2)+(5C2·5C2)+(6C2·6C2)
 = (10·10)+(15·15)+(10·10)+(15·15)+(10·10)+(15·15)
 =100+225+100+225+100+225=975
