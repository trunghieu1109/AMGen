Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent aBRc', content='To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be used to form rectangles. We can label the vertices of the dodecagon as 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. For a regular polygon with 12 sides, the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite vertices is given by the formula for choosing 2 pairs of opposite sides from n sides, which is \\( \\binom{n/2}{2} \\). For a dodecagon, n = 12, so we have \\( \\binom{6}{2} = 15 \\). Therefore, there are 15 rectangles that can be formed inside the dodecagon.\n\nAnswer:15', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
