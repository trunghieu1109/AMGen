Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Brx0', content='We view each rectangle as determined by two pairs of parallel lines among the set L of all 66 lines through pairs of the 12 vertices (sides or diagonals). A rectangle arises by choosing two distinct lines of one orientation and two of a perpendicular orientation.  In a regular 12-gon, the 66 lines fall into 12 orientation‐classes (indexed m=0,…,11), where class m has C_m = 5 lines if m is even and C_m = 6 if m is odd.  Orientations m and m+6 (mod 12) are perpendicular.  Thus the total number of rectangles is\n\nSum_{m=0 to5} [C_m choose2]·[C_{m+6} choose2]\n = (5C2·5C2)+(6C2·6C2)+(5C2·5C2)+(6C2·6C2)+(5C2·5C2)+(6C2·6C2)\n = (10·10)+(15·15)+(10·10)+(15·15)+(10·10)+(15·15)\n =100+225+100+225+100+225=975\n\nAnswer:975', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
