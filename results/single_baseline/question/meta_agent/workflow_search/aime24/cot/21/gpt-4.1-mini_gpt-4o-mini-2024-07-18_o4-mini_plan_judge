Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed using its vertices. A rectangle requires two pairs of opposite sides to be parallel and equal in length. In a regular dodecagon, we can use both the sides and the diagonals to form these rectangles. The vertices of the dodecagon can be labeled as V0, V1, ..., V11. A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices such that they are opposite each other. The key is to find pairs of vertices that can form the corners of a rectangle. We can systematically count the valid combinations of vertices that satisfy the rectangle condition.

Answer:The number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon is 30.
Extracted answer: The number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon is 30.
Correct answer: 315
