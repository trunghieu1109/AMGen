        "response": "To find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid, we need to analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of a sequence of moves right (R) and up (U) that ultimately leads from the bottom left corner (0,0) to the top right corner (8,8). A path that changes direction exactly four times will consist of segments of R's and U's, with each segment representing a straight line in one direction before changing to the other direction. Since the path must end at (8,8), we need to ensure that the total number of R's is 8 and the total number of U's is also 8. The four changes in direction imply that we will have five segments in total. We can denote the number of R's in each segment as r1, r2, r3, r4, and r5, and the number of U's as u1, u2, u3, u4, and u5. The conditions we need to satisfy are: r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 + r5 = 8 and u1 + u2 + u3 + u4 + u5 = 8. Each segment must have at least one R or U, which means r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 >= 1 and u1, u2, u3, u4, u5 >= 1. We can transform these variables by letting ri' = ri - 1 and ui' = ui - 1, which leads to the new equations: r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' = 3 and u1' + u2' + u3' + u4' + u5' = 3. The number of non-negative integer solutions to each of these equations can be found using the stars and bars combinatorial method. The number of solutions to r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' = 3 is given by C(3 + 5 - 1, 5 - 1) = C(7, 4) = 35. Similarly, the number of solutions to u1' + u2' + u3' + u4' + u5' = 3 is also 35. Since the choices for R's and U's are independent, the total number of paths is the product of the two counts: 35 * 35 = 1225. Therefore, the total number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times is 1225.\n\nAnswer:1225",
