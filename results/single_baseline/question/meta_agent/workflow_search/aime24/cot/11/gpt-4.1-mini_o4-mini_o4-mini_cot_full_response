Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent NoGW', content='A path from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 E and 8 N steps has 16 steps. Exactly 4 changes of direction means 5 runs of consecutive same steps. If it starts with E, there are 3 E-runs summing to 8 and 2 N-runs summing to 8: C(7,2)·C(7,1)=21·7=147. The same count applies if it starts with N. Total = 147+147 = 294.\n\nAnswer:294', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
