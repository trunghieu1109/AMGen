        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs when a U move follows an R move or vice versa. We need to partition the 16 moves into 5 segments (since 4 changes in direction create 5 segments) where each segment consists of consecutive R's or U's. The segments must add up to 8 R's and 8 U's. We can represent the segments as (R1, U1, R2, U2, R3, U3, R4, U4, R5, U5) where R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 = 8 and U1 + U2 + U3 + U4 + U5 = 8. The number of solutions to this is given by the multinomial coefficient \\( \\binom{8}{R1, R2, R3, R4, R5} \\binom{8}{U1, U2, U3, U4, U5} \\). Since each segment must be non-empty, we use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to partition 8 into 5 positive parts, which is \\( \\binom{7}{4} \\). Therefore, the number of such paths is \\( \\binom{7}{4}^2 \\).\n\nAnswer:441",
