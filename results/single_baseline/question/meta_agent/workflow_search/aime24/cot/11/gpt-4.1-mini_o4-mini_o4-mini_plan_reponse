        "response": "A path from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 E and 8 N steps has 16 steps. Exactly 4 changes of direction means 5 runs of consecutive same steps. If it starts with E, there are 3 E-runs summing to 8 and 2 N-runs summing to 8: C(7,2)\u00b7C(7,1)=21\u00b77=147. The same count applies if it starts with N. Total = 147+147 = 294.\n\nAnswer:294",
