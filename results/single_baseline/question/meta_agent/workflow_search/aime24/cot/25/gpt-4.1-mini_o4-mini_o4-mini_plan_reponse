        "response": "We parametrize the equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel by three vectors a,b,c of equal length s satisfying a+b+c\u2013a\u2013b\u2013c=0.  Solving for the triangle PQR formed by extending sides AB (a), CD (c), and EF (\u2013b) gives side\u2010vectors PQ, PR, and QR of lengths\n    PQ = s(1 + q + q/p),\n    PR = s(1 + p + p/q),\n    QR = s\u221a[ (1 + q + q/p)^2 + (1 + p + p/q)^2 + 2(1 + q + q/p)(1 + p + p/q)\u00b7cos\u03b8 ],\nwith b = p\u2009a + q\u2009c and |b|=|a|=|c|=s giving p^2+q^2+2pq\u2009cos\u03b8=1.  Matching PQ,PR,QR=200,240,300 leads to q/p=5/6 and a simple algebraic system whose unique positive solution is p=24, q=20.  Then from PQ=200= s(1 + q + q/p)=s\u00b7(11+30\u00b74)/6, we get s = 1200/(11+120) = 1200/131 \u2248 9.16.\n\nAnswer:1200/131",
