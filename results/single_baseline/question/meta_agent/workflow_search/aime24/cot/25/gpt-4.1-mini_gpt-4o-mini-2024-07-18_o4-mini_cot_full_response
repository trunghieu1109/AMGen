Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rLvT', content="To find the side length of the equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, we can use the relationship between the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF and the hexagon itself. The triangle has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. We can apply the formula for the area of a triangle using Heron's formula and relate it to the area of the hexagon. The area of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of its side length, and we can set up an equation to solve for the side length of the hexagon.\n\nAnswer:120", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
