Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DZAE', content='We parametrize the equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel by three vectors a,b,c of equal length s satisfying a+b+c–a–b–c=0.  Solving for the triangle PQR formed by extending sides AB (a), CD (c), and EF (–b) gives side‐vectors PQ, PR, and QR of lengths\n    PQ = s(1 + q + q/p),\n    PR = s(1 + p + p/q),\n    QR = s√[ (1 + q + q/p)^2 + (1 + p + p/q)^2 + 2(1 + q + q/p)(1 + p + p/q)·cosθ ],\nwith b = p\u2009a + q\u2009c and |b|=|a|=|c|=s giving p^2+q^2+2pq\u2009cosθ=1.  Matching PQ,PR,QR=200,240,300 leads to q/p=5/6 and a simple algebraic system whose unique positive solution is p=24, q=20.  Then from PQ=200= s(1 + q + q/p)=s·(11+30·4)/6, we get s = 1200/(11+120) = 1200/131 ≈ 9.16.\n\nAnswer:1200/131', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
