Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the triangle formed by the extensions is also equilateral. Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle must be in the ratio 1:1:1. However, the given side lengths are 200, 240, and 300, which are not equal, but they are in the ratio 5:6:7. This suggests that the hexagon's side length is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of these side lengths. The greatest common divisor of 200, 240, and 300 is 20. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 20 times the ratio factor, which is 5, 6, or 7. Since the hexagon is equilateral, we take the smallest possible side length that maintains the equilateral property, which is 20.
