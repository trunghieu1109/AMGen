Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent m5iv', content='We have triangle ABC with circumradius R=13, inradius r=6. Euler’s relation gives OI^2=R(R−2r)=13. The perpendicularity IA ⟂ OI makes triangle OIA right at I, so IA^2=OA^2−OI^2=169−13=156, hence IA=r/ sin(A/2)=2√39, so sin(A/2)=6/(2√39)=√39/13 and tan(A/2)=√(3/10). Using r=(s−a)tan(A/2) gives s−a=6/tan(A/2)=2√30, hence a=BC=2R sinA with sinA=2 sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2·(√39/13)·(√130/13)=2√5070/169=2·13√30/169=26√30/169 simplifies to a=4√30. Then s=6√30, so b+c=8√30. Law of cosines a^2=b^2+c^2−2bc cosA with cosA=91/169 leads to bc=720/(1+cosA)=468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
