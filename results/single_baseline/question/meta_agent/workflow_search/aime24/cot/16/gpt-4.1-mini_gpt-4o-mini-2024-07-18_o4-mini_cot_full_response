Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QdCi', content='We start with the given triangle ABC, where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. We know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which gives us a specific relationship between the circumradius R and the inradius r. The circumradius R is given as 13 and the inradius r is given as 6. We can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of the circumradius and inradius. The area A of triangle ABC can be expressed as A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter, and also as A = (abc) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. We can relate these quantities to find AB * AC. We also use the relationship between R, r, and the sides of the triangle. The condition IA ‚ä• OI implies a specific relationship that can be used to derive the product AB * AC. We will use the formula AB * AC = R^2 - r^2, which is derived from the properties of the triangle and the given conditions. Plugging in the values, we find AB * AC = 13^2 - 6^2 = 169 - 36 = 133.\n\nAnswer:133', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
