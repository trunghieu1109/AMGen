Note that\n\u2013 A(x)=4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) depends only on x and is 1\u2010periodic in x, with range [0,1].\n\u2013 B(y)=4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) depends only on y and is (2/3)\u2010periodic in y, with range [0,1].\nAn intersection (x,y) satisfies y=A(x) and x=B(y), so x=B(A(x)).  Since A is 1\u2010periodic and B\u2218A is therefore 1\u2010periodic, any solution x in [0,1) repeats in every integer translate.  We exhibit at least one solution in [0,1): for instance x=y=1 gives sin(2\u03c0\u22c51)=0 \u21d2A(1)=4g(f(0))=4g(\u00bd)=1, and cos(3\u03c0\u22c51)=cos3\u03c0=\u22121 \u21d2B(1)=4g(f(\u22121))=1, so (1,1) lies on both curves.  By periodicity in x of period 1 (and in y of period 2/3), each solution in [0,1]\u00d7[0,2/3] generates infinitely many in \u211d\u00b2.  Hence the two curves intersect infinitely many times.\n\nAnswer:Infinitely many",
