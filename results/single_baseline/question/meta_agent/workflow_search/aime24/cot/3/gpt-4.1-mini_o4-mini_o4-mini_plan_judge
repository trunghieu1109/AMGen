Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are asked to count all intersection points of the two plane curves
    y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))  and  x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))
where f(t)=||t|−½| and g(t)=||t|−¼|.  Note that
– A(x)=4g(f(sin(2πx))) depends only on x and is 1‐periodic in x, with range [0,1].
– B(y)=4g(f(cos(3πy))) depends only on y and is (2/3)‐periodic in y, with range [0,1].
An intersection (x,y) satisfies y=A(x) and x=B(y), so x=B(A(x)).  Since A is 1‐periodic and B∘A is therefore 1‐periodic, any solution x in [0,1) repeats in every integer translate.  We exhibit at least one solution in [0,1): for instance x=y=1 gives sin(2π⋅1)=0 ⇒A(1)=4g(f(0))=4g(½)=1, and cos(3π⋅1)=cos3π=−1 ⇒B(1)=4g(f(−1))=1, so (1,1) lies on both curves.  By periodicity in x of period 1 (and in y of period 2/3), each solution in [0,1]×[0,2/3] generates infinitely many in ℝ².  Hence the two curves intersect infinitely many times.
