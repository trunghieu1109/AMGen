        "response": "To find the number of intersections of the graphs of the given equations, we need to analyze the functions involved. First, consider the function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. This function takes the absolute value of x, subtracts 1/2, and then takes the absolute value again. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is similar, but with 1/4 instead of 1/2. The function f(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 1/2 and is symmetric about the y-axis. Similarly, g(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 1/4. Now, consider the composition of these functions with trigonometric functions. The function f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will have a period of 1, since sin(2\u03c0x) is periodic with period 1. Similarly, f(cos(3\u03c0y)) will have a period of 2/3, since cos(3\u03c0y) is periodic with period 2/3. The function g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will also have a period of 1, and g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) will have a period of 2/3. The equation y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) describes a curve in the xy-plane, and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) describes another curve. To find the intersections, we set y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) and solve for x and y. Since both sides are multiplied by 4, we can consider the intersections of g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). The function g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) takes values in [0, 1/4] and is periodic with period 1. Similarly, g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) takes values in [0, 1/4] and is periodic with period 2/3. The intersections occur when g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). Since both functions are periodic, we can consider the fundamental domain for x in [0, 1) and y in [0, 2/3). Within this domain, we need to count the number of solutions to g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) = g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). The function g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) is piecewise linear with breakpoints at x = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1. Similarly, g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is piecewise linear with breakpoints at y = 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3. By analyzing these piecewise linear functions, we find that there are 6 intersections within the fundamental domain.\n\nAnswer:6",
