    <pre>To find the number of intersections of the graphs of the two equations, we need to analyze the functions involved. First, we will explore the behavior of the functions f(x) and g(x). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| has critical points at x = -1/2, 0, and 1/2, and it is piecewise linear. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| has critical points at x = -1/4, 0, and 1/4. We will evaluate the ranges of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) to understand how g transforms these values. The sine and cosine functions oscillate between -1 and 1, so we will find the range of f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))). After determining the ranges, we will set the two equations equal to each other and analyze the resulting equation to find the number of solutions. This will involve solving for y in terms of x and vice versa, and counting the intersections. We will also consider the periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions to find the total number of intersections over the relevant intervals.
