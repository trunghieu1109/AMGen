        "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "We have a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, AD=BC=\u221a89. Such an \"isosceles\" tetrahedron has all four faces congruent, each a triangle with side\u2010squares 41,80,89. \n\n1. Compute face area T: for sides a^2=41,b^2=80,c^2=89,\n   16T^2 = 2(ab)^2+2(bc)^2+2(ca)^2 \u2013 (a^4+b^4+c^4)\n           =2(41\u00b780+80\u00b789+89\u00b741) \u2013 (41^2+80^2+89^2)\n           =2\u00b714049 \u2013 16002 =28098\u201316002=12096,\n   so T^2=756, T=6\u221a21.  Total surface S=4T=24\u221a21.\n\n2. Compute volume V via Cayley\u2013Menger (or opposite\u2010edge formula).  One finds V^2 =25600/9, so V=160/3.\n\n3. Inradius r =3V/S =3\u00b7(160/3)/(24\u221a21) =160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21) =(20\u221a21)/63.\n\nThus r = (20\u221a21)/63, so m=20,n=21,p=63, and m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\nAnswer:104",
