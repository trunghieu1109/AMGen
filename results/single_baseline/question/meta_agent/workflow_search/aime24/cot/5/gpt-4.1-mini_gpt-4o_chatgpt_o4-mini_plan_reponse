        "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "response": "The problem involves a tetrahedron with equal face distances from a point inside it, which suggests that the tetrahedron is isosceles. The given edge lengths are symmetric, indicating that the tetrahedron is isosceles. We can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths to find the volume. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices A, B, C, D and edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by the Cayley-Menger determinant. Once we have the volume, the distance from the point I to each face is the volume divided by the area of one of the faces. We calculate the area of one of the faces using Heron's formula. Finally, we express the distance in the form \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\) and find \\( m+n+p \\).\n\nAnswer:22",
