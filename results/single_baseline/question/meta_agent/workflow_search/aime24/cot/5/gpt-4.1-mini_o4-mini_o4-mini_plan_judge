Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We have a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89. Such an "isosceles" tetrahedron has all four faces congruent, each a triangle with side‐squares 41,80,89. 

1. Compute face area T: for sides a^2=41,b^2=80,c^2=89,
   16T^2 = 2(ab)^2+2(bc)^2+2(ca)^2 – (a^4+b^4+c^4)
           =2(41·80+80·89+89·41) – (41^2+80^2+89^2)
           =2·14049 – 16002 =28098–16002=12096,
   so T^2=756, T=6√21.  Total surface S=4T=24√21.

2. Compute volume V via Cayley–Menger (or opposite‐edge formula).  One finds V^2 =25600/9, so V=160/3.

3. Inradius r =3V/S =3·(160/3)/(24√21) =160/(24√21)=20/(3√21) =(20√21)/63.

Thus r = (20√21)/63, so m=20,n=21,p=63, and m+n+p=20+21+63=104.
