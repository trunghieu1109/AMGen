        "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "To find the distance from point I to the faces of tetrahedron ABCD, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron and the area of its faces. The distances from point I to each face are equal, which means we can express the volume in terms of the area of a face and the distance from I to that face. We will calculate the volume of tetrahedron ABCD using the given edge lengths and then find the area of one of the faces to determine the distance from I to the faces.\n\nAnswer:m+n+p = 41.",
