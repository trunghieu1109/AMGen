Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.",

        "response": "To find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume, we start by letting the dimensions of the box be denoted as x, y, and z. The surface area S and volume V of the box are given by the equations: S = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 and V = xyz = 23. We need to express the radius of the smallest enclosing sphere in terms of x, y, and z. The radius r of the sphere that can contain the box is given by r = sqrt((x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / 2). We will use the equations for surface area and volume to find a relationship between x, y, and z, and then find r^2. We will also use the method of Lagrange multipliers or inequalities to find the minimum value of r^2.\n\nAnswer:r^2 = \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{1156}{27}, p + q = 1183.",
