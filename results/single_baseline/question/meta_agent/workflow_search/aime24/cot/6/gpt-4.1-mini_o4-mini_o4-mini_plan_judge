Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest sphere that can contain each box in B, i.e. its radius must be half the maximal space‐diagonal among all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let the box have edges x,y,z>0. Then:
1. Surface area: 2(xy+yz+zx)=54 ⇒ xy+yz+zx=27.
2. Volume: xyz=23.
The sphere radius r for a given box is (1/2)√(x^2+y^2+z^2). We require r large enough to cover the box with the largest √(x^2+y^2+z^2), so r^2=(1/4)·max(x^2+y^2+z^2).
Let s=x+y+z, q=xy+yz+zx=27. Then x^2+y^2+z^2=s^2−2q=s^2−54. To maximize s^2, consider symmetry: at optimum two edges equal.  WLOG y=z.
Then xy+yz+zx=2xy+y^2=27 and xyz=xy^2=23. From xyz=23 ⇒ x=23/y^2. Plug into 2*(23/y^2)*y+y^2=27 ⇒ 46/y+y^2=27 ⇒ y^3−27y+46=0.  y=2 or y=−1±2√6. Positive roots: y=2 or y=−1+2√6≈3.899. 
Case y=2 ⇒ x=23/4=5.75, s=5.75+4=9.75 ⇒ x^2+y^2+z^2=9.75^2−54=95.0625−54=41.0625=657/16.
Case y≈3.899 ⇒ x≈1.513, s≈9.3109 ⇒ smaller s.
Thus the maximum of x^2+y^2+z^2 is 657/16 so r^2=(1/4)*(657/16)=657/64. These are relatively prime, so p+q=657+64=721.
