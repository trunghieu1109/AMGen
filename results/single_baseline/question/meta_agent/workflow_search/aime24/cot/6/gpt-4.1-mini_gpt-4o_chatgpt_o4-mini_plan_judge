Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with given surface area and volume. Let the dimensions of the box be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The surface area is $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$, and the volume is $xyz = 23$. The smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half the diagonal of the box. The diagonal $d$ of the box is given by $d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. We need to minimize $d$ subject to the constraints. Using the identity $(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)$, we can express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)$. Let $s = x+y+z$. Then $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54$. We also have $xyz = 23$. We need to minimize $\sqrt{s^2 - 54}$. By the AM-GM inequality, $\frac{s}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} = \sqrt[3]{23}$, so $s \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}$. We find $s$ such that $s^2 - 54$ is minimized. Solving for $s$ gives $s = \sqrt{54 + 2\sqrt{23}}$. The minimum value of $s^2 - 54$ is $\frac{54^2}{3^2} = 18$. Therefore, $r^2 = \frac{18}{1} = 18$. The value of $p+q$ is 18 + 1 = 19.
