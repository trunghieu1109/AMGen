Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Let's first determine Aya's walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. We know that when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 4 hours - t minutes. Since she walks 9 km, we have the equation 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes - t minutes. In hours, this is 2 + 24/60 - t/60 = 2.4 - t/60. We have the equation 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. We solve these two equations to find s and t. From the first equation, 9/s = 4 - t/60, we get t = 240 - 540/s. From the second equation, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60, we get t = 144 - 540/(s+2). Setting these two expressions for t equal gives 240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2). Solving for s, we find s = 3. With s = 3, we find t = 60. Now, if Aya walks at speed s + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Converting this to minutes and adding t, we find the total time.
