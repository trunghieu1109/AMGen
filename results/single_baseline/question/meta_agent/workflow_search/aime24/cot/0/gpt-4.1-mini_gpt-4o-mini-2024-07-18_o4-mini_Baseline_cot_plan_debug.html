    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the time Aya spends walking at speed s as T1 and the time spent in the coffee shop as t. The total time for the first scenario is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Therefore, T1 + t = 240. The distance is 9 km, so T1 = 9/s. Thus, we have 9/s + t = 240. For the second scenario, she walks at speed s + 2, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. So, T2 + t = 144. The time spent walking at speed s + 2 is T2 = 9/(s + 2). Therefore, we have 9/(s + 2) + t = 144. We now have two equations: 9/s + t = 240 and 9/(s + 2) + t = 144. We can solve these equations to find s and t. After finding s, we can calculate the time taken when she walks at speed s + 1/2, which is 9/(s + 1/2) + t. We will solve for s and t step by step.

Answer:The total time taken when Aya walks at speed s + 1/2, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is 180 minutes.</pre>
