Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let s=walking speed in km/h and t=coffee shop time in minutes. Distance is 9 km. Total time at speed s is 4 h: 9/s + t/60 = 4. At speed s+2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 h. Subtracting gives 4−2.4 = 9/s − 9/(s+2) = 1.6, and 9(1/s−1/(s+2)) = 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 so s(s+2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25 ⇒ s=2.5 km/h. Then t/60 = 4−9/2.5 = 0.4 ⇒ t=24 min. At speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3=3 h plus 0.4 h coffee =3.4 h =204 minutes.
