Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent GcOZ', content='Let A=ln x, B=ln y. Equations become e^A·B/A=10 and 4e^B·A/B=10. Multiply them: e^{A+B}·4=100 so e^{A+B}=25. Hence xy=e^{ln x+ln y}=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
