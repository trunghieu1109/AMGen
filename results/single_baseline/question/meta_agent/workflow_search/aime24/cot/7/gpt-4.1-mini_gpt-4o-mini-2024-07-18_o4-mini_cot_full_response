Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TY49', content='We start with the equations given in the problem: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). We can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form. The first equation gives us \\( y^x = x^{10} \\), and the second gives us \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\). We can express both equations in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and then solve for their product \\( xy \\).\n\nAnswer:100', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
