        "response": "We start with the equations given in the problem: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). We can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form. The first equation gives us \\( y^x = x^{10} \\), and the second gives us \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\). We can express both equations in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and then solve for their product \\( xy \\).\n\nAnswer:100",
