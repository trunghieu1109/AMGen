Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2dOB', content='We are given two logarithmic equations: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). We need to find the product \\( xy \\).\n\nFirst, consider the equation \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\). This means \\( y^x = x^{10} \\). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have:\n\\[ x \\log_{10}(y) = 10 \\log_{10}(x). \\]\n\nNext, consider the equation \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). This means \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have:\n\\[ 4y \\log_{10}(x) = 10 \\log_{10}(y). \\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( x \\log_{10}(y) = 10 \\log_{10}(x) \\)\n2. \\( 4y \\log_{10}(x) = 10 \\log_{10}(y) \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, solve for \\( \\log_{10}(y) \\):\n\\[ \\log_{10}(y) = \\frac{10 \\log_{10}(x)}{x}. \\]\n\nFrom the second equation, solve for \\( \\log_{10}(x) \\):\n\\[ \\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{10 \\log_{10}(y)}{4y}. \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\log_{10}(y) \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ \\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{10}{4y} \\cdot \\frac{10 \\log_{10}(x)}{x}. \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[ x = \\frac{100}{4y} = \\frac{25}{y}. \\]\n\nThus, \\( xy = 25 \\).\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
