Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We start with the equations given in the problem: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form. The first equation gives us \( y^x = x^{10} \), and the second gives us \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). We can express both equations in terms of \( x \) and \( y \) and then solve for their product \( xy \).
