Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let A=ln x, B=ln y. Equations become e^A·B/A=10 and 4e^B·A/B=10. Multiply them: e^{A+B}·4=100 so e^{A+B}=25. Hence xy=e^{ln x+ln y}=25.

Answer:25
Extracted answer: 25
Correct answer: 025
