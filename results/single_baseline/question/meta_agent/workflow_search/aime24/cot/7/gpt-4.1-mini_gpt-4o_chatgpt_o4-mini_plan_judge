proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We need to find the product \( xy \).

First, consider the equation \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This means \( y^x = x^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have:
\[ x \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(x). \]

Next, consider the equation \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). This means \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have:
\[ 4y \log_{10}(x) = 10 \log_{10}(y). \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( x \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(x) \)
2. \( 4y \log_{10}(x) = 10 \log_{10}(y) \)

From the first equation, solve for \( \log_{10}(y) \):
\[ \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10 \log_{10}(x)}{x}. \]

From the second equation, solve for \( \log_{10}(x) \):
\[ \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10 \log_{10}(y)}{4y}. \]

Substitute \( \log_{10}(y) \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \cdot \frac{10 \log_{10}(x)}{x}. \]

Simplify:
\[ x = \frac{100}{4y} = \frac{25}{y}. \]

Thus, \( xy = 25 \).
