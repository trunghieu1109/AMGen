    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the point C on the segment AB such that it does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \(\mathcal{F}\), except for the segment AB itself. The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We start by parameterizing the segment AB. The point A is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the point B is \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \(C = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) for \(0 \leq t \leq 1\). We need to find the condition under which C does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis can be parameterized as \(P = (x, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y)\) with \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). For C to lie on \(\overline{PQ}\), there must exist \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 1\) such that \(C = \lambda P + (1-\lambda)Q\). This gives the equations \(\frac{1}{2}(1-t) = \lambda x\) and \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = (1-\lambda)y\). Solving these equations for \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of \(t\) and \(\lambda\), and using the condition \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), we find that the only value of \(t\) for which C does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\) is \(t = \frac{1}{3}\). Substituting \(t = \frac{1}{3}\) into the parameterization of C, we get \(C = \left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is then \(OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{12}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{6}\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{7}{36}\), and \(p = 7\), \(q = 36\). Thus, \(p + q = 43\).
