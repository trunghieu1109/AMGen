Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9LYb', content='To solve this problem, we need to find the point C on the segment AB such that it does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), except for the segment AB itself. The family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consists of segments \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We start by parameterizing the segment AB. The point A is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)\\) and the point B is \\(\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \\(C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)\\) for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\). We need to find the condition under which C does not lie on any segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). A segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis can be parameterized as \\(P = (x, 0)\\) and \\(Q = (0, y)\\) with \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\). For C to lie on \\(\\overline{PQ}\\), there must exist \\(0 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 1\\) such that \\(C = \\lambda P + (1-\\lambda)Q\\). This gives the equations \\(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t) = \\lambda x\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t = (1-\\lambda)y\\). Solving these equations for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of \\(t\\) and \\(\\lambda\\), and using the condition \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), we find that the only value of \\(t\\) for which C does not lie on any segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is \\(t = \\frac{1}{3}\\). Substituting \\(t = \\frac{1}{3}\\) into the parameterization of C, we get \\(C = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)\\). The distance \\(OC\\) is then \\(OC = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{12}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{36}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{6}\\). Therefore, \\(OC^2 = \\frac{7}{36}\\), and \\(p = 7\\), \\(q = 36\\). Thus, \\(p + q = 43\\).\n\nAnswer:43', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
