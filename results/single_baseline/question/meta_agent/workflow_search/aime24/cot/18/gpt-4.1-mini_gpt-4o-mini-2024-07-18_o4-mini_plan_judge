Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To find the point C on the line segment AB that does not belong to any segment of unit length from the family F, we first need to determine the equation of the line segment AB. The coordinates of A and B are given, so we can find the slope and the equation of the line. The line segment AB can be parameterized, and we can find the distance from the origin O to any point C on this line. We need to ensure that the distance from O to C is not equal to the length of any segment from the family F, which consists of segments of unit length. We will derive the coordinates of C and calculate OC^2, then express it in the form p/q and find p + q.
