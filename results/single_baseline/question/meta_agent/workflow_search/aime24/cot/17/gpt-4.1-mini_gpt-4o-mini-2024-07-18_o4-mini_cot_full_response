Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent JrJp', content='To solve the problem, we need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equations given. The first equation is a linear equation in three variables, and the second equation is a quadratic form involving those variables. We can start by rewriting the second equation in a more manageable form and then analyze the constraints imposed by both equations.\n\nAnswer:0', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
