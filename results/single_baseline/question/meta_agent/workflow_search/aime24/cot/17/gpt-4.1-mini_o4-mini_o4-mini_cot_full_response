Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6wRu', content='We want nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and S=a^2b+a^2c+b^2a+b^2c+c^2a+c^2b=6{,}000{,}000.  Note that S=∑x^2(300−x)=300(a^2+b^2+c^2)−(a^3+b^3+c^3), which simplifies via symmetric sums to S=3(100(ab+bc+ca)−abc).  Setting 3(100e2−e3)=6{,}000{,}000 gives e3=100e2−2{,}000{,}000.  Equivalently, fixing c, one finds ab=100(200−c) and a+b=300−c.  The quadratic for a has discriminant (c−100)^2, yielding roots a=100 and a=200−c (and b the other).  Thus all solutions are permutations of (c,100,200−c) with 0≤c≤200.  There are 100 distinct 3-element multisets (for c=0…99) each giving 6 ordered triples, plus the one multiset {100,100,100}, giving 1.  Total=100·6+1=601.\n\nAnswer:601', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
