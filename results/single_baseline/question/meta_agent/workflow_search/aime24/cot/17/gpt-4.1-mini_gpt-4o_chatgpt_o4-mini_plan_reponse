        "response": "We are given two equations: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The first equation is a linear equation in three variables, and the second is a symmetric polynomial equation. We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. The second equation can be rewritten as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substituting these into the second equation gives a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This is a complex equation to solve directly, but we can try specific values for a, b, and c that satisfy a + b + c = 300 and check if they satisfy the second equation. By symmetry and trial, we find that a = b = c = 100 satisfies both equations: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 and 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) = 3 * 100^2 * 200 = 6,000,000. Therefore, the only solution is (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100).\n\nAnswer:1",
