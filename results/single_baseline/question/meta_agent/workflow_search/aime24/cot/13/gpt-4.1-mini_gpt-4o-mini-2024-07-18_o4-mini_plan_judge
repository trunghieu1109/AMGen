Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the inradius of triangle ABC, we first need to understand the arrangement of the circles. The eight circles of radius 34 are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle. The two circles that are tangent to sides AB and BC will help us determine the dimensions of the triangle. The arrangement of the 2024 circles of radius 1 will also provide insight into the scaling of the triangle. We can use the properties of tangential circles and the relationship between the radius of the circles and the inradius of the triangle to derive the inradius. The inradius can be expressed as a fraction, and we will find m and n such that they are coprime and then compute m+n.
