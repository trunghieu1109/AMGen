Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We interpret the chain of equal circles of radius r along the base AC of triangle ABC, each tangent to AC and to its neighbors, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last to BC.  If there are N circles of radius r, standard coordinates (AC horizontal) give that the first center has x-coordinate x1=r cot(A/2) and the last center is at xN=L–r cot(C/2).  Since centers are spaced 2r apart, xN–x1=2r(N–1), whence
  L = r[cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)+2(N–1)].
Applying this with (N=8,r=34) and (N=2024,r=1) to the same triangle yields
 34(u+14)=u+4046,
where u=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2).  Solving gives u=1190/11 and then L=AC=(45696/11).
But a well-known inradius formula is
  cot(A/2)+cot(B/2)+cot(C/2)=s/r_in,
and cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=(b)/r_in where b=AC, so r_in=AC/u=(45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5.  Hence m+n=192+5=197.
