    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that \( \omega^k \) are the 13th roots of unity, and they satisfy the equation \( x^{13} = 1 \). Therefore, \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). We need to evaluate the product of these terms for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \). Notice that for \( k = 0 \), the term is \( 2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1 \). For \( k \neq 0 \), we have \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). The product of all these terms is related to the polynomial \( P(x) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1 \). We are interested in the value of this product at a specific point. We can use the fact that the sum of the 13th roots of unity is zero, and the product of the non-zero 13th roots of unity is \( (-1)^{12} = 1 \). Therefore, the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is equal to \( 2^{12} \). We need to find the remainder of this product when divided by 1000. Calculating \( 2^{12} = 4096 \), and the remainder when 4096 is divided by 1000 is 96.
