Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xT1V', content='To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that \\( \\omega^k \\) are the 13th roots of unity, and they satisfy the equation \\( x^{13} = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( \\omega^{13} = 1 \\) and \\( \\omega^k \\neq 1 \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 12 \\). The expression \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} \\) can be rewritten as \\( (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1 \\). We need to evaluate the product of these terms for \\( k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12 \\). Notice that for \\( k = 0 \\), the term is \\( 2 - 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 1 \\). For \\( k \\neq 0 \\), we have \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1 \\). The product of all these terms is related to the polynomial \\( P(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) = x^{13} - 1 \\). We are interested in the value of this product at a specific point. We can use the fact that the sum of the 13th roots of unity is zero, and the product of the non-zero 13th roots of unity is \\( (-1)^{12} = 1 \\). Therefore, the product \\( \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) is equal to \\( 2^{12} \\). We need to find the remainder of this product when divided by 1000. Calculating \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\), and the remainder when 4096 is divided by 1000 is 96.\n\nAnswer:96', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
