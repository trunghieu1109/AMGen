Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zMO8', content='We need P=∏_{k=0 to 12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}), where ω runs through all 13th roots of unity except that ω^0=1 is included in k=0. Thus this is ∏_{r^13=1}f(r) with f(x)=x^2−2x+2. This equals the resultant Res(f(x),x^13−1). Equivalently, if α_1,α_2 are the roots of f(x), then P=∏_{i=1,2}(α_i^13−1). The roots of f are 1±i. Compute (1+i)^13−1: write 1+i=√2 e^{iπ/4}, so (1+i)^13=2^{6.5} e^{i13π/4}=64√2·(−e^{iπ/4})=−64−64i, hence (1+i)^13−1=−65−64i. Similarly (1−i)^13−1=conj=−65+64i. Their product is (−65)^2+(64)^2=4225+4096=8321. Thus P=8321, and 8321 mod 1000=321.\n\nAnswer:321', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
