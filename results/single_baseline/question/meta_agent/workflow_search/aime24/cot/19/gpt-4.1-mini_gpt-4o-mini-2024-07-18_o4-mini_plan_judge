Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first simplify the expression inside the product. We have the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^(2k). This can be rewritten as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^(2k). We can factor this expression further. The roots of unity will help us evaluate the product. We will also use properties of roots of unity and polynomial identities to simplify the product. Finally, we will compute the product and find the remainder when divided by 1000.
