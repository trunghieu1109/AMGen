Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by analyzing the expression n^4 + 1. We can rewrite it as n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means we need to find n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). We will check small prime numbers to see if they can satisfy this condition. We will also need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 once we find p.
