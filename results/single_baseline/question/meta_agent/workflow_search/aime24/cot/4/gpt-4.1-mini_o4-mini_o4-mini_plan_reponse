        "response": "We seek the least prime p for which n^4+1\u22610 mod p^2 has a solution. First, n^4\u2261\u22121 mod p implies p\u22611 mod8, so the least such prime is p=17. There are four solutions mod17, namely a\u22612,15,8,9, each lifting uniquely to mod17^2=289 by Hensel\u2019s lemma: for each root a we compute f(a)=a^4+1=17\u00b71, f'(a)=4a^3 mod17, then t\u2261\u2212(f(a)/17)/f'(a) mod17 and m=a+17t. This yields lifts m\u2261155,151,42,264 mod289. The smallest positive is m=42.\n\nAnswer:42",
