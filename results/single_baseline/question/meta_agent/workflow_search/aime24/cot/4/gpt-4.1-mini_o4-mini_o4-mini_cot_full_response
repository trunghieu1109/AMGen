Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 4X5F', content="We seek the least prime p for which n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution. First, n^4≡−1 mod p implies p≡1 mod8, so the least such prime is p=17. There are four solutions mod17, namely a≡2,15,8,9, each lifting uniquely to mod17^2=289 by Hensel’s lemma: for each root a we compute f(a)=a^4+1=17·1, f'(a)=4a^3 mod17, then t≡−(f(a)/17)/f'(a) mod17 and m=a+17t. This yields lifts m≡155,151,42,264 mod289. The smallest positive is m=42.\n\nAnswer:42", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
