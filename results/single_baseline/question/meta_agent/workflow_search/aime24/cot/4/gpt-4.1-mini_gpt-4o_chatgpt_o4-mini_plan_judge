proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We start by considering the condition n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means that -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We first check small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 is either 0 or 1 mod 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 2 works since 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 9. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 3 works since 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. For p = 7, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 49) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 49). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 5 works since 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 49. Therefore, the least prime p is 7. Now, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 49. We already found that m = 5 works, so m = 5 is the answer.
