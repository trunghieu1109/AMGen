    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming optimal play from the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player can force a win. 

Let&#39;s analyze the positions:

1. If there are 0 tokens, the player to move loses because they cannot make a move. So, 0 is a losing position.

2. If there is 1 token, Alice can take 1 token and win. So, 1 is a winning position.

3. If there are 2 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who will then win. So, 2 is a losing position.

4. If there are 3 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, who will then lose. So, 3 is a winning position.

5. If there are 4 tokens, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. So, 4 is a winning position.

6. If there are 5 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob, who will then win. So, 5 is a losing position.

7. If there are 6 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5 for Bob, who will then lose. So, 6 is a winning position.

8. If there are 7 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 6 for Bob, who will then win. So, 7 is a losing position.

9. If there are 8 tokens, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 for Bob, who will then win. So, 8 is a losing position.

10. If there are 9 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 8 for Bob, who will then lose. So, 9 is a winning position.

11. If there are 10 tokens, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 9 for Bob, who will then win. So, 10 is a losing position.

We observe a pattern: the losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, and so on. The pattern seems to be that a position is losing if it is of the form 5k, 5k+2, or 5k+3 for some integer k.

To find the number of losing positions less than or equal to 2024, we need to count the numbers of the form 5k, 5k+2, or 5k+3 up to 2024.

The numbers of the form 5k are 0, 5, 10, ..., 2020. There are 405 such numbers.

The numbers of the form 5k+2 are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. There are 405 such numbers.

The numbers of the form 5k+3 are 3, 8, 13, ..., 2023. There are 405 such numbers.

Therefore, the total number of losing positions is 405 + 405 + 405 = 1215.

Thus, there are 1215 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win.
