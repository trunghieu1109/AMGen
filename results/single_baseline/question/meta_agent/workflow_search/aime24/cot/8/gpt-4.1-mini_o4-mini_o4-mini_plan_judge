Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We want positions where the second player (Bob) wins, i.e. the initial position is losing for the first player. In the subtraction game with moves of size 1 or 4, the losing positions (P-positions) repeat with period 5 and occur exactly at n≡0 or 2 mod 5. For positive n ≤2024:  
– n≡0 mod 5 gives n=5,10,…,2020: there are ⌊2024/5⌋=404 values.  
– n≡2 mod 5 gives n=2,7,…,2022: there are ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=404+1=405 values.  
Total=404+405=809.
