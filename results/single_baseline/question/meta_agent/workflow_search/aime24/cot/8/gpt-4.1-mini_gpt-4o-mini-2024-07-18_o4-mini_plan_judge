Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game using winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where the player whose turn it is cannot force a win no matter what they do. Conversely, a winning position is one where the player can force a win. We can define the positions based on the number of tokens left. If Alice can leave Bob in a losing position after her turn, she can win. We will identify the losing positions for Bob and count how many integers n correspond to those positions up to 2024.
