        "response": "We need the total count of finite nonempty sets B whose maximum lies in A. For each a in A, the number of such B with max = a is the number of subsets of {1,\u2026,a\u22121} (each can be in or out) times 1 (a must be in), so 2^{a\u22121}. These counts over A are disjoint, so sum_{a in A} 2^{a\u22121}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024=2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Hence the multiset of exponents a\u22121 is {10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Sum of elements of A is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.\n\nAnswer:55",
