Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need the total count of finite nonempty sets B whose maximum lies in A. For each a in A, the number of such B with max = a is the number of subsets of {1,…,a−1} (each can be in or out) times 1 (a must be in), so 2^{a−1}. These counts over A are disjoint, so sum_{a in A} 2^{a−1}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024=2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Hence the multiset of exponents a−1 is {10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Sum of elements of A is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.
