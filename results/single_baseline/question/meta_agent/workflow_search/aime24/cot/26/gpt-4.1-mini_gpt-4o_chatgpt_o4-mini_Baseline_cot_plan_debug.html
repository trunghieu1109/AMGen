    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. We need to find the sum of the elements of A given that Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets.

For each element a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum element is a is 2^(a-1). This is because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to be in B, and we must include a itself.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a-1) for all a in A. We are given that this sum is 2024.

Let&#39;s find the possible values of A. We need to find integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 2^(a_1 - 1) + 2^(a_2 - 1) + ... + 2^(a_n - 1) = 2024.

Notice that 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

This suggests that A could be {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}, because:
- 2^(11-1) = 2^10
- 2^(10-1) = 2^9
- 2^(9-1) = 2^8
- 2^(8-1) = 2^7
- 2^(7-1) = 2^6
- 2^(6-1) = 2^5
- 2^(4-1) = 2^3

The sum of these powers of 2 is indeed 2024.

Now, we find the sum of the elements of A: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55.
