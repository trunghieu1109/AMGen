    <pre>Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

    <pre>Let the set A have k elements, denoted as a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, where a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; ... &lt; a_k. For each element a_i in A, the sets B can include any subset of the elements from A that are less than or equal to a_i, and must include a_i itself. The number of nonempty subsets of the elements less than or equal to a_i is 2^(i-1) (since there are i-1 elements less than a_i, and each can either be included or not). Therefore, for each a_i, the number of sets B that can be formed is 2^(i-1). The total number of sets B is the sum of these counts for all elements in A: 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1) = 2^k - 1. We know that this total equals 2024, so we have 2^k - 1 = 2024, which gives us 2^k = 2025. We need to find k such that 2^k = 2025. The closest power of 2 is 2048, which is 2^11, so k must be 11. The sum of the first k positive integers is k(k + 1)/2 = 11 * 12 / 2 = 66.
