Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent F7M3', content='To solve this problem, we use the concept of the power of a point and properties of tangents and secants. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, it lies on the polar of A with respect to the circle. This means that AD is the polar of D, and P is the point where AD intersects the circle again. By the power of a point theorem, we have AD^2 = AB * AC. We can use this to find AP.\n\nAnswer:14', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
