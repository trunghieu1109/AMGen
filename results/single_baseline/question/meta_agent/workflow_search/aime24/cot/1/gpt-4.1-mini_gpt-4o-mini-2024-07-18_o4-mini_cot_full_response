Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent vYTR', content="To find the length of segment AP, we will use the power of a point theorem and the properties of tangents to the circumcircle of triangle ABC. We first need to find the circumradius R of triangle ABC using the formula R = abc / (4K), where K is the area of the triangle. We can find K using Heron's formula. After calculating R, we will find the length of AD and then use the power of point D with respect to the circumcircle to find AP.\n\nAnswer:17", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
