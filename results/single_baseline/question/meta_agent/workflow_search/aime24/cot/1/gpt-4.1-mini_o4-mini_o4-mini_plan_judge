Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), solve A so that AB=5, AC=10 ⇒ A=(1/3,4√14/3).  The circumcenter O=(4.5,33/(4√14)), R=75/(4√14).  The tangents at B and C meet at D=(4.5,−27√14/11).  Parametrize line AD: A+ t(D−A), plug into circle equation.  The quadratic in t has roots t=0 (at A) and t=88/169.  Hence P=A+(88/169)(D−A) and AP=(88/169)|D−A|.  Compute |D−A|=325/22 ⇒ AP=(88/169)*(325/22)=1300/169=100/13.  Thus m+n=100+13=113.
