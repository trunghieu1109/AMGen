        "response": "We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), solve A so that AB=5, AC=10 \u21d2 A=(1/3,4\u221a14/3).  The circumcenter O=(4.5,33/(4\u221a14)), R=75/(4\u221a14).  The tangents at B and C meet at D=(4.5,\u221227\u221a14/11).  Parametrize line AD: A+ t(D\u2212A), plug into circle equation.  The quadratic in t has roots t=0 (at A) and t=88/169.  Hence P=A+(88/169)(D\u2212A) and AP=(88/169)|D\u2212A|.  Compute |D\u2212A|=325/22 \u21d2 AP=(88/169)*(325/22)=1300/169=100/13.  Thus m+n=100+13=113.\n\nAnswer:113",
