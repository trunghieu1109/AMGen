Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we use the concept of the power of a point and properties of tangents and secants. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, D lies on the polar of A with respect to the circle. This means that AD is the polar of D, and thus AD is the radical axis of the circle and the point D. By the power of a point theorem, the power of D with respect to the circle is equal to the power of A with respect to the circle. We can use the formula for the power of a point to find AP.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, it lies on the polar of A with respect to the circle. This means that AD is the polar of D, and P is the point where AD intersects the circle again. By the power of a point theorem, we have AD^2 = AB * AC. We can use this to find AP.
