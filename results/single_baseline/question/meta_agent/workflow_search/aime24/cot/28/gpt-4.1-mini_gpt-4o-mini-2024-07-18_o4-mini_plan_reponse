        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus rests on the sphere, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation. The torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. The torus will be tangent to the sphere at two different circles depending on its orientation. We can find the inner and outer radii of the circles of tangency using the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of tangents. The inner radius will be the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner edge of the torus, and the outer radius will be the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer edge of the torus. The difference between these two radii will give us the required value.\n\nAnswer:5",
