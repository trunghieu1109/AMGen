        "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "We set up the torus (tube radius a=3, central radius R=6) and a sphere of radius 11. Place the torus axis vertical with center at the origin, and the sphere center at (0,0,\u2212D), so the sphere lies below. In the meridian (r,z)\u2013plane one has\n  g(r,z)\u2254(r\u22126)\u00b2+z\u00b2\u22129=0   (torus)\n  h(r,z)\u2254r\u00b2+(z+D)\u00b2\u2212121=0  (sphere)\nAt tangency these two curves meet with parallel gradients: \u2207g=\u03bb\u2207h.  This gives\n  r\u22126=\u03bbr,\n  z=\u03bb(z+D),\n  g=0,\n  h=0.\nEliminating \u03bb and D leads to (r\u22126)\u00b2 = (9/121)r\u00b2.  Hence r\u22126=\u00b1(3/11)r, giving two solutions\n  r\u2081 =33/4  and  r\u2082=33/7.\nThese are the two contact\u2010circle radii.  Taking r_i=33/4, r_o=33/7 gives\n  r_i\u2212r_o =33(1/4\u22121/7)=33\u00b73/28=99/28,\nso m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127",
