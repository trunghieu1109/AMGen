    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We set up the torus (tube radius a=3, central radius R=6) and a sphere of radius 11. Place the torus axis vertical with center at the origin, and the sphere center at (0,0,−D), so the sphere lies below. In the meridian (r,z)–plane one has
  g(r,z)≔(r−6)²+z²−9=0   (torus)
  h(r,z)≔r²+(z+D)²−121=0  (sphere)
At tangency these two curves meet with parallel gradients: ∇g=λ∇h.  This gives
  r−6=λr,
  z=λ(z+D),
  g=0,
  h=0.
Eliminating λ and D leads to (r−6)² = (9/121)r².  Hence r−6=±(3/11)r, giving two solutions
  r₁ =33/4  and  r₂=33/7.
These are the two contact‐circle radii.  Taking r_i=33/4, r_o=33/7 gives
  r_i−r_o =33(1/4−1/7)=33·3/28=99/28,
so m+n=99+28=127.
