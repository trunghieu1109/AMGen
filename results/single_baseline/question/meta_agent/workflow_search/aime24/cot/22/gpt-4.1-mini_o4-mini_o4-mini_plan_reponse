        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "We require a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9, and an even number of terms so the median is the average of two middle items. That median must be an integer not in the list. Let k be the count of 9\u2019s. If k=2, the other two numbers sum to 12 and must be distinct (so they don\u2019t tie the mode). The only pair is {5,7}, giving the list {5,7,9,9}. Its median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list, and the sum is 30. No other k works. Then the sum of squares is 5\u00b2+7\u00b2+9\u00b2+9\u00b2 = 25+49+81+81 = 236.\n\nAnswer:236",
