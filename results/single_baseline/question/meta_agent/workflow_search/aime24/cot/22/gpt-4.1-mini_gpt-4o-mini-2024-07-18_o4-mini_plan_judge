Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that meets the specified conditions. The sum of the items in the list is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not present in the list. We start by determining how many times 9 must appear in the list to be the unique mode. Since the mode is unique, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. We can try different counts for 9 and see how we can fill the rest of the list while satisfying the sum and median conditions. After testing various combinations, we find that a valid list is [9, 9, 9, 3]. This list has a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median of 9, which is not allowed. We adjust the list to [9, 9, 9, 1, 2] which gives a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median of 2, which is not in the list. Finally, we calculate the sum of the squares of the items in the list: 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 = 248.
