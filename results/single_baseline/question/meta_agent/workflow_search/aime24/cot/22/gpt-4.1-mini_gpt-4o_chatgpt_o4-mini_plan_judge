Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions. Let's denote the list as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \). The conditions are: 1) The sum of the items is 30. 2) The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. 3) The median is a positive integer not in the list. Since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements, say \( 2m \), and the median is the average of the \( m \)-th and \( (m+1) \)-th elements. Let's try to construct such a list. We need 9 to appear more than any other number, so let's assume 9 appears at least 3 times. Suppose the list has 6 elements (\( n = 6 \)). Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. If 9 is the mode, it should appear at least 3 times, and the median should be an integer not in the list. Let's try the list: \( 1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 6 \). The sum is 1 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 6 = 39, which is too high. Let's try another configuration: \( 1, 8, 9, 9, 9, 4 \). The sum is 1 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 4 = 40, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 7, 9, 9, 9, 5 \). The sum is 1 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 40, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5 \). The sum is 1 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 39, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 6 \). The sum is 1 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 6 = 39, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 4, 9, 9, 9, 7 \). The sum is 1 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 7 = 39, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 8 \). The sum is 1 + 3 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 39, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 10 \).

The median is (2 + 9) / 2 = 5.5, which is not an integer. Let's try: \( 1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 1 \). The sum is 1 + 3 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 32, still too high. Let's try: \( 1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0 \).
