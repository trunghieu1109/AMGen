Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We require a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9, and an even number of terms so the median is the average of two middle items. That median must be an integer not in the list. Let k be the count of 9’s. If k=2, the other two numbers sum to 12 and must be distinct (so they don’t tie the mode). The only pair is {5,7}, giving the list {5,7,9,9}. Its median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list, and the sum is 30. No other k works. Then the sum of squares is 5²+7²+9²+9² = 25+49+81+81 = 236.
