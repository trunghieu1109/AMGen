    <pre>We have a 2x3 grid where we need to place digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let&#39;s denote the grid as follows:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array} \]

The conditions are:
1. The number formed by the first row (abc) plus the number formed by the second row (def) equals 999.
2. The number formed by the first column (ad) plus the number formed by the second column (be) plus the number formed by the third column (cf) equals 99.

Let&#39;s express these conditions mathematically:
- \( 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999 \)
- \( 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 \)

We can simplify the second equation:
- \( 10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99 \)

Now, let&#39;s subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f) = 999 - 99
\]
\[
90a - 9c + 99d + 9e = 900
\]
\[
10a - c + 11d + e = 100
\]

Now, let&#39;s solve for possible values of a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy both equations. We will try different values for a and d, and check if the equations can be satisfied.

Let&#39;s try a = 9, since 10a should be close to 100:
- If a = 9, then 10a = 90, so 90 - c + 11d + e = 100.
- This simplifies to -c + 11d + e = 10.

Now, let&#39;s try d = 0, since 11d should be small:
- If d = 0, then -c + e = 10.

Now, let&#39;s try different values for c and e:
- If c = 0, then e = 10, which is not possible since e must be a digit.
- If c = 1, then e = 11, which is not possible.
- If c = 2, then e = 12, which is not possible.
- If c = 3, then e = 13, which is not possible.
- If c = 4, then e = 14, which is not possible.
- If c = 5, then e = 15, which is not possible.
- If c = 6, then e = 16, which is not possible.
- If c = 7, then e = 17, which is not possible.
- If c = 8, then e = 18, which is not possible.
- If c = 9, then e = 19, which is not possible.

Let&#39;s try d = 1:
- If d = 1, then -c + 11 + e = 10.
- This simplifies to -c + e = -1.

Now, let&#39;s try different values for c and e:
- If c = 0, then e = -1, which is not possible.
- If c = 1, then e = 0, which is possible.

Now, let&#39;s check if these values satisfy the original equations:
- a = 9, b = 9, c = 1, d = 1, e = 0, f = 8.
- First equation: 991 + 8 = 999, which is satisfied.
- Second equation: 91 + 9 + 8 = 99, which is satisfied.

Therefore, the grid is:
\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline \end{array} \]

Now, let&#39;s check if there are other possible solutions. We have tried different values for a and d, and found that this is the only solution that satisfies both equations.

Therefore, there is only one way to place the digits in the grid.
