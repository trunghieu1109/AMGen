Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SF61', content='Label the top row digits A,B,C and bottom row D,E,F. The row sums give 100(A+D)+10(B+E)+(C+F)=999 so A+D=B+E=C+F=9. The column sums give 10(A+B+C)+(D+E+F)=99, combined with (A+D)+(B+E)+(C+F)=27, yielding A+B+C=8. Any nonnegative A,B,C summing to 8 (with resulting D=9-A etc. in range) works. Number of solutions = C(8+3-1,2)=C(10,2)=45.\n\nAnswer:45', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
