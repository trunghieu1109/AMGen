Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the conditions given for the 2x3 grid. The grid can be represented as follows:

```
| a1 | a2 | a3 |
| b1 | b2 | b3 |
```

Where `a1`, `a2`, `a3` are the digits in the first row and `b1`, `b2`, `b3` are the digits in the second row. The conditions state that:
1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, which translates to:
   - `a1 * 100 + a2 * 10 + a3 + b1 * 100 + b2 * 10 + b3 = 999`
2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, which translates to:
   - `a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + a3 + b3 = 99`

From the first condition, we can express it as:
- `100(a1 + b1) + 10(a2 + b2) + (a3 + b3) = 999`

From the second condition, we can express it as:
- `a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + a3 + b3 = 99`

We can denote:
- `x = a1 + b1`
- `y = a2 + b2`
- `z = a3 + b3`

Thus, we have:
- `100x + 10y + z = 999`
- `x + y + z = 99`

From the second equation, we can express `z` as:
- `z = 99 - x - y`

Substituting `z` into the first equation gives:
- `100x + 10y + (99 - x - y) = 999`
- `99x + 9y = 900`
- `11x + y = 100`

Now we can express `y` in terms of `x`:
- `y = 100 - 11x`

Next, we need to find valid integer values for `x` and `y` such that both are non-negative and `y` is a digit (0-9). This gives us:
- `0 <= 100 - 11x <= 9`
- `91 <= 11x <= 100`
- `8.27 <= x <= 9.09`

Thus, the only integer solution for `x` is `9`. Substituting `x = 9` gives:
- `y = 100 - 11*9 = 1`
- `z = 99 - 9 - 1 = 89`

Now we have:
- `a1 + b1 = 9`
- `a2 + b2 = 1`
- `a3 + b3 = 89`

Since `a3 + b3` must be a two-digit number, we can only have `a3 = 8` and `b3 = 1` (the only valid digits). This gives us:
- `a1 + b1 = 9` (possible pairs: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0))
- `a2 + b2 = 1` (possible pairs: (0,1), (1,0))

Now we can count the combinations:
- For each of the 10 pairs of (a1, b1), we can pair it with 2 pairs of (a2, b2). Thus, the total number of combinations is:
- `10 * 2 = 20`.

Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 20.
