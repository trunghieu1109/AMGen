Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= a, c < b) and a is non-zero. The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. This gives us the equation ab + c = (a + c)^2. Rearranging, we get ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2. Simplifying, we have ab = a^2 + ac + c^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 solutions (a, c) with 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b satisfying this equation. We will test increasing values of b starting from b = 2.
