Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, which means it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b, and 0 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b. The sum of the digits a and c must equal sqrt(n). We will iterate through values of b starting from 2 and count the number of b-beautiful integers for each b until we find the first b that has more than ten such integers.

Answer:The least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is 13.
Extracted answer: The least integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is 13.
Correct answer: 211
