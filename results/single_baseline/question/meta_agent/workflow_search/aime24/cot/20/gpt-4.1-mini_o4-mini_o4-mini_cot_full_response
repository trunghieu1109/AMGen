Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent c9Bh', content='We seek two‐digit base-b numbers n=ab+c (with 1≤a≤b−1,0≤c≤b−1) satisfying a+c=√n, i.e. (a+c)²=ab+c.  Set s=a+c so ab+c=s² ⇒ c=s²−ab and also c=s−a ⇒ s−a=s²−ab ⇒ s²−s=a(b−1), so a=s(s−1)/(b−1).  Hence b−1 must divide s(s−1).  Writing d=b−1, s runs 1…d, and s(s−1)≡0 mod d iff for each prime p|d, s≡0 or 1 mod p^{e}.  If d has k distinct prime factors, there are 2^k solutions s mod d; in 1…d this gives 2^k values.  Excluding s=1 (a=0) leaves at most 2^k−1 valid.  To exceed ten beautiful numbers need 2^k−1>10 ⇒2^k≥12⇒k≥4.  The smallest d with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=d+1=211, yielding 2^4−1=15 solutions.  No smaller b can give >10. \n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
