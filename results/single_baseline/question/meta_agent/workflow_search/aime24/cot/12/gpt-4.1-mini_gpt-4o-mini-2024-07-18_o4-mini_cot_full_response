Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent V6u9', content='To find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, we start by letting z = 4e^{i\theta} since |z| = 4. Then we can express the terms in the expression in terms of theta. We will compute the real part of the expression and maximize it with respect to theta.\n\nAnswer:75', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
