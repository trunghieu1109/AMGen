Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, we start by letting z = 4e^{i	heta} since |z| = 4. Then we can express the terms in the expression in terms of theta. We will compute the real part of the expression and maximize it with respect to theta.

Answer:75
Extracted answer: 75
