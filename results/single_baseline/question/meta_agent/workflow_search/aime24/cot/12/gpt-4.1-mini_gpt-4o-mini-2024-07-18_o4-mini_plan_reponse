        "response": "To find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, we start by letting z = 4e^{i\theta} since |z| = 4. Then we can express the terms in the expression in terms of theta. We will compute the real part of the expression and maximize it with respect to theta.\n\nAnswer:75",
