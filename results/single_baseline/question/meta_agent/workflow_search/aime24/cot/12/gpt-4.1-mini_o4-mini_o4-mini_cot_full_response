Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent k9Fo', content='We want max of Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] for |z|=4. Set z=4e^{iθ}. Then expression = Re[4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/4 e^{-iθ}] = Re[(300+468i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}]. This equals (300+24)cosθ +(-468+36)sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ. The maximum of P cosθ + Q sinθ is √(P^2+Q^2)=√(324^2+432^2)=√(108^2*(3^2+4^2))=108*5=540.\n\nAnswer:540', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
