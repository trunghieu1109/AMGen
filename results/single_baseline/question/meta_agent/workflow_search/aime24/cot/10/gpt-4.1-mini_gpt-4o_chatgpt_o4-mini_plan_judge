Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with certain conditions. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear, and A, D, H, G are concyclic. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is part of the line segment DECF. We can use the given lengths of the sides of the rectangles to find CE. Since BC = 16 and FG = 17, and D, E, C, F are collinear, we can find the total length of DECF as the sum of BC and FG, which is 16 + 17 = 33. Since DECF is a straight line, CE is the difference between the total length DECF and the sum of BC and FG. Therefore, CE = 33 - 16 = 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is part of the line segment DECF. We can use the given lengths of the sides of the rectangles to find CE. In rectangle ABCD, BC = 16, so CD = 107. In rectangle EFGH, FG = 17, so EF = 184. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, we can find CE by considering the total length of DECF and subtracting the known segments. DE = EF = 184, and CF = CD + FG = 107 + 17 = 124. Therefore, CE = DE - CF = 184 - 124.
