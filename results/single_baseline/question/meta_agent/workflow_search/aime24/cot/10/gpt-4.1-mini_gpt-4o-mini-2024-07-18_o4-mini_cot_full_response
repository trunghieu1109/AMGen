Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8T1r', content="We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with specific dimensions given. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear, and points A, D, H, and G lie on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. First, we can determine the coordinates of the points based on the dimensions of the rectangles. Let's place rectangle ABCD in the coordinate system. Let A be at (0, 0), B at (0, 107), C at (16, 107), and D at (16, 0). Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can place E and F accordingly. The length of CE can be calculated using the coordinates of C and E.\n\nAnswer:184", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
