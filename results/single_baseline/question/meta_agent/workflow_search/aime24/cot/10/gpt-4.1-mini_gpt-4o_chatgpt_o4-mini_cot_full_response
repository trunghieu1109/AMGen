Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bjsx', content='We are given two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with certain conditions. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear, and A, D, H, G are concyclic. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is part of the line segment DECF. We can use the given lengths of the sides of the rectangles to find CE. In rectangle ABCD, BC = 16, so CD = 107. In rectangle EFGH, FG = 17, so EF = 184. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, we can find CE by considering the total length of DECF and subtracting the known segments. DE = EF = 184, and CF = CD + FG = 107 + 17 = 124. Therefore, CE = DE - CF = 184 - 124.\n\nAnswer:60', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
