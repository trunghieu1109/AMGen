        "response": "We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with specific dimensions given. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear, and points A, D, H, and G lie on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. First, we can determine the coordinates of the points based on the dimensions of the rectangles. Let's place rectangle ABCD in the coordinate system. Let A be at (0, 0), B at (0, 107), C at (16, 107), and D at (16, 0). Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can place E and F accordingly. The length of CE can be calculated using the coordinates of C and E.\n\nAnswer:184",
