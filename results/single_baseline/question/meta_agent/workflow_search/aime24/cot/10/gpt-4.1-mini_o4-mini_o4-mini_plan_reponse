        "correct_answer": "104",
        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "We set A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). The line DC is y=16, on which E and F lie with EF=184, so if E=(x_E,16), F=(x_E+184,16). Rectangle EFGH goes \u201cup\u201d to H and G at y=33. The circle through A,D,H has center on y=8. Imposing that G also lies on it forces (y_H\u20138)^2 = x_E(x_E+184)+64 with y_H=33, giving x_E=3 or \u2013187. The intended order D,E,C,F is only satisfied by x_E=3. Hence CE=|107\u20133|=104.\n\nAnswer:104",
