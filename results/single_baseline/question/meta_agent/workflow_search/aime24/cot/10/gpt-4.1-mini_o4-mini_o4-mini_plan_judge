Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We set A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). The line DC is y=16, on which E and F lie with EF=184, so if E=(x_E,16), F=(x_E+184,16). Rectangle EFGH goes “up” to H and G at y=33. The circle through A,D,H has center on y=8. Imposing that G also lies on it forces (y_H–8)^2 = x_E(x_E+184)+64 with y_H=33, giving x_E=3 or –187. The intended order D,E,C,F is only satisfied by x_E=3. Hence CE=|107–3|=104.
