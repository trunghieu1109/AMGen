Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "We need maximal chip\u2010placements on a 5\u00d75 grid with at most one chip per cell, rows and columns monochromatic, and no further chip can be added without breaking the monotonicity conditions.  A maximal configuration must use all 5 rows and 5 columns; assign each row and each column a color (white/black), and place chips exactly at intersections where the row and column colors agree.   There are 2^5 choices for row colors and 2^5 for column colors, but globally flipping all row and column colors leaves the placement unchanged, so we divide by 2.  Thus the number of distinct arrangements is 2^{10}/2=512.\n\nAnswer:512",
