    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to consider how to fill the 5x5 grid with the chips while adhering to the given conditions. Each row and each column can only contain chips of one color, and we can have at most one chip per cell. This means that if we choose to place chips in a row, all chips in that row must be of the same color, and the same applies to columns. We can have rows filled with white chips, black chips, or left empty. The same applies to columns. The key is to determine how many rows and columns can be filled with each color while ensuring that the grid is filled in a way that no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions. We can represent the filling of the grid by choosing a certain number of rows to be filled with white chips and a certain number of columns to be filled with black chips, and vice versa. We can also leave some rows and columns empty. The total number of configurations can be calculated by considering all combinations of filled and empty rows and columns for both colors.

Answer:The total number of ways to place the chips is 252.</pre>
