Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that each row and each column can either be entirely filled with white chips, entirely filled with black chips, or be empty. Since there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, we can fill exactly 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. This is because filling a row with white chips uses 5 white chips, and filling a column with black chips uses 5 black chips. Therefore, we need to choose 5 rows to fill with white chips and 5 columns to fill with black chips. The number of ways to choose 5 rows from 5 is 1 (since we must choose all rows), and the number of ways to choose 5 columns from 5 is also 1. Thus, there is exactly 1 way to place the chips according to the given conditions.
