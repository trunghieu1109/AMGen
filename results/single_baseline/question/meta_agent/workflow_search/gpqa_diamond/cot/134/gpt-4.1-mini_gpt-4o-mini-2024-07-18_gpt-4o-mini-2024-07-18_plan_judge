Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, which allows it to decay into pairs of lighter particles. The allowed decay channels must involve particles whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. The decay channels listed in the choices include various quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. I need to evaluate each choice to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed based on the mass of the particles involved.

Answer:The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}.
Extracted answer: The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}.
Correct answer: 1
