Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SubD', content='The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, which allows it to decay into pairs of lighter particles. The allowed decay channels must involve particles whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. The decay channels listed in the choices include various quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. I need to evaluate each choice to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed based on the mass of the particles involved.\n\nAnswer:The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are: X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}.', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
