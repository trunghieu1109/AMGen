The allowed decay channels must involve particles whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. The decay channels listed in the choices include various quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. I need to evaluate each choice to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed based on the mass of the particles involved.\n\nAnswer:The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are: X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}.",
