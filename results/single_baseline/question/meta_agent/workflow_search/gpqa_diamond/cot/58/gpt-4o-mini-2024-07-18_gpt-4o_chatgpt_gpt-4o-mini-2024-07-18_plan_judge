Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the pH of the solution, we need to calculate the moles of each component and see how they react. First, calculate the moles of each component: CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles; HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles; Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely to give 2 OH- ions per formula unit, so it provides 0.18 moles of OH-. The HCl will react with the OH- first: 0.08 moles of HCl will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted. The remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- unreacted. The total volume of the solution is 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.0417 M. The pOH is -log(0.0417) = 1.38. The pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
