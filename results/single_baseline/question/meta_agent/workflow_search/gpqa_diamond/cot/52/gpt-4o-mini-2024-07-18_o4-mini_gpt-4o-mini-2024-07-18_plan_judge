Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: A di-substituted benzene with an ester and a vinyl substituent (–CO2Me and –CH=CH–CH3) would show: 4 aromatic H (2 signals × 2H), 2 vinyl H (one as a doublet, one as a doublet of quartets), and 2 methyl groups (Me of ester as singlet, vinyl Me as doublet). Total H = 4+2+6 = 12 and C = 6 (ring) + 2 (CO2Me) + 3 (vinyl) = 11, with O2 from the ester. Formula is C11H12O2, which is choice D).
