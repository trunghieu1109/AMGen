Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group. The FTIR confirms the ester group. The 1H NMR shows six signals: two aromatic-H, two vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. There are no –CH2 groups. The presence of two vinyl-H suggests a vinyl group, likely from an ester like an acrylate. The two –CH3 groups suggest two methyl groups, possibly on the aromatic ring or as part of the ester. The aromatic ring is likely a benzene ring with two substituents. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. The formula must account for the aromatic ring (C6H4), the ester group (C2H2O2), and the additional groups. C12H14O2 fits: C6H4 (aromatic) + C2H2O2 (ester) + C4H8 (two CH3 and vinyl).
