            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "To determine the chemical formula of the compound, we analyze the information given. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which suggests it has a benzene ring with two substituents. The presence of an ester group indicates that there is a carbonyl (C=O) and an alkoxy (\u2013O\u2013R) group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons, and two for methyl (\u2013CH3) groups, with no signals for \u2013CH2 groups. This suggests that the compound has a total of 12 hydrogen atoms. The presence of the ester group contributes to the oxygen count. We need to find a formula that matches these criteria. The options provided are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. The total number of carbons and hydrogens must align with the signals observed in the NMR spectrum. The correct formula should have 12 hydrogens and 2 oxygens, which leads us to C12H14O2 as the most fitting option, as it accounts for the aromatic structure and the substituents described.\n\nAnswer:C12H14O2",
