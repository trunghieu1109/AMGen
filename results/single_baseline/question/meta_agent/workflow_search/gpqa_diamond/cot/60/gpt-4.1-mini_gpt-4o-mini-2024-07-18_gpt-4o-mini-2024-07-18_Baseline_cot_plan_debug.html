    <pre>To determine the final product 5, we need to analyze the sequence of reactions step by step. Starting with benzene, nitration with HNO3 and H2SO4 introduces a nitro group, leading to product 1. The subsequent bromination with Br2 and iron powder will add a bromine atom to the aromatic ring, resulting in product 2. The hydrogenation with Pd/C will reduce the nitro group to an amine, giving product 3. The treatment with NaNO2 and HBF4 will convert the amine to a diazonium salt, which can then undergo a coupling reaction with anisole to form product 5. The position of the substituents will determine the final structure, and based on the choices provided, the correct final product is identified as 3-bromo-4&#39;-methoxy-1,1&#39;-biphenyl, which corresponds to choice 2.
