    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;}

    <pre>The state components in the P_z eigenbasis are a₁=−1/2 (m=+1), a₂=1/√2 (m=0), a₃=−1/2 (m=−1). 〈P_z〉=ℏ(|a₁|²−|a₃|²)=ℏ(1/4−1/4)=0. 〈P_z²〉=ℏ²(|a₁|²+|a₃|²)=ℏ²(1/4+1/4)=ℏ²/2.  Hence (ΔP_z)²=ℏ²/2 ⇒ ΔP_z=ℏ/√2.
