Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let’s compare densities:

Option a: Earth-mass, Earth-radius → density ≃5.51 g/cm³ (Earth’s density).
Option b: Given mass 2 M⊕ and density ≃5.5 g/cm³ → 5.5 g/cm³.
Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 M⊕. Rocky planets get denser with mass because gravity compresses them. Using mass–radius scaling (R ∝ M^0.27 for rocky planets): R ≃5^0.27 ≃1.55 R⊕, so volume ∝1.55³ ≃3.7, density ∝5/3.7 ≃1.35×Earth → ≃7.4–7.5 g/cm³.
Option d: Same composition, 0.5 M⊕. R ≃0.5^0.27 ≃0.83 R⊕, volume ≃0.83³ ≃0.57, density ≃0.5/0.57 ≃0.88×Earth → ≃4.8 g/cm³.

Highest is option c (≈7.5 g/cm³).
