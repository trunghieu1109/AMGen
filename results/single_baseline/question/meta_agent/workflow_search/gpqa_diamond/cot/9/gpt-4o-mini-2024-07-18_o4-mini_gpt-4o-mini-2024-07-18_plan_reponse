        "response": "Let\u2019s compare densities:\n\nOption a: Earth-mass, Earth-radius \u2192 density \u22435.51 g/cm\u00b3 (Earth\u2019s density).\nOption b: Given mass 2 M\u2295 and density \u22435.5 g/cm\u00b3 \u2192 5.5 g/cm\u00b3.\nOption c: Same composition as Earth but 5 M\u2295. Rocky planets get denser with mass because gravity compresses them. Using mass\u2013radius scaling (R \u221d M^0.27 for rocky planets): R \u22435^0.27 \u22431.55 R\u2295, so volume \u221d1.55\u00b3 \u22433.7, density \u221d5/3.7 \u22431.35\u00d7Earth \u2192 \u22437.4\u20137.5 g/cm\u00b3.\nOption d: Same composition, 0.5 M\u2295. R \u22430.5^0.27 \u22430.83 R\u2295, volume \u22430.83\u00b3 \u22430.57, density \u22430.5/0.57 \u22430.88\u00d7Earth \u2192 \u22434.8 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nHighest is option c (\u22487.5 g/cm\u00b3).\n\nAnswer:C)",
