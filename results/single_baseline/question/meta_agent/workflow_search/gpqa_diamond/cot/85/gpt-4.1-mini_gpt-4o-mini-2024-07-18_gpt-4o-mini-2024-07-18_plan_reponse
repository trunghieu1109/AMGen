        "response": "To determine the proper starting materials for the reactions, we need to analyze the products formed from each reaction. The product from the first reaction is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and the product from the second reaction is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This suggests that the starting materials must be chiral compounds that, when treated with the respective reducing agents, yield the specified enantiomers. The choices provided give different configurations for compounds A and B. We need to find the combination that matches the products' stereochemistry. The correct choice should have A yielding (R) and B yielding (S). Analyzing the choices, choice 4 has A as (R) and B as (S), which matches the required products.\n\nAnswer:choice4",
