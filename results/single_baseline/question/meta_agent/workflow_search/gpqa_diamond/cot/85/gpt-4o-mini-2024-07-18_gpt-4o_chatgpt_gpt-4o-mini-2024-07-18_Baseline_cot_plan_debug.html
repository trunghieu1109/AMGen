    <pre>The problem involves two reactions where two different reducing agents are used to convert two different starting materials into enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. LiBH4 is known to reduce esters to alcohols, while BH3 is known to reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material. For reaction A, LiBH4 reduces the ester group, and the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicating that the starting material must have the opposite stereochemistry, i.e., (S). For reaction B, BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group, and the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicating that the starting material must have the same stereochemistry, i.e., (S). Therefore, the correct choice is A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
