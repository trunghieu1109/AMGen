Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TjbM', content='The LiBH4 reduction proceeds via external hydride attack under chelation control by the acid, delivering hydride opposite the largest β substituent and correlates the acid and product stereochemistries (R acid → R lactone). BH3 reduction proceeds via intramolecular hydride transfer from the boronate, delivering retention of configuration (S acid → S lactone). Thus A must be (R)-acid and B must be (S)-acid, corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
