        "response": "The LiBH4 reduction proceeds via external hydride attack under chelation control by the acid, delivering hydride opposite the largest \u03b2 substituent and correlates the acid and product stereochemistries (R acid \u2192 R lactone). BH3 reduction proceeds via intramolecular hydride transfer from the boronate, delivering retention of configuration (S acid \u2192 S lactone). Thus A must be (R)-acid and B must be (S)-acid, corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
