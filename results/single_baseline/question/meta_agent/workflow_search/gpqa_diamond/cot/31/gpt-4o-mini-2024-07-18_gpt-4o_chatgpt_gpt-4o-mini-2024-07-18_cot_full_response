Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Ge1Q', content='To find the energy of the nucleus X (which is lithium with 3 neutrons, so it is lithium-6), we need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The speed of the nucleus is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The relativistic factor gamma (γ) is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). For v = 0.96c, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714. The rest mass energy of lithium-6 is approximately 6 times the atomic mass unit energy, which is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV. The total energy E is given by E = γ * m_0 * c^2, where m_0 is the rest mass. So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV = 19.964 GeV. The closest choice to this calculated energy is 20.132 GeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
