        "response": "To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 can be calculated using the formula \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Given that v = 0.96c, we can calculate \u03b3 and then find the energy based on the rest mass of the nucleus. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons needs to be determined, and then we can compute the energy. After calculating, we can compare the result with the provided choices to find the closest match.\n\nAnswer:20.132 GeV",
