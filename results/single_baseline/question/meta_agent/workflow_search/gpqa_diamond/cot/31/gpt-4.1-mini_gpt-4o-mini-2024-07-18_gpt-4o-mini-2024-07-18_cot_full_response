Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Ge1Q', content='To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = γmc^2, where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ can be calculated using the formula γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Given that v = 0.96c, we can calculate γ and then find the energy based on the rest mass of the nucleus. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons needs to be determined, and then we can compute the energy. After calculating, we can compare the result with the provided choices to find the closest match.\n\nAnswer:20.132 GeV', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
