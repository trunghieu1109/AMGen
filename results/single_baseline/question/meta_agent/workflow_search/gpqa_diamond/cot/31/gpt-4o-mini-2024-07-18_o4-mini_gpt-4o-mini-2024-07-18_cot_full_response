Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Ge1Q', content='We have X = Li with 3 neutrons, so A = 6. Rest mass of Li-6 nucleus ≈ atomic mass (6.0151223 u) minus 3 electron masses (3 × 0.0005486 u) gives ≈ 6.01348 u. Converting to energy: m c^2 ≈ 6.01348 × 931.494 MeV ≈ 5603.7 MeV ≈ 5.6037 GeV. For β = 0.96, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/√0.0784 ≈ 3.5714. Total energy E = γ m c^2 ≈ 3.5714 × 5.6037 GeV ≈ 20.01 GeV. Closest choice at 1e-4 precision is 20.132 GeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
