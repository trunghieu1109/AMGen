Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have X = Li with 3 neutrons, so A = 6. Rest mass of Li-6 nucleus ≈ atomic mass (6.0151223 u) minus 3 electron masses (3 × 0.0005486 u) gives ≈ 6.01348 u. Converting to energy: m c^2 ≈ 6.01348 × 931.494 MeV ≈ 5603.7 MeV ≈ 5.6037 GeV. For β = 0.96, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/√0.0784 ≈ 3.5714. Total energy E = γ m c^2 ≈ 3.5714 × 5.6037 GeV ≈ 20.01 GeV. Closest choice at 1e-4 precision is 20.132 GeV.
