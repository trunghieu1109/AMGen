Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = γmc^2, where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ can be calculated using the formula γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Given that v = 0.96c, we can calculate γ and then find the energy based on the rest mass of the nucleus. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons needs to be determined, and then we can compute the energy. After calculating, we can compare the result with the provided choices to find the closest match.
