    <pre>To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we need to analyze the transformations step by step. Starting with cyclohexanone, which has 10 hydrogen atoms, the bromination will replace one hydrogen with a bromine atom, leading to a product with 9 hydrogen atoms. The subsequent reaction with sodium hydroxide likely leads to an elimination or substitution that may not significantly change the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. The treatment with thionyl chloride and pyridine typically introduces a chlorine atom, which may also not change the number of distinct hydrogen atoms significantly. Finally, the reduction with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride will reduce any carbonyl or other functional groups, potentially leading to a saturated product. After considering the structure and the transformations, product 4 is likely to have 6 distinct hydrogen atoms due to the saturation and the presence of functional groups. Therefore, the answer is 6.
