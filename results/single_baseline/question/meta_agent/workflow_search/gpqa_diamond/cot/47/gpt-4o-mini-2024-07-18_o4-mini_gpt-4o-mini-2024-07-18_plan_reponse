        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "First, cyclohexanone reacts with Br2 at the \u03b1\u2010position to give 2\u2010bromocyclohexanone.  Heating this \u03b1\u2010bromoketone with NaOH induces a Favorskii rearrangement, contracting the six\u2010membered ring to cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2).  Treating this acid with SOCl2/pyridine converts it to the acid chloride, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (product 3).  Finally, LiAlH(OtBu)3 selectively reduces the acid chloride to the aldehyde, giving cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (product 4).  In cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, analysis of the symmetry (a mirror plane through C1 and C3 of the ring) shows that: 1) the aldehyde proton; 2) the single ring methine proton on C1; 3) the two diastereotopic protons on the \u03b1\u2010CH2 (C2/C5); and 4) the two diastereotopic protons on the \u03b2-CH2 (C3/C4) are all in distinct environments, for a total of 6 chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nAnswer:B)",
