Question: {'question': "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", 'choice1': 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', 'choice2': 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', 'choice3': 'G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', 'choice4': 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent tmsD', content='To analyze the results, we see that g2 has 0% resistance, indicating it is likely a key player in resistance, possibly a transcription factor. The g1 and g3 mutants show some resistance, but the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 show no resistance, suggesting that G2 is essential for resistance. The interaction between G1 and G3 is complex, but since g1g3 has very low resistance, it suggests that G1 may have an epistatic effect over G3. Therefore, the most fitting conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 is epistatic towards G3, indicating that G1 can mask the effect of G3 when G2 is not functional.\n\nAnswer:choice1', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
