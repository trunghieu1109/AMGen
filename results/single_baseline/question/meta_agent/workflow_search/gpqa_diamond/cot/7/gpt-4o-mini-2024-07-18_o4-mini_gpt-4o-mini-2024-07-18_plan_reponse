            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

        "response": "G2 single mutant shows complete loss of resistance (0%), indicating G2 acts upstream (likely a transcription factor) controlling G1 and G3. G1 and G3 single mutants show partial loss (75%, 50%), but the double g1g3 mutant shows a much stronger loss (10%), consistent with functional (partial) redundancy rather than linear pathway; neither single mutant phenotype fully masks the other, so classical epistasis isn\u2019t apparent, but the best matching choice labels G1 and G3 as redundant with G2 as TF.\n\nAnswer:A",
