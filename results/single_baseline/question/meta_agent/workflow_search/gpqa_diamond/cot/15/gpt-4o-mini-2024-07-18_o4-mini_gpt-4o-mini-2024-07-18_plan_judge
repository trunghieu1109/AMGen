Question: Example(question='How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one', choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We count which of the seven compounds is chiral (optically active):
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: sp2 centers only, no chirality → inactive.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)…: two stereocenters with R,S in a non-symmetrical bicyclic framework → active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso form (internal symmetry) → inactive.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,R enantiomer → active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on cyclohexene ring → active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three S stereocenters, no internal symmetry (odd number) → active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no stereocenters (two identical methyl substituents on C3) → inactive.
Thus compounds 2,4,5,6 are optically active: total = 4.
