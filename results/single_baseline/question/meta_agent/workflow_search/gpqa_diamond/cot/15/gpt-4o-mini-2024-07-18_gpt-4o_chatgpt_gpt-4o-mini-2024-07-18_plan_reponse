        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "To determine optical activity, we need to check if each compound has a chiral center and is not a meso compound. \n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound does not have a chiral center as it is a simple alkene with no stereocenters.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers at 3a and 7a, and it is not a meso compound, so it is optically active.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry, so it is not optically active.\n\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has chiral centers and is not meso, so it is optically active.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has a chiral center at the alcohol carbon, so it is optically active.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry, so it is not optically active.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the cyclopentyl group, so it is optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5, and 7 are optically active, so there are 4 optically active compounds.\n\nAnswer:B)",
