Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DQVo', content='We count which of the seven compounds is chiral (optically active):\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: sp2 centers only, no chirality → inactive.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)…: two stereocenters with R,S in a non-symmetrical bicyclic framework → active.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso form (internal symmetry) → inactive.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,R enantiomer → active.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on cyclohexene ring → active.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three S stereocenters, no internal symmetry (odd number) → active.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no stereocenters (two identical methyl substituents on C3) → inactive.\nThus compounds 2,4,5,6 are optically active: total = 4.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
