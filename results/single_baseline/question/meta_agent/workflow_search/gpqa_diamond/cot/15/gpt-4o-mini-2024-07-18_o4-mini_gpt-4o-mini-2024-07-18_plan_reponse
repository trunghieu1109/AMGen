(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)\u2026: two stereocenters with R,S in a non-symmetrical bicyclic framework \u2192 active.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso form (internal symmetry) \u2192 inactive.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,R enantiomer \u2192 active.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on cyclohexene ring \u2192 active.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three S stereocenters, no internal symmetry (odd number) \u2192 active.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no stereocenters (two identical methyl substituents on C3) \u2192 inactive.\nThus compounds 2,4,5,6 are optically active: total = 4.\n\nAnswer:B)",
