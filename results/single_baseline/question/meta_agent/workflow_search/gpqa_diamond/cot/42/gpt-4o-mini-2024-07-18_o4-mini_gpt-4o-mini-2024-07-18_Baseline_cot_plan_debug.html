    <pre>We have a benzene with –COOH as principal (C1), and substituents at C2,3,4,5,6. Carbaldehyde (CHO), cyano (CN), and –COOH are all meta to one another, so CHO and CN occupy C3 and C5. Para to –COOH (C4) is OMe. Ortho to –COOH (C2 and C6) are OH and NMe2. The methoxy at C4 and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile, so CN must be at C5, making OH at C6 and NMe2 at C2. Thus the substituents are at 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy. IUPAC dictates listing substituents alphabetically: cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M), giving 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which is choice A).
