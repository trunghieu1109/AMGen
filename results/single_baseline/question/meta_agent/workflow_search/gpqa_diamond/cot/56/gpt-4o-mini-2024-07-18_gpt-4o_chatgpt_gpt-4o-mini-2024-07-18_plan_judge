proposed answer: To find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts: \( \text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \). Given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), we convert these to radians: \( \delta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}, \delta_1 = \frac{67\pi}{180}, \delta_2 = \frac{55\pi}{180}, \delta_3 = \frac{30\pi}{180}, \delta_4 = \frac{13\pi}{180} \). The wave number \( k \) is related to the energy by \( k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} \). For electrons, \( m \approx 0.511 \text{ MeV/c}^2 \), and \( E = 50 \text{ MeV} \). We calculate \( k \) and then \( \text{Im} f(0) \) using the given phase shifts.
