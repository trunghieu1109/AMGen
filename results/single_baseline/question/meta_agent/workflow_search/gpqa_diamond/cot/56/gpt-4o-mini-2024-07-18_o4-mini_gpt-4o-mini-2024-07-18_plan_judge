Question: Example(question='Given the measured phase shifts $\\delta_o=90^o, \\delta_1=67^o, \\delta_2=55, \\delta_3=30^o$ and $\\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. ', choice1='177.675 fm\n', choice2='87163.4 fm\n', choice3='251.271 fm\n', choice4='355.351 fm', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We want the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude: f(0)=1/(k)∑(2l+1)sin^2δl. With δ0–δ4 given, compute S=∑(2l+1)sin^2δl≈9.10245. For 50 MeV electrons treated nonrelativistically, p=√(2mE)≈7.15 MeV/c, k=p/ħc≈7.15/197.3≈0.0363 fm⁻¹. Then Im f(0)=S/k≈9.10245/0.0363≈250.7 fm ≃251.271 fm.
