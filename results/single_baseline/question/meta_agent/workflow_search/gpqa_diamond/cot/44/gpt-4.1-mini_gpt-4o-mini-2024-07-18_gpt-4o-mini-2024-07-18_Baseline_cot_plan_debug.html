    <pre>To find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle and how the particles fill the available energy levels. The energy levels for a single particle in a well are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For four spin-1/2 particles, we will fill the lowest energy states first. The ground state will have the first two particles in the lowest state (n=1) and the next two in the second state (n=2). The energies will be calculated as follows: Ground state energy = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 10E. The first excited state will involve one of the particles moving to the next available state, leading to a total energy of 15E. The second excited state will involve further excitation, leading to a total energy of 18E. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that matches these calculated energies.
