Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have 4 spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Single-particle energies are E_n=n^2E with E=π^2ħ^2/(2mL^2), and each n-level holds max 2 electrons (spin up/down). Ground state: fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2): total energy =2·1^2E+2·2^2E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3: levels 1,1,2,3:2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=15E. Second excited: next minimal configuration is 1,2,2,3:1^2E+2·2^2E+3^2E=18E. Thus energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, matching choice2.
