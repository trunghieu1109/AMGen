Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent F775', content='We have 4 spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Single-particle energies are E_n=n^2E with E=π^2ħ^2/(2mL^2), and each n-level holds max 2 electrons (spin up/down). Ground state: fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2): total energy =2·1^2E+2·2^2E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3: levels 1,1,2,3:2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=15E. Second excited: next minimal configuration is 1,2,2,3:1^2E+2·2^2E+3^2E=18E. Thus energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, matching choice2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
