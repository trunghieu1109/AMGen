        "response": "We have 4 spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Single-particle energies are E_n=n^2E with E=\u03c0^2\u0127^2/(2mL^2), and each n-level holds max 2 electrons (spin up/down). Ground state: fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2): total energy =2\u00b71^2E+2\u00b72^2E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3: levels 1,1,2,3:2\u00b71^2E+1\u00b72^2E+1\u00b73^2E=15E. Second excited: next minimal configuration is 1,2,2,3:1^2E+2\u00b72^2E+3^2E=18E. Thus energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, matching choice2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
