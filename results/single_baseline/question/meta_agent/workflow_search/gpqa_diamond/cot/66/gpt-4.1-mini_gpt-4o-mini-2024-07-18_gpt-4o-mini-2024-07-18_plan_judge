Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the given state |1,1,2,-1>, the quantum numbers l1 and l2 are both 1, which means that each electron can have the eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ, 0, or +ħ. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron in a p orbital (l=1) are -ħ, 0, and +ħ. The joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ can be calculated by considering the coefficients of the state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the basis states |1, -1> for both electrons. The state |1,1,2,-1> corresponds to a total m = -1, which can be achieved by the combinations of m values of the individual electrons. The only way to achieve m = -1 is if both electrons are in the state with m = -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is 1, since the state |1,1,2,-1> is fully aligned with both electrons having m = -1.
