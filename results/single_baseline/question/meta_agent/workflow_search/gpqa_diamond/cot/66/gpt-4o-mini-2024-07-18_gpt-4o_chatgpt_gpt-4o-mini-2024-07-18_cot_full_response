Question: {'question': 'Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', 'choice1': '1', 'choice2': '1/2', 'choice3': '0', 'choice4': '2/3'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1hOh', content='We have two electrons in a p orbital, each with l_1 = l_2 = 1. The total angular momentum state is |1, 1, 2, -1>. We want to find the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ. The state |1, 1, 2, -1> is a linear combination of product states |m_1, m_2> where m_1 + m_2 = -1. The possible combinations are |0, -1> and |-1, 0>. The state |1, 1, 2, -1> is specifically a linear combination of these states, but it does not include |-1, -1> because m_1 + m_2 = -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
