    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>In the given state |1,1,2,-1&gt;, the quantum numbers l1 and l2 are both 1, which means that each electron can have the eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ, 0, or +ħ. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron in a p orbital (l=1) are -ħ, 0, and +ħ. The joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ can be calculated by considering the coefficients of the state |1,1,2,-1&gt; in terms of the basis states |1, -1&gt; for both electrons. The state |1,1,2,-1&gt; corresponds to a total m = -1, which can be achieved by the combinations of m values of the individual electrons. The only way to achieve m = -1 is if both electrons are in the state with m = -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is 1, since the state |1,1,2,-1&gt; is fully aligned with both electrons having m = -1.
