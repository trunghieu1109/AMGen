Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cxjH', content='Given Δx=0.1\u2009nm, use Heisenberg: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). ħ≈1.05×10⁻³⁴\u2009J·s, so Δp≈1.05×10⁻³⁴/(2×1×10⁻¹⁰)≈5.27×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s. Energy uncertainty ΔE≈v·Δp with v=2×10⁸\u2009m/s gives ΔE≈(2×10⁸)(5.27×10⁻²⁵)≈1.05×10⁻¹⁶\u2009J, i.e. ~10⁻¹⁶\u2009J.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
