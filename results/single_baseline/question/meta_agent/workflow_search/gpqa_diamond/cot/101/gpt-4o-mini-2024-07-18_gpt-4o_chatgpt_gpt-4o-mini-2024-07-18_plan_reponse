            "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?",
            "ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship",
            "the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame",
            "the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing",
            "the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The construct is designed to express the ligand and receptor in a Cre-dependent manner. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The presence of loxP and lox2272 sites suggests that Cre recombinase will remove the stop cassettes, allowing expression of the fluorescent proteins. The SOX10-Cre mice should express Cre in neural crest derivatives, leading to expression of mCherry and eGFP in those cells. The lack of green signal suggests an issue with receptor-eGFP expression. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP will not be expressed correctly, leading to no green fluorescence. The other options do not directly explain the lack of green signal: paracrine signaling does not affect fluorescence, missing enhancer would affect both mCherry and eGFP, and Golgi retention would still allow some fluorescence.\n\nAnswer:B)",
