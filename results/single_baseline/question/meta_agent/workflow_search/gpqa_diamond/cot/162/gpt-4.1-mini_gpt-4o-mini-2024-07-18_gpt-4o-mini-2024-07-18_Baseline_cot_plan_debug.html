    <pre>To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, we need to neutralize it with a strong acid. The reaction will consume an equivalent amount of strong acid. To find the volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed, we can use the formula: Volume (L) = moles / concentration. The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, so we need 0.000935 moles of acid, which corresponds to a volume of 0.000935 moles / 0.1 M = 0.00935 L or 9.35 cm3. However, we also need to consider the total volume of the solution and the resulting pH after the acid is added. The pH can be calculated based on the concentration of H+ ions after the acid is added to the solution. After calculating the pH for each option, we find that the correct answer matches choice 2, which gives a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm3 of the strong acid.

Answer:pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3</pre>
