Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent edw3', content='Calculate moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g/106.85 g·mol⁻¹≈9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. It consumes 3 mol H+ per mol, so need 2.81×10⁻³ mol H+. At 0.1 M acid, V=2.81×10⁻³/0.1=0.0281 L≈28.1 mL. After reaction Fe3+ is 9.36×10⁻³ M; to avoid precipitation, [OH⁻] must satisfy Ksp=[Fe3+][OH⁻]³, giving [OH⁻]≈1.6×10⁻12 M, so pOH≈11.8 and pH≈2.04.
