Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Calculate moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g/106.85 g·mol⁻¹≈9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. It consumes 3 mol H+ per mol, so need 2.81×10⁻³ mol H+. At 0.1 M acid, V=2.81×10⁻³/0.1=0.0281 L≈28.1 mL. After reaction Fe3+ is 9.36×10⁻³ M; to avoid precipitation, [OH⁻] must satisfy Ksp=[Fe3+][OH⁻]³, giving [OH⁻]≈1.6×10⁻12 M, so pOH≈11.8 and pH≈2.04. Matches choice 1.
