Question: {'question': 'Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', 'choice1': '29', 'choice2': '25', 'choice3': '35', 'choice4': '31'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rPKz', content='To solve the problem, we need to identify Substance X and its elements based on the clues provided. The mention of a heavier isotope suggests that Substance X could be a compound containing elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen, which are common in organic chemistry. The gas W that has the same number of neutrons and protons indicates it could be a simple molecule like H2 or He, which has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. The precipitate G and the substance B with a melting point close to 277 K could suggest a specific compound. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X need to be calculated. After analyzing the choices, the most plausible cumulative atomic mass based on common elements in organic chemistry and the clues provided leads to the conclusion that the answer is 31, which corresponds to the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
