    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X and its constituent elements. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements and reacts with liquid Y to release gas W and precipitate G. Gas W has molecules with equal numbers of neutrons and protons, suggesting it could be diatomic hydrogen (H2) or another element with equal protons and neutrons. Precipitate G releases B upon heating, and B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is around 4Â°C, suggesting B could be water (H2O). The reaction of a keto acid with Substance X produces a compound with 2 oxygen atoms, suggesting Substance X could be a halogen or a similar reactive element. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, hinting it could be a halogen like chlorine or bromine. Considering these clues, Substance X could be a halogen compound like Cl2 or Br2. The lightest element in Cl2 is chlorine with isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl, and the heaviest element is also chlorine. The cumulative atomic mass of chlorine isotopes is 35 + 37 = 72. However, if we consider Br2, the isotopes are 79Br and 81Br, with a cumulative mass of 79 + 81 = 160. The problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. If we assume Substance X is Cl2, the cumulative mass is 72. If it is Br2, the cumulative mass is 160. However, the choices given are 29, 25, 35, and 31. None of these match 72 or 160 directly. If we consider the possibility of a different interpretation, such as a compound with multiple elements, we might need to consider other combinations. However, based on the given choices and typical reagents, the closest match might be 35, assuming a different interpretation of the elements involved.
