Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We recognize that Substance X incorporates the heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium) and is a close analog of LiAlH4, namely LiAlD4. Reaction with water (liquid Y) releases D2 gas (equal neutrons and protons), precipitates Al(OD)3 (G), which on heating yields D2O (B) melting at ≈277 K. Substance X is LiAlD4, containing Li, Al, and four D atoms. The lightest element present is H (here as deuterium), with four D atoms totalling mass ≈4×2=8, and the heaviest element is Al (mass ≈27). The sum is 8+27=35.
