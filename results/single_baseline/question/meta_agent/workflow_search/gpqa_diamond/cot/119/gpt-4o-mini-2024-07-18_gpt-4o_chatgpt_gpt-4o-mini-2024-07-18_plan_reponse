        "response": "If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4\u03c0r^2 dr. The parallax plx is inversely proportional to the distance r (plx = 1/r for simplicity, assuming units where this holds). Therefore, dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Substituting this into the volume expression, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 4\u03c0(1/plx^2)^2 (-1/plx^2 d(plx)) = 4\u03c0/plx^4 d(plx). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~ 1/plx^4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
