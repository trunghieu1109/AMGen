Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2 dr. The parallax plx is inversely proportional to the distance r (plx = 1/r for simplicity, assuming units where this holds). Therefore, dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Substituting this into the volume expression, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 4π(1/plx^2)^2 (-1/plx^2 d(plx)) = 4π/plx^4 d(plx). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~ 1/plx^4.
