Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance of the stars. As the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and thus the volume of space that corresponds to that parallax range decreases. The volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of the radius (which is related to distance). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is expected to decrease with the cube of the parallax, leading to the relationship ~ 1/plx^3.
