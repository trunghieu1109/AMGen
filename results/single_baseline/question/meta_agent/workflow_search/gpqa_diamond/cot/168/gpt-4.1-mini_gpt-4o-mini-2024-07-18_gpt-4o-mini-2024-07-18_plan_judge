Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E. When one massless particle M is emitted instead of the two particles V, the energy available for the outgoing particles E changes. Since M is massless, it does not take up any rest mass energy, but the overall energy conservation must still hold. The total energy available for the outgoing particles E will be less than in the original decay because the energy that would have gone into the two V particles is now replaced by the massless particle M. Therefore, the spectrum of the outgoing E particles will remain continuous, but the endpoint will decrease due to the change in energy distribution. Thus, the correct choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.
