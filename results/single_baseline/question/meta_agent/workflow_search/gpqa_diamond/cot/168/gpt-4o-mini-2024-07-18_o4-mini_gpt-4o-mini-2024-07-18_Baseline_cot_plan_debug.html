    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;}

    <pre>We have an original four-body decay 2A→2B+2E+2V whose summed electron energy spectrum is continuous from 0 to Q. Replacing two neutrinos by one massless exotic M yields a three-body decay 2A→2B+2E+M. Three-body decays also give continuous electron sum spectra. The kinematic endpoint is when M carries zero energy, so the maximum summed electron energy remains Q (unchanged). The spectral shape is altered by the different available phase space but the endpoint is the same.

Answer:The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint remains at Q (unchanged).</pre>
