Question: Example(question='A compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and the given NMR data is reacted with the following set of reagents:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl\n2. H2O\n3. aq. KOH, Heat \n\n1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Identify the final product.', choice1='4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal', choice2='3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal', choice3='2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal', choice4='2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The compound C8H9NO with the given NMR data suggests a structure with an aldehyde group (9.72 ppm, t, 1H) and aromatic protons (6.98 ppm, d, 2H and 6.51 ppm, d, 2H). The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) signal could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom or group. The reaction sequence involves diazotization (NaNO2 + HCl), hydrolysis (H2O), and heating with KOH, which suggests the formation of a phenol from an aromatic amine. The final product is likely a phenolic aldehyde. The choice that matches this description is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.
