        "response": "The molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H NMR data: an aldehyde at 9.72 ppm (t, J\u22485.9 Hz, CHO coupling to CH2), CH2 at 3.66 ppm (d, J\u22485.9 Hz), two aromatic doublets (2H each) and a broad 2H singlet at 6.27 ppm (NH2). This corresponds to 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (p-amino\u2013CH2\u2013CHO). NaNO2/HCl converts the NH2 to a diazonium, H2O gives the p-hydroxy derivative, then base/heat induces self-aldol condensation of p-hydroxybenzeneacetaldehyde to yield the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.\n\nAnswer:A)",
