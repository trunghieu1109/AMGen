    <pre>To identify the final product after the reactions, we need to analyze the starting compound and the reagents used. The molecular formula C8H9NO suggests a compound with a nitrogen atom, likely an amine or an amide. The NMR data indicates the presence of aromatic protons and possibly an aldehyde or ketone. The first step with NaNO2 and HCl suggests a diazotization reaction, which typically converts primary amines to diazonium salts. The subsequent reaction with water would lead to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, likely forming a phenol. The final step with KOH and heat suggests a condensation or elimination reaction, possibly leading to the formation of an enal or an alkene. Analyzing the choices, we look for a product that fits the expected structure after these transformations. The choice that best fits the expected product is &#39;2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal&#39;, as it suggests a compound with two phenolic groups and an enal structure, which aligns with the transformations described.
