        "response": "The IR shows two N\u2013H stretches (3420, 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating a primary amine and an ester (not an amide, which absorbs lower). The \u00b9H NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), characteristic of an ethyl ester (OCH\u2082 at ~4.5). A propionate CH\u2082 would appear around 2.3 ppm, and an amide\u2019s ethoxy N\u2013CH\u2082 would differ. The aromatic pattern is an AA\u2032BB\u2032 (7.0 and 8.0 ppm), consistent with para substitution. Thus the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
