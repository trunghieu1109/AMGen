Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR shows two N–H stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a primary amine and an ester (not an amide, which absorbs lower). The ¹H NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), characteristic of an ethyl ester (OCH₂ at ~4.5). A propionate CH₂ would appear around 2.3 ppm, and an amide’s ethoxy N–CH₂ would differ. The aromatic pattern is an AA′BB′ (7.0 and 8.0 ppm), consistent with para substitution. Thus the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, choice D).
