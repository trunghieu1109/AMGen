Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows bands indicative of hydroxyl (OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups. The NMR data suggests the presence of ethyl groups and aromatic protons. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns in the NMR help to deduce the structure. The presence of a strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide. The integration of the NMR signals indicates the presence of an ethyl group and an aromatic system. Among the choices, 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' fits the molecular formula and the spectral data best, as it contains an ethyl group, an amine, and a carbonyl group consistent with the IR and NMR data.
