Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent nqck', content='The IR shows two N–H stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a primary amine and an ester (not an amide, which absorbs lower). The ¹H NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), characteristic of an ethyl ester (OCH₂ at ~4.5). A propionate CH₂ would appear around 2.3 ppm, and an amide’s ethoxy N–CH₂ would differ. The aromatic pattern is an AA′BB′ (7.0 and 8.0 ppm), consistent with para substitution. Thus the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
