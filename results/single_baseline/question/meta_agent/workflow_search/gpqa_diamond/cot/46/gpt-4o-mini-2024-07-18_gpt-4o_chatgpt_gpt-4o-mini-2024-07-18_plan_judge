Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals at 1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H), which are characteristic of an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-). The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be an NH2 group. The signals at 7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Considering these data, the compound is likely to be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which matches the IR and NMR data.
