        "response": "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, we need to use the spin state of the electron and the spin operator for S_y, which is represented by the matrix sigma_y. The spin state (3i, 4) can be normalized and then we can calculate the expectation value using the formula <S_y> = <\u03c8|S_y|\u03c8>. We will compute this step by step.\n\nAnswer:The expectation value of the spin along y-direction, S_y, is -12*hbar/25.",
