    <pre>The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroidal, which suggests that the radiation pattern will be anisotropic. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function of the wavelength \lambda and the angle \theta. The maximum power is radiated along the symmetry axis (\theta = 0), and we need to find the fraction of this maximum power radiated at \theta = 30^0. For a dipole-like radiation pattern, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(\theta). At \theta = 30^0, sin^2(30^0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at \theta = 30^0 is 1/4. The form of f(\lambda, \theta) is likely related to the wavelength dependence of the radiation, which for dipole radiation is typically \lambda^(-4).
