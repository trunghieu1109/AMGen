            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "We have an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution along the z-axis that behaves like an electric dipole. The radiated power per solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2\u03b8 and \u03c9^4 (with \u03c9=2\u03c0c/\u03bb \u21d2 \u03c9^4\u221d\u03bb^(\u22124)). The maximum occurs at \u03b8=90\u00b0, so f(\u03b8)=A\u2009sin^2\u03b8. At \u03b8=30\u00b0, sin^2(30\u00b0)=1/4. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is \u03bb^(\u22124), corresponding to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
