In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroidal, which suggests that the radiation pattern will be anisotropic. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function of the wavelength \\lambda and the angle \\theta. The maximum power is radiated along the symmetry axis (\\theta = 0), and we need to find the fraction of this maximum power radiated at \\theta = 30^0. For a dipole-like radiation pattern, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(\\theta). At \\theta = 30^0, sin^2(30^0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at \\theta = 30^0 is 1/4. The form of f(\\lambda, \\theta) is likely related to the wavelength dependence of the radiation, which for dipole radiation is typically \\lambda^(-4).\n\nAnswer:C)",
