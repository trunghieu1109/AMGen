Question: {'question': 'Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', 'choice1': '1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice2': '3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', 'choice3': '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice4': '1/4, \\lambda^(-3)'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent p2M6', content='We have an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution along the z-axis that behaves like an electric dipole. The radiated power per solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2θ and ω^4 (with ω=2πc/λ ⇒ ω^4∝λ^(−4)). The maximum occurs at θ=90°, so f(θ)=A\u2009sin^2θ. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ^(−4), corresponding to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
