Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution along the z-axis that behaves like an electric dipole. The radiated power per solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2θ and ω^4 (with ω=2πc/λ ⇒ ω^4∝λ^(−4)). The maximum occurs at θ=90°, so f(θ)=A sin^2θ. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4. Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ^(−4), corresponding to choice 3.
