            "You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?",

        "response": "The experiment delivers GFP-tagged rotavirus capsid proteins orally, some being degraded, others trapped in mucus, then uptake by Peyer patches brings antigen to B cells. Isolation of proliferating cells from Peyer patches and sequencing of their variable heavy chain shows high variability, indicating point mutations in the V region for affinity maturation. This is characteristic of somatic hypermutation during germinal center reactions.\n\nAnswer:A)",
