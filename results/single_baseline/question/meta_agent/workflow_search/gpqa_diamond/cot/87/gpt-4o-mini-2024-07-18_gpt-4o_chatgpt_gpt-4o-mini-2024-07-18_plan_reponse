            "You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?",

        "response": "The question describes a scenario where inner capsid proteins of rotavirus tagged with GFP are delivered to mice, and fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. The proliferating cell population in Peyer's patches shows high variability in their variable heavy chain gene sequences. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are involved in the immune response. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests a process that introduces diversity in the antibody genes. Somatic hypermutation is a process that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes, leading to increased diversity and affinity maturation. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not involve gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the constant region of the antibody but not the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development to initially create diverse antibodies, but the question suggests ongoing variability, which is characteristic of somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.\n\nAnswer:A)",
