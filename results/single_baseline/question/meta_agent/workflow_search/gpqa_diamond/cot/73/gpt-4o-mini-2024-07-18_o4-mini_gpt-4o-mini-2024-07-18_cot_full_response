Question: {'question': 'We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', 'choice1': '52%', 'choice2': '48%', 'choice3': '44%', 'choice4': '40%'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FeVW', content='We assume exponential decay (memoryless process). Given decay probability within 100 min is 0.32, so 1–e^(−λ·100)=0.32 ⇒ e^(−100λ)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.0038566 min⁻¹. Memoryless property implies probability of decay in next 150 min is 1–e^(−λ·150)=1–e^(−0.5785)≈1–0.5605=0.4395≈44%.\n\nAnswer:C', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
