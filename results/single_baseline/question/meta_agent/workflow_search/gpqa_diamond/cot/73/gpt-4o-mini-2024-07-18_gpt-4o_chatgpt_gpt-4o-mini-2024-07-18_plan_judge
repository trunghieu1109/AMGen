Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are dealing with a memoryless process, which is characteristic of exponential decay. The probability of decay in a given time interval is independent of how much time has already passed without decay. We know the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which means the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%. We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The total time we are considering is 200 minutes (50 minutes have passed, and we are considering the next 150 minutes). The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is (0.68)^(200/100) = 0.68^2. Therefore, the probability of decaying in 200 minutes is 1 - 0.68^2. However, we need the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The probability of not decaying in 50 minutes is (0.68)^(50/100) = sqrt(0.68). The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is 0.68^2. The probability of not decaying in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is 0.68^2 / sqrt(0.68). Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - (0.68^2 / sqrt(0.68)).
