Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We assume exponential decay (memoryless process). Given decay probability within 100 min is 0.32, so 1–e^(−λ·100)=0.32 ⇒ e^(−100λ)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.0038566 min⁻¹. Memoryless property implies probability of decay in next 150 min is 1–e^(−λ·150)=1–e^(−0.5785)≈1–0.5605=0.4395≈44%.
