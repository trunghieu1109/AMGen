Question: {'question': 'We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VWWJ', content='The decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes, which means the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%. After 50 minutes, the atom has not decayed, so we need to find the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it has survived the first 50 minutes. We can use the exponential decay model to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The decay constant can be derived from the 100-minute decay probability. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes can be calculated using the survival probability from the first 50 minutes and the decay probability for the next 150 minutes. After calculations, we find that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 52%.\n\nAnswer:A', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
