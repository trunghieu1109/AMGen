    <pre>To determine the ratio of the flux of neutrinos in the two energy bands (700-800 KeV and 800-900 KeV) after stopping the pp-III branch, we need to consider the characteristics of neutrino production in the Sun. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos primarily in the energy range of 800-900 KeV. Stopping this branch would significantly reduce the flux of neutrinos in this energy range while having a lesser effect on the lower energy range (700-800 KeV). Therefore, the flux in band 1 (700-800 KeV) would remain relatively stable, while the flux in band 2 (800-900 KeV) would decrease. This suggests that the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) would be greater than 1, as band 1 would have a higher flux compared to band 2 after the pp-III branch is stopped. Among the choices provided, the most reasonable estimate for this ratio is 10, indicating that the flux in the lower energy band is significantly higher than in the higher energy band after the pp-III branch stops producing neutrinos.
