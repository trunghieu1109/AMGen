            "Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It\u2019s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)",
