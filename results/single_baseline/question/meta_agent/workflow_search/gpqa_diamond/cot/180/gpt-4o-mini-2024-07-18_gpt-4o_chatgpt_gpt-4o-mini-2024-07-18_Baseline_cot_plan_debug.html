    <pre>The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces high-energy neutrinos, particularly from the decay of Beryllium-8 and Boron-8. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch are typically higher in energy compared to those from the pp-I and pp-II branches. If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, the flux of high-energy neutrinos (such as those in the 800-900 keV range) would decrease significantly, while the flux of lower-energy neutrinos (such as those in the 700-800 keV range) would be less affected, as they are more likely to come from the pp-I and pp-II branches. Therefore, the ratio of the flux in the 700-800 keV band to the 800-900 keV band would increase, as the 800-900 keV band would see a larger relative decrease in neutrino flux.
