            "Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other.

        "response": "The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces high-energy neutrinos, particularly from the decay of Beryllium-8 and Boron-8. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch are typically higher in energy compared to those from the pp-I and pp-II branches. If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, the flux of high-energy neutrinos (such as those in the 800-900 keV range) would decrease significantly, while the flux of lower-energy neutrinos (such as those in the 700-800 keV range) would be less affected, as they are more likely to come from the pp-I and pp-II branches. Therefore, the ratio of the flux in the 700-800 keV band to the 800-900 keV band would increase, as the 800-900 keV band would see a larger relative decrease in neutrino flux.\n\nAnswer:10.",
