            "reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?",

        "response": "To determine the molecular symmetry group of product E, we need to analyze the information given about the reactions and the nature of the products. The symmetry group can often be inferred from the structure of the molecule, which is not explicitly provided here. However, we can make educated guesses based on common molecular symmetry groups. The options provided are C2, C2v, D4h, and D\u221eh. D\u221eh is typically associated with linear molecules with infinite symmetry, while D4h is associated with square planar molecules. C2 and C2v are simpler groups. Without specific structural information about E, it is challenging to definitively choose the correct symmetry group. However, D4h is a more complex symmetry group that might be associated with a more intricate structure, while C2 and C2v are simpler. Given the hazardous nature of E, it might suggest a more complex structure, leading to the choice of D4h as a potential symmetry group.\n\nAnswer:D4h",
