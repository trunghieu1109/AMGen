Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the molecular symmetry group of E, we need to deduce the identities of the compounds involved. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. This suggests a metal reacting with a diatomic gas, possibly a halogen, to form a metal halide. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it forms hazardous product E. C reacting with water to reform A and two acids, one strong and one weak, suggests C is a metal halide, A is a metal, and the acids are likely HCl (strong) and HOCl (weak), indicating C is a metal chloride. D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent, suggests D is a gas like O2 or Cl2, and B is likely Cl2. If D is O2, then E could be a metal oxide. A common hazardous metal oxide is Cl2O7, which has D∞h symmetry. Therefore, E is likely Cl2O7.

Answer:D∞h
Extracted answer: D∞h
Correct answer: 2
