Question: {'question': 'reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', 'choice1': 'C2', 'choice2': 'C2v', 'choice3': 'D4h', 'choice4': 'D∞h'}\Pattern: cot
