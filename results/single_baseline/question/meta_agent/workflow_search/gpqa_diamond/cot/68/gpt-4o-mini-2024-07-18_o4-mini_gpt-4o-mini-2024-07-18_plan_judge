Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Compute the Lorentz factor γ = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≃ 7.92.  
Step 2: Compute the mean decay length in the lab frame Ld = γ c τ0 = 7.92 × (3×10^8 m/s) × 8×10^-16 s ≃ 2.08×10^-6 m.  
Step 3: To see a fraction P = 30% of decays within a resolution ℓ, we need 1 – exp(–ℓ/Ld) = 0.3 ⇒ ℓ = –Ld ln 0.7 ≃ 0.36 Ld ≃ 7.5×10^-7 m.  
Step 4: The closest available resolution on the list is of order 10^-6 m, namely 2.08×10^-6 m.
