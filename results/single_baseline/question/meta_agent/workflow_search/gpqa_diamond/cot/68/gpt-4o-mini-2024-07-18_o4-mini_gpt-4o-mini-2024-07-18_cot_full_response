Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent PROn', content='Step 1: Compute the Lorentz factor γ = E/m = 27\u2009GeV / 3.41\u2009GeV ≃ 7.92.  \nStep 2: Compute the mean decay length in the lab frame Ld = γ c τ0 = 7.92 × (3×10^8\u2009m/s) × 8×10^-16\u2009s ≃ 2.08×10^-6\u2009m.  \nStep 3: To see a fraction P = 30% of decays within a resolution ℓ, we need 1 – exp(–ℓ/Ld) = 0.3 ⇒ ℓ = –Ld\u2009ln\u20090.7 ≃ 0.36\u2009Ld ≃ 7.5×10^-7\u2009m.  \nStep 4: The closest available resolution on the list is of order 10^-6\u2009m, namely 2.08×10^-6\u2009m.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
