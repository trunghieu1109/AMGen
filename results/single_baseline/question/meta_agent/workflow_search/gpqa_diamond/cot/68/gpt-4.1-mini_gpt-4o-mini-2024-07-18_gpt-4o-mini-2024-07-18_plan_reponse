        "response": "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^{0}, we need to calculate the distance the particle travels during its proper lifetime. The speed of the particle can be calculated using its energy and mass. The total energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m of X^{0} is 3.41 GeV. We can use the relation E = mc^2 to find the speed. The proper lifetime \u03c4_0 is given as 8 \u00d7 10^{-16} s. The distance traveled by the particle in this time can be calculated using the speed and the lifetime. The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays will be related to this distance. After performing the calculations, we can compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:2.08*1e-6 m",
