        "response": "To find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the particle X^0 before it decays. The proper lifetime \\tau_0 is given as 8 \\times 10^{-16} s. The energy of the particle is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. First, we calculate the Lorentz factor \\gamma = E/m = 27/3.41. Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0. The distance traveled is d = c \\tau, where c is the speed of light. We want to find the distance such that at least 30% of the particles decay, which corresponds to 1 - e^{-d/(c \\tau_0)} = 0.3. Solving for d gives d = -c \\tau_0 \\ln(0.7).\n\nAnswer:C)",
