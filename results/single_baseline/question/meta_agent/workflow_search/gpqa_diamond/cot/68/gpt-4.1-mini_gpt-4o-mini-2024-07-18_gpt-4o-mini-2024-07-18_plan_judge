What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^{0}, we need to calculate the distance the particle travels during its proper lifetime. The speed of the particle can be calculated using its energy and mass. The total energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m of X^{0} is 3.41 GeV. We can use the relation E = mc^2 to find the speed. The proper lifetime τ_0 is given as 8 × 10^{-16} s. The distance traveled by the particle in this time can be calculated using the speed and the lifetime. The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays will be related to this distance. After performing the calculations, we can compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct answer.
