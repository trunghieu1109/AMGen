        "response": "First reaction: KH deprotonates the spiro\u2010alcohol to give an alkoxide that does a conjugate (Michael-type) intramolecular attack on the vinyl double bond, giving a bicyclo[5.3.1]undec\u20101(11)\u2010en\u20104\u2010ol intermediate that tautomerizes on workup to the corresponding enone. That is the (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one.\n\nSecond reaction: LDA deprotonates the allylic alcohol, then O-acylation with acetyl bromide gives an allylic acetate which under the basic conditions undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic (Ireland-Claisen) rearrangement and remains as the lithium carboxylate salt\u2014lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate. Hence the correct choice is A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate.\n\nAnswer:B",
