The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. We will substitute these values into the equations provided and perform the necessary calculations to find the value of nG. After performing the calculations, we will compare the result with the provided choices to determine the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:1.38",
