Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kMOa', content='The relative-entropy non-Gaussianity for a Schrödinger cat state grows with the cat amplitude. For small amplitude α=0.5 and φ=−π/4 one finds a small non-Gaussianity. Of the given options (2.48, 0, 1.38, 0.25), only 0.25 is consistent with known results for a low-amplitude cat state.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
