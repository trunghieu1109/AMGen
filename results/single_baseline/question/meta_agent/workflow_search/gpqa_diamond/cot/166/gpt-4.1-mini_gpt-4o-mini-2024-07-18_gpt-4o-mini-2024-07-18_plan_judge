Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we need to evaluate the density matrices rho and tau, and then compute the relative entropy del_b. The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. We will substitute these values into the equations provided and perform the necessary calculations to find the value of nG. After performing the calculations, we will compare the result with the provided choices to determine the correct answer.
