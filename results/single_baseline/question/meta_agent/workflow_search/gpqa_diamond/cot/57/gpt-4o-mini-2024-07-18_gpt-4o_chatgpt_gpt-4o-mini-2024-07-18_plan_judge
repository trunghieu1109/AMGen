Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that require regularization. Superstring Theory is a theoretical framework that aims to unify all fundamental forces and is believed to be finite, thus not requiring regularization in the same way as QED or QCD. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not encounter the same high-energy infinities as quantum theories and does not require regularization. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is Classical Electrodynamics.
