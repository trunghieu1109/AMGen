Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Regularization is needed to handle ultraviolet divergences in a theoryâ€™s high-energy behavior. Quantum Electrodynamics (choice B) and Quantum Chromodynamics (choice C) are quantum field theories with UV divergences requiring regularization and renormalization. Classical Electrodynamics (choice D) has issues like infinite self-energy of point charges and is not a UV-complete theory. Superstring Theory (choice A) is constructed to be finite and free of UV divergences, so it does not require regularization at high energies.
