Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we need to analyze each option. Superstring Theory is a high-energy theory that often requires regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) does require regularization due to divergences at high energies. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) also has issues with divergences and requires regularization. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory and does not have the same issues with high-energy divergences as quantum theories do. Therefore, the answer is Classical Electrodynamics.
