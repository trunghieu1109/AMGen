        "response": "Regularization is needed to handle ultraviolet divergences in a theory\u2019s high-energy behavior. Quantum Electrodynamics (choice B) and Quantum Chromodynamics (choice C) are quantum field theories with UV divergences requiring regularization and renormalization. Classical Electrodynamics (choice D) has issues like infinite self-energy of point charges and is not a UV-complete theory. Superstring Theory (choice A) is constructed to be finite and free of UV divergences, so it does not require regularization at high energies.\n\nAnswer:A)",
