Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and a reagent A. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acidic workup to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, so A is likely an acid such as H3O+. The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which can be done using an acid such as HCl. Therefore, the suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl.
