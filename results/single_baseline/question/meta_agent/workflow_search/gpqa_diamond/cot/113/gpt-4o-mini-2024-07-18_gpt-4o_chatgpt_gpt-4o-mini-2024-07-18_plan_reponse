        "response": "The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and a reagent A. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acidic workup to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, so A is likely an acid such as H3O+. The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which can be done using an acid such as HCl. Therefore, the suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\nAnswer:D)",
