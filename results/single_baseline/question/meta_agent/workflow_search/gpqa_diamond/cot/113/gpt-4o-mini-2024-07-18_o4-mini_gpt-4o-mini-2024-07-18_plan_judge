Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First step is cyanohydrin formation: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN under acidic conditions to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Acid is required to protonate the alkoxide intermediate and to generate HCN in situ, so A must be H3O+, not NaHSO3 (bisulfite gives bisulfite adducts, not cyanohydrins). Second step is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which typically uses a strong acid like HCl rather than a weak acid like CH3COOH. Thus A = H3O+ and B = HCl, corresponding to choice 4.
