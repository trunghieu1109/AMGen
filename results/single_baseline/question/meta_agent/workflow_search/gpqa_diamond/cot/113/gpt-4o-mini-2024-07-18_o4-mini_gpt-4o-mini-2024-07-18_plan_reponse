        "response": "First step is cyanohydrin formation: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN under acidic conditions to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Acid is required to protonate the alkoxide intermediate and to generate HCN in situ, so A must be H3O+, not NaHSO3 (bisulfite gives bisulfite adducts, not cyanohydrins). Second step is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which typically uses a strong acid like HCl rather than a weak acid like CH3COOH. Thus A = H3O+ and B = HCl, corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
