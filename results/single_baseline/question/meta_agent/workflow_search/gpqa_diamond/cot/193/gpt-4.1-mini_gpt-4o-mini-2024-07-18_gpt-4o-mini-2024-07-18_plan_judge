Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the partition function Z of the system, we need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. We will calculate the energy E for each configuration and then use the Boltzmann factor e^(-E/kT) to find the contribution to the partition function from each configuration. After calculating the contributions, we will sum them up to find Z. The correct expression for Z will match one of the provided choices.

Answer:Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)
Extracted answer: Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)
Correct answer: 1
