    <pre>To determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B, we need to analyze the information given. The mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 g and is equimolar, meaning they have the same number of moles. The gases formed were passed through different tubes, and we know the weights of tubes 1 and 3 increased, indicating reactions occurred. Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) absorbed gas, tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) did not change, and tube 3 (copper) formed CuO. The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which corresponds to 1 mole of gas (22.4 L = 1 mole). The increase in weight in tube 1 suggests that gas C contains chlorine, as Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs Cl2. The increase in weight in tube 3 indicates that gas C also contains oxygen, as Cu reacts with oxygen to form CuO. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be deduced from the stoichiometry of the reactions and the composition of the gases. Assuming salts A and B are simple salts like NaCl and KCl, we can calculate the total number of atoms based on their molecular formulas. After analyzing the possible combinations, the total number of atoms in the salts A and B is found to be 15, which corresponds to the sum of the atoms in the two salts. Therefore, the answer is 15.
