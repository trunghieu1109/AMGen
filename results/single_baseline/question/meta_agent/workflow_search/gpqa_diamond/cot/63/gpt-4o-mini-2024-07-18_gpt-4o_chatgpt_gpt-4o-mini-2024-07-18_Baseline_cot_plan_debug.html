    <pre>The problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that decomposes to form gases. The gases are passed through three tubes: Tube 1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, Tube 2 with Ca(OH)2 solution, and Tube 3 with red-hot copper. The increase in weight of Tube 1 by 3.60 g suggests water vapor was absorbed, indicating 3.60 g of water was formed. The increase in weight of Tube 3 by 0.80 g indicates that 0.80 g of oxygen reacted with copper to form CuO. The fact that the weight of Tube 2 did not change suggests no CO2 was absorbed, meaning no CO2 was formed. The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles (since 1 mole of gas at STP is 22.4 liters). The total mass of the gases formed is 3.60 g (H2O) + 0.80 g (O2) = 4.40 g. The initial mass of the salts was 7.20 g, so the mass of gas C is 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g. Since 0.1 moles of gas C weighs 2.80 g, the molar mass of gas C is 28 g/mol, which corresponds to nitrogen (N2). Therefore, the gases formed are H2O, O2, and N2. The salts A and B must contain elements that can form these gases. Since the mixture is equimolar, we assume each salt contributes equally to the formation of these gases. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be deduced by considering the stoichiometry of the decomposition reactions and the gases formed. The key is to balance the equations and count the atoms involved. Given the choices, the most reasonable total number of atoms in salts A and B is 19.
