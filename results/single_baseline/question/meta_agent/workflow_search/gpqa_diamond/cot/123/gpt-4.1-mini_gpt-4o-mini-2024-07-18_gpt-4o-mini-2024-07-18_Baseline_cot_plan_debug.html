    <pre>To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we need to understand the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance traveled by the particles. The Lorentz factor (Î³) affects the time dilation and length contraction experienced by the particles. As the Lorentz factor increases, the effective distance that the particles can travel before decaying also increases. Given that one third of the particles currently reach the walls at a Lorentz factor of ~20, we need to find a Lorentz factor that allows two thirds to reach the walls. This suggests that we need to increase the Lorentz factor significantly. The choices provided are 28, 40, 68, and 54. We can analyze these options to see which one would likely allow for a higher proportion of particles to reach the walls. A higher Lorentz factor would mean that particles travel further before decaying, thus increasing the fraction that reaches the walls. Among the choices, 40 is a reasonable increase from 20, but 54 and 68 are even higher. Given the need for a significant increase to reach two thirds, 54 seems like a plausible choice, as it is a substantial increase from 20 and would likely allow more particles to reach the walls. However, 68 is the highest and would likely ensure that two thirds reach the walls. Therefore, the best choice is likely 68, as it represents a significant increase in the Lorentz factor, allowing for a greater fraction of particles to reach the detector walls.
