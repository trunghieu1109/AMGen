Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent WX0U', content='We have particles produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius R=30 m, with proper lifetime τ₀ and Lorentz factor γ. The survival probability to reach the wall is P=exp(–t/(γτ₀)) where t≈R/(c). Given that at γ₁=20, P₁=1/3, so exp(–R/(20cτ₀))=1/3 ⇒ R/(20cτ₀)=ln3 ⇒ R/(cτ₀)=20 ln3. We want γ₂ such that P₂=2/3, so exp(–R/(γ₂cτ₀))=2/3 ⇒ R/(γ₂cτ₀)=ln(3/2). Hence γ₂=[R/(cτ₀)]/[ln(3/2)]=20 ln3 / ln(3/2) ≈20×1.0986/0.4055≈54.16 ⇒≈54.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
