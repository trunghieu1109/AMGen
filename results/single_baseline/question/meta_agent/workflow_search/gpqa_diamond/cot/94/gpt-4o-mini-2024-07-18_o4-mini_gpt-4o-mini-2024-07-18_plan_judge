Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: 3,3,6-Trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one upon epoxidation gives two epoxides (at C1–C2 and C5–C6). Treatment with a methylcuprate opens the more substituted epoxide preferentially at C6, installing a methyl there and an OH at C5, while the 1–2 alkene remains. This yields 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one.
