    <pre>First, we need to normalize the state |alpha&gt;. The state is given as (1+i)|up&gt; + (2-i)|down&gt;. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients: sqrt((1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up&gt; + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down&gt;. The operator A has matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise, which means A = (0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0). The eigenstates of A are (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) and (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). We need to express |alpha&gt; in terms of these eigenstates. The probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of |alpha&gt; onto each eigenstate. The average value of the operator is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha&gt;. After calculations, the probabilities are 0.54 and 0.46, and the average value is 3*hbar/sqrt(7).
