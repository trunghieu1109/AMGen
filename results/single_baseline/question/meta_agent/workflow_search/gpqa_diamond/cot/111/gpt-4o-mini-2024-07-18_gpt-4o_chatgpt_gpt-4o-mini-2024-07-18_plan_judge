Question: Example(question='Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>, where |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. ', choice1='0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice2='0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice3='0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)', choice4='0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: First, we need to normalize the state |alpha>. The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients: sqrt((1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>. The operator A has matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise, which means A = (0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0). The eigenstates of A are (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) and (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). We need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. The probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate. The average value of the operator is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>. After calculations, the probabilities are 0.54 and 0.46, and the average value is 3*hbar/sqrt(7).
