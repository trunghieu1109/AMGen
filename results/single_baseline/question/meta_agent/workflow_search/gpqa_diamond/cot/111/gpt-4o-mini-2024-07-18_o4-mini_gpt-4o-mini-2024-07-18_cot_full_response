Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 43uU', content='First, normalize |α>∝(1+i)|↑>+(2−i)|↓>: normalization factor N=1/√(|1+i|²+|2−i|²)=1/√(2+5)=1/√7. The operator A=(ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] has eigenstates |+>=(|↑>+|↓>)/√2, |−>=(|↑>−|↓>)/√2 with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Compute amplitudes: ⟨+|α⟩=N/√2[(1+i)+(2−i)]=3/√(14) →P+=9/14≈0.643; ⟨−|α⟩=N/√2[(1+i)−(2−i)]=(−1+2i)/√(14) →P−=5/14≈0.357. Expectation ⟨A⟩=(ħ/2)(P+−P−)=(ħ/2)(4/14)=ħ/7.
