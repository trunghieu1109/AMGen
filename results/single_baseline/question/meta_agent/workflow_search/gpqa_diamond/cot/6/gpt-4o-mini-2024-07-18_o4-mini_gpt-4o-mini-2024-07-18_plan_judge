Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We need the threshold energy for γ + γ_CMB → e+ e−. The condition is s = 2 Eγ E_CMB (1−cosθ) ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. Taking head‐on collisions (1−cosθ)=2 gives 4 Eγ E_CMB = (2 m_e c^2)^2, or Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB. With m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV=5.11×10^5 eV, we get (5.11×10^5 eV)^2 =2.611×10^11 eV^2. Dividing by E_CMB=10^−3 eV yields Eγ ≈2.61×10^14 eV =2.61×10^5 GeV. This matches choice3 (~2.6×10^5 GeV).
