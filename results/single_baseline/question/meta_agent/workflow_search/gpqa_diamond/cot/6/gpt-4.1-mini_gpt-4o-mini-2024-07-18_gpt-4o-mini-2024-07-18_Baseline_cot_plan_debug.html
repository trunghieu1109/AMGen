    <pre>To determine the energy threshold for high energy gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process of annihilation with CMB photons, we can use the concept of threshold energy in pair production. The threshold energy for the process \( \gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \) occurs when the energy of the gamma-ray photon is sufficient to create an electron-positron pair. The energy of the CMB photon is given as \( 10^{-3} \text{ eV} \). The threshold condition requires that the energy of the gamma-ray photon must be at least twice the energy of the CMB photon, since we need to account for both the electron and positron. Therefore, the threshold energy for the gamma-ray photon can be calculated as follows: \( E_{\gamma} = 2 \times E_{CMB} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} \). However, we need to convert this energy into GeV for comparison with the choices provided. Since \( 1 \text{ GeV} = 10^{9} \text{ eV} \), we have \( E_{\gamma} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ eV} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{-9} \text{ GeV} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \text{ GeV} \). This is much lower than the options provided, indicating that we need to consider the energy of the gamma-ray photon that would interact with multiple CMB photons. The effective energy threshold for significant interactions is typically much higher, and the choices provided suggest energies in the range of hundreds of thousands of GeV. The correct choice must be determined based on the typical threshold for significant pair production interactions with CMB photons, which is known to be around 100 GeV or higher. After evaluating the choices, the most appropriate answer based on known physics is likely to be the highest energy option provided, which is &#39;3.9*1e5 GeV&#39;.
