            "The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.",

        "response": "We need the threshold energy for \u03b3 + \u03b3_CMB \u2192 e+ e\u2212. The condition is s = 2 E\u03b3 E_CMB (1\u2212cos\u03b8) \u2265 (2 m_e c^2)^2. Taking head\u2010on collisions (1\u2212cos\u03b8)=2 gives 4 E\u03b3 E_CMB = (2 m_e c^2)^2, or E\u03b3 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB. With m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV=5.11\u00d710^5 eV, we get (5.11\u00d710^5 eV)^2 =2.611\u00d710^11 eV^2. Dividing by E_CMB=10^\u22123 eV yields E\u03b3 \u22482.61\u00d710^14 eV =2.61\u00d710^5 GeV. This matches choice3 (~2.6\u00d710^5 GeV).\n\nAnswer:C)",
