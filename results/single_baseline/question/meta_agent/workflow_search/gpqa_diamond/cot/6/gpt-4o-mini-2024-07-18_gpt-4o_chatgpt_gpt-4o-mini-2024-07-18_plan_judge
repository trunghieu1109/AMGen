proposed answer: To find the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process \( \gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \), we need to consider the threshold energy for this reaction. The threshold energy is determined by the condition that the center-of-mass energy is equal to twice the rest mass energy of the electron (since an electron-positron pair is created). The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. The average energy of a CMB photon is given as \( 10^{-3} \) eV. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of the gamma-ray photon \( E_\gamma \) and the CMB photon \( E_{CMB} \) must satisfy: \( E_\gamma E_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2 \). Solving for \( E_\gamma \), we have: \( E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \text{ MeV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} \). Converting 0.511 MeV to eV gives 511,000 eV, so \( E_\gamma = \frac{(511,000 \text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = 2.6 \times 10^{11} \text{ eV} = 2.6 \times 10^5 \text{ GeV} \).
