            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",

        "response": "A conductor shields external fields from internal distributions. A charge +q inside the cavity induces \u2013q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. From outside, the induced +q on the outer surface behaves like a point charge at the conductor\u2019s center, so E = (1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)\u00b7q/L\u00b2 radially. Hence choice 4 (D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
