            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",

        "response": "In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor is determined only by the total charge enclosed. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is inside the cavity, the outer surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q induced on it. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor (at distance L) will be as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is L, and the electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated. Since L > R, we can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge at distance L. Thus, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * (q/L\u00b2).\n\nAnswer:C",
