Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. By the properties of conductors, the electric field inside the conductor (outside the cavity) is zero, and the charge on the conductor's surface will redistribute to maintain this. The charge +q induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the charge +q on the outer surface, which behaves as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is given by the field due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, which is $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
