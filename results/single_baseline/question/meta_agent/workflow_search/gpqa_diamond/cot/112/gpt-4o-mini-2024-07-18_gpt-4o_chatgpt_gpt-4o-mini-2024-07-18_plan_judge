Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers, which is characteristic of an O-H stretch, indicating the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a C=C double bond. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which could correspond to a common fragment like CH3CO or similar. Considering these observations, the compound likely contains both a carbonyl group and an O-H group, along with C=C bonds. The presence of both a carbonyl and an O-H group suggests a carboxylic acid or an ester. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. C6H10O2 fits the observations as it can have a carboxylic acid group (broad O-H stretch and C=O stretch) and C=C bonds (vinyl hydrogens).
