            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.",

        "response": "FTIR: broad absorption at 3000 cm\u22121 indicates an O\u2013H group; peaks at 1700 cm\u22121 indicate a carbonyl (C=O) and at 1650 cm\u22121 a C=C bond. 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, confirming C=C. Mass fragment at m/z 45 is consistent with cleavage near an OH-bearing carbonyl. Calculate degrees of unsaturation: C6H10O2 gives (2\u00d76+2\u221210)/2=2 DU, matching one C=O and one C=C. Other formulas either lack sufficient oxygens for an OH or have incorrect unsaturation. Therefore the formula is C6H10O2.\n\nAnswer:A",
