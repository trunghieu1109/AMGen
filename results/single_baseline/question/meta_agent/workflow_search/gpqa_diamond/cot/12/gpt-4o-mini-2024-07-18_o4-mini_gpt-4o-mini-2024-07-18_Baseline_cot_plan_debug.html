    <pre>Step 1: Hydrogenation of R-(+)-limonene with 1 equiv H₂ on Pd/C selectively reduces the exocyclic isopropenyl double bond to give a saturated isopropyl substituent at C4, preserving the R configuration at that center (product 1).

Step 2: mCPBA epoxidizes the remaining endocyclic C1–C2 double bond to give the cyclohexane 1,2-epoxide (product 2).

Step 3: Ring-opening of the epoxide with NaOMe proceeds by SN2 at the less substituted carbon (C2), placing OMe at C2 and OH at C1 trans to each other (product 3). The C2 center inverts from its epoxide configuration, while C1 retains the configuration set during epoxidation.

Step 4: Esterification of the C1–OH with propionic acid/DCC/DMAP yields the propionate at C1 (product 4) without altering stereochemistry.

We expect substituents at C1 (O-propionate) and C2 (OMe) to be trans (opposite faces) and the original R configuration at C4 preserved. Among the choices, only D assigns 1S,2R (opposite configurations at C1 and C2 → trans) and 4R. Hence the correct answer is D.
