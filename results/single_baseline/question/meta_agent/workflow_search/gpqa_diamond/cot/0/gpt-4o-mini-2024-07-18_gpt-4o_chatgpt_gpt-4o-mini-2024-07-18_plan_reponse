        "response": "To distinguish two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) are related by \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV\u00b7s). The lifetime of a state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (\u0394t). For the first state with a lifetime of 10^-9 s, the energy uncertainty is \u0394E1 \u2265 \u0127/(2 * 10^-9 s). For the second state with a lifetime of 10^-8 s, the energy uncertainty is \u0394E2 \u2265 \u0127/(2 * 10^-8 s). To resolve the two states, the energy difference between them should be greater than the larger of these uncertainties. Calculating these uncertainties: \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58 x 10^-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58 x 10^-8 eV. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than 6.58 x 10^-7 eV. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than this value.\n\nAnswer:D)",
