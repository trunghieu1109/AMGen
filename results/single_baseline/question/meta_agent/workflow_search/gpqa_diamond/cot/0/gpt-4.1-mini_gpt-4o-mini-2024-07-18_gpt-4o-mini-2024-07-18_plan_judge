Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To distinguish between two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the uncertainty principle, which relates the energy uncertainty to the lifetime of the states. The energy uncertainty ΔE can be estimated using the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state. For the two states with lifetimes τ1 = 10^-9 sec and τ2 = 10^-8 sec, we can calculate the energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) will have a larger uncertainty in energy. We need to ensure that the energy difference ΔE between the two states is greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties to clearly resolve them. The larger lifetime gives a smaller uncertainty, so we calculate the energy uncertainty for τ1 and τ2 and compare it to the options provided.
