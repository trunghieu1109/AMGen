Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To resolve two energy levels, their separation must exceed the linewidth given by the energy–time uncertainty ΔE≈ħ/τ. For τ1=10⁻⁹ s, ΔE₁≈ħ/τ₁≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV; for τ2=10⁻⁸ s, ΔE₂≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. The larger width (~7×10⁻⁷ eV) sets the resolution limit, so ΔE should be ≫10⁻⁶ eV. Among the choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV meets this.
