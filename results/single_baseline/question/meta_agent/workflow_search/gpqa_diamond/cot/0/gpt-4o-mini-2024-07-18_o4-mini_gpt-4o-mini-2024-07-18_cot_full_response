Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent j36X', content='To resolve two energy levels, their separation must exceed the linewidth given by the energy–time uncertainty ΔE≈ħ/τ. For τ1=10⁻⁹\u2009s, ΔE₁≈ħ/τ₁≈6.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV; for τ2=10⁻⁸\u2009s, ΔE₂≈6.6×10⁻⁸\u2009eV. The larger width (~7×10⁻⁷\u2009eV) sets the resolution limit, so ΔE should be ≫10⁻⁶\u2009eV. Among the choices, only 10⁻⁴\u2009eV meets this.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
