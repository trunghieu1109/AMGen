Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To distinguish two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV·s). The lifetime of a state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt). For the first state with a lifetime of 10^-9 s, the energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-9 s). For the second state with a lifetime of 10^-8 s, the energy uncertainty is ΔE2 ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-8 s). To resolve the two states, the energy difference between them should be greater than the larger of these uncertainties. Calculating these uncertainties: ΔE1 ≈ 6.58 x 10^-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.58 x 10^-8 eV. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than 6.58 x 10^-7 eV. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than this value.
