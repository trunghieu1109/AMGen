        "response": "To distinguish between two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the uncertainty principle, which relates the energy uncertainty to the lifetime of the states. The energy uncertainty \u0394E can be estimated using the relation \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime of the state. For the two states with lifetimes \u03c41 = 10^-9 sec and \u03c42 = 10^-8 sec, we can calculate the energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) will have a larger uncertainty in energy. We need to ensure that the energy difference \u0394E between the two states is greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties to clearly resolve them. The larger lifetime gives a smaller uncertainty, so we calculate the energy uncertainty for \u03c41 and \u03c42 and compare it to the options provided.\n\nAnswer:C",
