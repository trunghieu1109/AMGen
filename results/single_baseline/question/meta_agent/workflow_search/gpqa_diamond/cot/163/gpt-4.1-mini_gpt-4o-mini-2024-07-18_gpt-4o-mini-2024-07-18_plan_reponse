            "Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.",

        "response": "To determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we can use the mass function derived from the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital periods. The mass function relates the masses of the stars to their radial velocity amplitudes and the period of the orbit. For a binary system, the mass function can be expressed as: f(M) = (K1^3 * P) / (2 * pi * G), where K1 is the radial velocity amplitude of the primary star, P is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant. We can compare the mass functions of both systems to find the mass ratio. Given the amplitudes and periods, we can calculate the mass function for both systems and then find the ratio of their total masses. After performing the calculations, we find that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times the mass of system_2, leading us to conclude that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.6.\n\nAnswer:~ 0.6",
