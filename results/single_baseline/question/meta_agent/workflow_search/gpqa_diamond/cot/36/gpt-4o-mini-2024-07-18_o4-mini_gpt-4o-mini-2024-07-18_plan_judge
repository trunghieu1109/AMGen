Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Propionaldehyde reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) under BF3 to give the 1,3-dithiane derivative A. Step 2: A is deprotonated by BuLi to give the lithio-dithiane B at the carbon between the two sulfurs. Step 3: B undergoes alkylation with bromoethane to give the 2-ethyl-2-propyl-1,3-dithiane C. Step 4: C is hydrolyzed by HgCl₂/H₂O/H⁺ to remove the dithiane and yield hexan-3-one (D), a ketone with a propyl and an ethyl substituent. Step 5: D undergoes a Wittig reaction with a phosphonium ylide derived from 3-bromopentane (via PPh₃/BuLi), which introduces an alkene linking two identical sets of substituents: on each alkene carbon there is one propyl and one ethyl group. The resulting alkene E is symmetric (either E or Z isomer has a symmetry element equating the two halves). In E the carbons are: (1) Ethyl CH₃ (both ends equivalent) → 1 signal; (2) Ethyl CH₂ (α to alkene) → 1 signal; (3) Propyl CH₂ (α to alkene) → 1 signal; (4) Propyl CH₂ (β to alkene) → 1 signal; (5) Propyl CH₃ → 1 signal; (6) the two equivalent alkene carbons → 1 signal. Total = 6 distinct 13C resonances.
