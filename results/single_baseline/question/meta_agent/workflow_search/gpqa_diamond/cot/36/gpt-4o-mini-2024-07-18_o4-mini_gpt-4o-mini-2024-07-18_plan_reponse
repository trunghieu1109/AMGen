        "response": "Step 1: Propionaldehyde reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) under BF3 to give the 1,3-dithiane derivative A. Step 2: A is deprotonated by BuLi to give the lithio-dithiane B at the carbon between the two sulfurs. Step 3: B undergoes alkylation with bromoethane to give the 2-ethyl-2-propyl-1,3-dithiane C. Step 4: C is hydrolyzed by HgCl\u2082/H\u2082O/H\u207a to remove the dithiane and yield hexan-3-one (D), a ketone with a propyl and an ethyl substituent. Step 5: D undergoes a Wittig reaction with a phosphonium ylide derived from 3-bromopentane (via PPh\u2083/BuLi), which introduces an alkene linking two identical sets of substituents: on each alkene carbon there is one propyl and one ethyl group. The resulting alkene E is symmetric (either E or Z isomer has a symmetry element equating the two halves). In E the carbons are: (1) Ethyl CH\u2083 (both ends equivalent) \u2192 1 signal; (2) Ethyl CH\u2082 (\u03b1 to alkene) \u2192 1 signal; (3) Propyl CH\u2082 (\u03b1 to alkene) \u2192 1 signal; (4) Propyl CH\u2082 (\u03b2 to alkene) \u2192 1 signal; (5) Propyl CH\u2083 \u2192 1 signal; (6) the two equivalent alkene carbons \u2192 1 signal. Total = 6 distinct 13C resonances.\n\nAnswer:D)",
