Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: First, we need to determine the rest masses of the two fragments. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, then the rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m, which is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, 3m = 0.99M, giving m = 0.33M. The rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV/c^2. The rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The total energy is conserved, so the kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the momentum of the two fragments is equal and opposite. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation, the total energy of the heavier fragment is E1 = sqrt((0.66M)^2c^4 + p^2c^2). The kinetic energy T1 = E1 - 0.66Mc^2. In the classical approximation, T1_classical = (1/2)(0.66M)v^2, where v is the velocity of the heavier fragment. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy is the answer.
