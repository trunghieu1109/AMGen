Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first need to understand the mass distribution after the fission. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m and the mass of the heavier fragment be 2m. According to the problem, the total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, which means: m + 2m = 0.99M, leading to 3m = 0.99M, thus m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. The rest mass energies of the fragments are then E1 = 0.33M * c^2 and E2 = 0.66M * c^2. In a relativistic scenario, we need to apply conservation of momentum and energy to find the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment T1. In the classical approximation, we would use the formula for kinetic energy T = (1/2)mv^2, which does not account for relativistic effects. The difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical approximation can be calculated, and based on the choices given, we can determine the correct answer.
