Question: {'question': 'An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent jk5N', content='Initial rest energy M c^2 =300 GeV. Sum of fragment rest masses =0.99M so Q =0.01M c^2 =3 GeV total KE. Let m2=2m1 ⇒3m1=0.99M ⇒m1=0.33M, m2=0.66M. In two-body decay at rest, E1 = (M^2 + m1^2 - m2^2)/(2M)c^2 ⇒E1 ≃0.33665M c^2 ≃101 GeV ⇒T1_rel =E1 -m1c^2 ≃1.995 GeV. Nonrelativistically, T1_class =Q·(m2/(m1+m2))^{-1}? Actually T1/T2 =m2/m1 =2⇒T1_class =(2/3)Q =2.0 GeV. Difference ≃2.0 -1.995 =5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
