        "response": "Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) undergoes a suprafacial Diels\u2013Alder with maleic anhydride, giving a bicyclo[4.2.0] adduct in which the two anhydride substituents end up cis (they are introduced on the same face).  \nStep 2: Methanolysis (acid\u2010catalyzed) converts the anhydride to the corresponding cis\u2010dimethyl diester, preserving that cis relationship of the two ester substituents (positions 10 and 11 in the final numbering).  \nStep 3: The remaining double bond in the bicyclo[4.2.0] adduct reacts with cyclopentadiene under Diels\u2013Alder conditions; the original diesters merely sit as spectator substituents and remain cis.  \nThus in the final product the two ester groups (10,11) must have the same configuration (both R or both S). Among the choices, only choice 1 has 10R,11R (cis).\n\nAnswer:A",
