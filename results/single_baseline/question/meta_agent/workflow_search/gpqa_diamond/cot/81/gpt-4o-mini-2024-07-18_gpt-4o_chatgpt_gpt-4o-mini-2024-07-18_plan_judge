Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction sequence involves a Diels-Alder reaction between cyclooctatetraene and maleic anhydride, followed by methanolysis to form a diester, and then another Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene. The stereochemistry of the final product is determined by the stereochemistry of the intermediates and the endo rule of Diels-Alder reactions. The major isomer is likely to have the endo stereochemistry for both Diels-Alder reactions.
