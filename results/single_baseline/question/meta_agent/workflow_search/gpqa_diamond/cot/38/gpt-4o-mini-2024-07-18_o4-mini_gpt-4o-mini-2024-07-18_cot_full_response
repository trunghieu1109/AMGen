Question: {'question': 'We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?', 'choice1': '0.85', 'choice2': '1.1', 'choice3': '0.35', 'choice4': '0.6'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='We need to normalize the wave function ψ(x) = (a/√(1+x)) – 0.5 i over x ∈ [1,3]. The probability density is |ψ|^2 = (a^2/(1+x)) + 0.25. The normalization condition ∫₁³ |ψ|^2 dx = 1 gives: a^2 ∫₁³ dx/(1+x) + 0.25·(3–1) = 1 ⇒ a^2 [ln(1+x)]₁³ + 0.5 = 1 ⇒ a^2 (ln4 – ln2) = 0.5 ⇒ a^2 ln2 = 0.5 ⇒ a^2 = 0.5/ln2 ≈ 0.7213 ⇒ a ≈ √0.7213 ≈ 0.8493 ≈ 0.85\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
