    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x&lt;1 and x&gt;3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;0.85&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1.1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.35&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.6&#39;}

    <pre>To find the value of &#39;a&#39;, we need to normalize the wave function over the region where the particles are found, which is between x=1 and x=3. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, which is |(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i|^2. We integrate this probability density from x=1 to x=3 and set the integral equal to 1 to find &#39;a&#39;. The magnitude squared is |(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i|^2 = (a^2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25. The integral becomes ∫[(a^2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3. Solving this integral and setting it equal to 1 will give us the value of &#39;a&#39;.
