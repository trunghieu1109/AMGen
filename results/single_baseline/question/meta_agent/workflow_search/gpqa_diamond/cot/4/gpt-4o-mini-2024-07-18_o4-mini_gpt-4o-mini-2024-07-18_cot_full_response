Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TiAN', content='We have a spin-1/2 operator \nP·n = (ℏ/2)(σ·n). For an arbitrary direction in the x–z plane, n=(sinθ,0,cosθ). The eigenvector with eigenvalue +ℏ/2 satisfies (σ·n)|ψ⟩=|ψ⟩. Writing |ψ⟩=(a,b)^T gives:\n[cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ](a,b)^T=(a,b)^T. Solving yields b/a=tan(θ/2). Normalization |a|^2+|b|^2=1 gives a=cos(θ/2), b=sin(θ/2). Hence the normalized spinor is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). This corresponds to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
