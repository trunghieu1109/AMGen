            "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n",

        "response": "We have a spin-1/2 operator \nP\u00b7n = (\u210f/2)(\u03c3\u00b7n). For an arbitrary direction in the x\u2013z plane, n=(sin\u03b8,0,cos\u03b8). The eigenvector with eigenvalue +\u210f/2 satisfies (\u03c3\u00b7n)|\u03c8\u27e9=|\u03c8\u27e9. Writing |\u03c8\u27e9=(a,b)^T gives:\n[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8; sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8](a,b)^T=(a,b)^T. Solving yields b/a=tan(\u03b8/2). Normalization |a|^2+|b|^2=1 gives a=cos(\u03b8/2), b=sin(\u03b8/2). Hence the normalized spinor is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). This corresponds to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
