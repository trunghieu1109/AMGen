proposed answer: To find the eigenvector of the operator \( \vec{P} \) along the direction \( \vec{n} \) in the x-z plane, we first express \( \vec{n} \) as \( \vec{n} = (\sin \theta, 0, \cos \theta) \). The operator \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \) is then given by \( P_x \sin \theta + P_z \cos \theta \). The matrices for \( P_x \), \( P_y \), and \( P_z \) are given as Pauli matrices times \( \hbar/2 \). Specifically, \( P_x = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \), \( P_y = (\hbar/2) \sigma_y \), and \( P_z = (\hbar/2) \sigma_z \). The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \) for the operator \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \) is the spinor that points in the direction \( \vec{n} \). This is given by the spinor \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \).
