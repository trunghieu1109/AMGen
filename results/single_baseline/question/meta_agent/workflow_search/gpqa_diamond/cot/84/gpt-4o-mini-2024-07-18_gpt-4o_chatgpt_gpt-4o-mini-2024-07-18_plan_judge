Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25, where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, it cancels out in the ratio. The equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes. The semi-major axis can be found using the radial velocity method, where the Doppler shift is related to the planet's mass and distance from the star. The Doppler shift is proportional to the planet's mass divided by the semi-major axis squared. Given the Doppler shifts, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes and thus the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.
