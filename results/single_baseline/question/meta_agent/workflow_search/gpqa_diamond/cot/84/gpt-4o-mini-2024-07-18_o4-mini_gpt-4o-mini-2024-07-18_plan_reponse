            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures Teq1/Teq2. For planets with the same albedo around the same star, Teq \u221d a^(\u22121/2). The orbital semimajor axis a relates to the RV semi\u2010amplitude K by K \u221d Mp\u2009a^(\u22121/2), so a \u221d (Mp/K)^2. Thus Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = (Mp2/Mp1)\u00b7(K1/K2). From \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, we get K1 \u2248300000\u2009km/s\u00d70.03/6300\u22481.43\u2009km/s, K2\u22481.90\u2009km/s. With Mp1=7\u2009M\u2295, Mp2=5\u2009M\u2295: Teq1/Teq2=(5/7)\u00d7(1.43/1.90)\u22480.54.\n\nAnswer:C)",
