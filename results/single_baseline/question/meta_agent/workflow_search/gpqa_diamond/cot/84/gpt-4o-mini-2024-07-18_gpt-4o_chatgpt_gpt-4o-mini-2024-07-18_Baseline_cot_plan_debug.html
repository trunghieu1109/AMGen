    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 1.05&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.98&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.53&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.30&#39;}

    <pre>To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25, where T_star is the star&#39;s temperature, R_star is the star&#39;s radius, a is the semi-major axis of the planet&#39;s orbit, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, it cancels out in the ratio. The equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes. The semi-major axis can be found using the radial velocity method, where the Doppler shift is related to the planet&#39;s mass and distance from the star. The Doppler shift is proportional to the planet&#39;s mass divided by the semi-major axis squared. Given the Doppler shifts, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes and thus the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.
