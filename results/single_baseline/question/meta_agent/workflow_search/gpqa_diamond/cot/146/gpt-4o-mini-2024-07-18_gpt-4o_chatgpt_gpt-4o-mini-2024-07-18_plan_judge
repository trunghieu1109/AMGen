proposed answer: In the annihilation process, a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The rest energy of the proton and antiproton is approximately 938 MeV each. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume its kinetic energy is negligible. The total energy available from the annihilation is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. This energy is used to create the four particles, each with a rest mass energy of 300 MeV, totaling 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the particles. The kinetic energy per particle is (1876 MeV - 1200 MeV) / 4 = 169 MeV. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2, we can solve for the velocity of particle A. The total energy E for each particle is 300 MeV + 169 MeV = 469 MeV. Solving for the velocity, we find that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.91c.
