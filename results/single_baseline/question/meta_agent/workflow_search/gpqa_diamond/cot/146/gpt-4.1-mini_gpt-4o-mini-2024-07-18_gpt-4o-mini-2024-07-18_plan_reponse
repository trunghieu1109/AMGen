        "response": "To find the velocity of particle A in the given annihilation process, we need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy of the system includes the rest mass energy of the antiproton and the proton, and the kinetic energy of the antiproton. After the annihilation, we have two particles A with mass m_A. We can use the relation for relativistic energy and momentum to find the velocity of the produced particles A. Given that m_Ac^2 = 300 MeV, we can calculate the total energy and momentum before and after the annihilation to find the velocity of particle A. After performing the calculations, we find that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.91c.\n\nAnswer:B",
