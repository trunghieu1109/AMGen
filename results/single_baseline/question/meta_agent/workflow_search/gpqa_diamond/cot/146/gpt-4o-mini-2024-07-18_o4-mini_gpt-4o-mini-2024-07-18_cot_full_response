Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cIUN', content='Initial total energy from p and slow \x1b[0m\x1b[0manti-p: 2×938MeV=1876MeV. Rest energy of four A’s: 4×300MeV=1200MeV. Kinetic energy available: 676MeV, or 169MeV per A. Total energy per A: 300+169=469MeV gives γ=469/300≈1.563, so β=√(1−1/γ²)≈0.77.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
