            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",
            "A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm",
            "A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm",

        "response": "The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm, indicating symmetry, and two peaks in the 13C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, suggesting a symmetrical structure. The reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene likely forms a Diels-Alder adduct. The major and minor products both have the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY spectrum of the major product shows a cross-peak, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons. The choices given involve different proton environments. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are likely to be spatially close in the major product, as the 6H singlet could correspond to methyl groups and the 2H singlet to protons on a methylene group adjacent to the anhydride or alkene moiety. This spatial proximity would result in a NOESY cross-peak.\n\nAnswer:A)",
