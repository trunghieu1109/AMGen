            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",

        "response": "To determine which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the 2D NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product, we need to consider the nature of the cross-peaks in NOESY spectra. Cross-peaks indicate spatial proximity between protons. The major product has a specific set of resonances, and we need to identify which pair of resonances would likely show a cross-peak based on their integrals and chemical shifts. The presence of a 6H singlet suggests a symmetrical environment, while the 2H singlet or doublet indicates a different environment. The most likely candidates for a cross-peak would be between a singlet and a doublet or another singlet that indicates proximity. Analyzing the choices, the first option (A) has a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet, which could indicate proximity, making it a strong candidate for the cross-peak. The other options either have doublets or do not match the expected pattern of connectivity as well as option A does.\n\nAnswer:A",
