            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",

        "response": "The product is a norbornene\u2010type Diels\u2013Alder adduct of maleic anhydride and tetramethylcyclopentadiene. In the adduct the maleic anhydride ring becomes saturated (two equivalent CH groups) and appears as a 2H singlet downfield (~3.5 ppm) because each CH is flanked by two carbonyls. The four methyl groups on the former diene end up in two chemically distinct sets of two (two 6H singlets). In the endo (major) adduct the anhydride CHs lie under one set of methyls (endo methyls) so you observe an NOE cross\u2010peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H methyl singlet at ~1.7 ppm. The exo (minor) isomer lacks this proximity and thus the cross\u2010peak is weak/absent.\n\nAnswer:A)",
