    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, meaning it transits the star at a distance of 0.2 times the star&#39;s radius from the center. For the second planet to also transit, it must have an impact parameter less than or equal to 1. The second planet is larger, with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and the star is 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is 1, so we set up the condition for the second planet: b = a/R_star * cos(i) &lt;= 1, where a is the semi-major axis, R_star is the star&#39;s radius, and i is the inclination. Since the second planet shares the same orbital plane, it has the same inclination. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 = (4Ï€^2/GM_star) * a^3. We solve for the maximum P such that the second planet still transits. The first planet&#39;s period is 3 days, and it transits with b = 0.2. The second planet must have a period such that it still transits, which means its semi-major axis must be such that the impact parameter is &lt;= 1. The maximum period is when the impact parameter is exactly 1. Using the ratio of the periods and the fact that the impact parameter scales with the semi-major axis, we find the maximum period for the second planet.
