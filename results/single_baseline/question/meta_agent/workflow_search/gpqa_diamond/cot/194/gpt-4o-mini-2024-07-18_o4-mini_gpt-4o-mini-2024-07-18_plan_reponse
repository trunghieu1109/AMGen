            "Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.",

        "response": "We need the maximum period for planet 2 such that it both transits and occults given the system inclination determined by planet 1\u2019s transit.\n\n1. Determine the orbital distance of planet 1 in units of R*:\n   \u2013 P1=3\u2009d, assume M*\u2248M\u2299.\n   \u2013 a1=[GM\u2299P1\u00b2/4\u03c0\u00b2]^(1/3)\u22486.06\u00d710^9\u2009m.\n   \u2013 R*=1.5\u2009R\u2299\u22481.044\u00d710^9\u2009m \u2192 a1/R*\u22485.8.\n\n2. Use the observed impact parameter b1=0.2 to get cos\u2009i:\n   b1=(a1/R*)\u2009cos\u2009i \u2192 cos\u2009i=0.2/5.8\u22480.03448 \u2192 i\u224888.0\u00b0.\n\n3. For planet 2 (R2=2.5\u2009R\u2295), occultation requires b2 \u22641\u2013R2/R*.\n   \u2013 R2/R*\u2248(2.5\u00d76.37\u00d710^6)/(1.044\u00d710^9)\u22480.01525 \u2192 b2\u22640.98475.\n   \u2013 b2=(a2/R*)\u2009cos\u2009i \u22640.98475 \u2192 a2/R*\u22640.98475/0.03448 \u224828.56 \u2192 a2\u224828.56\u2009R*.\n\n4. Convert to period via Kepler\u2019s third law:\n   P2=P1\u2009(a2/a1)^(3/2)=3\u2009d\u2009(28.56/5.8)^(3/2)=3\u2009d\u2009(4.92)^(1.5)\n     \u22483\u00d710.91\u224832.7\u2009d.\n\nThis matches choice ~33.5\u2009d.\n\nAnswer:B)",
