    <pre>The epoxide is on C1–C6 of the cyclohexane. Me2CuLi attacks the less hindered C6, inverting its configuration, and opens the epoxide to give an alcohol at C1. Original stereochemistries at C1, C3, and C4 are retained; C6 inverts from S to R. Renumbering the cyclohexanol with OH at C1 places methyls at C1, C2 (new from C6), C4, and C5. Thus all centers are R, giving (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which is choice C.
