Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane and Me2CuLi, we need to consider the mechanism of the reaction. The organocuprate reagent (Me2CuLi) will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, leading to the opening of the epoxide. Since the epoxide is disubstituted, inversion of configuration will occur at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material and the possible products to identify which one corresponds to the expected outcome of the reaction.

Answer:(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Extracted answer: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Correct answer: 3
