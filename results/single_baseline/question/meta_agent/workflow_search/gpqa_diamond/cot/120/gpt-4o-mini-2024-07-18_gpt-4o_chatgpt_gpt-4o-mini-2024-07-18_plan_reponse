            "When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.

        "response": "The given compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a bicyclic epoxide. When reacted with Me2CuLi, the methyl group from the organocuprate will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, leading to ring opening. The less hindered carbon in this case is the one at position 6 (the bridgehead carbon), which is also the site of inversion of configuration. After the attack, the epoxide ring opens, and the methyl group is added to the less hindered carbon with inversion of configuration. The resulting product will have a new methyl group at the position where the nucleophile attacked, and the configuration at that carbon will be inverted. The product will be a cyclohexanol derivative with the methyl group added at the less hindered carbon, and the configuration at that carbon inverted.\n\nAnswer:A)",
