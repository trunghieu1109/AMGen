    <pre>To determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane and Me2CuLi, we need to consider the mechanism of the reaction. The organocuprate reagent (Me2CuLi) will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, leading to the opening of the epoxide. Since the epoxide is disubstituted, inversion of configuration will occur at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material and the possible products to identify which one corresponds to the expected outcome of the reaction.

Answer:(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol</pre>
