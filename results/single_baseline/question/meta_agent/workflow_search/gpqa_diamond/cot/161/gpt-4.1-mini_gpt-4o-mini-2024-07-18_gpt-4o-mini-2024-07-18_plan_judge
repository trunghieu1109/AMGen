Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 given the metric, we need to analyze the metric provided. The metric suggests a non-Euclidean geometry, and we can derive the area from the given expression. The area of a pseudosphere can be calculated using the formula for the area in hyperbolic geometry. The area of a pseudosphere of radius r is known to be infinite, as it extends infinitely in certain directions. Therefore, the correct choice is that the area is +âˆž.
