            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",

            "stronger \u2013 slower",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "Compare the standard reduction potentials: in acidic solution O2 + 4H+ + 4e\u2013 \u2192 2H2O has E\u00b0 = +1.229 V, while in basic solution O2 + 2H2O + 4e\u2013 \u2192 4OH\u2013 has E\u00b0 \u2248 +0.40 V. A lower E\u00b0 means a weaker oxidant, so O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic media. Kinetically, the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds faster in acidic solutions (on common catalysts like Pt) than in alkaline solutions. Therefore the correct combination is \u201cweaker \u2013 faster.\u201d\n\nAnswer:A)",
