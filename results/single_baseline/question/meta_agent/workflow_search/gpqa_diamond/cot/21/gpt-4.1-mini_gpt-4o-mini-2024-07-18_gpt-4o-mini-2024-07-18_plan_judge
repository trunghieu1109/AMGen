Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In electrochemistry, oxygen is generally considered a stronger oxidant in basic solutions due to the higher availability of hydroxide ions, which can facilitate its reduction. However, in acidic solutions, the kinetics of oxygen reduction can be slower due to the different reaction pathways and the presence of protons. Therefore, the correct combination would be that oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions and reacts slower in acidic solutions.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 3
