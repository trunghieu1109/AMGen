Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Compare the standard reduction potentials: in acidic solution O2 + 4H+ + 4e– → 2H2O has E° = +1.229 V, while in basic solution O2 + 2H2O + 4e– → 4OH– has E° ≈ +0.40 V. A lower E° means a weaker oxidant, so O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic media. Kinetically, the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds faster in acidic solutions (on common catalysts like Pt) than in alkaline solutions. Therefore the correct combination is “weaker – faster.”
