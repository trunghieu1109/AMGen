Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In electrochemistry, the thermodynamic strength of an oxidant can depend on the pH of the solution. Oxygen is generally a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. Kinetically, reactions can be faster or slower depending on the conditions. In acidic solutions, oxygen can react faster due to the availability of protons that can facilitate the reaction. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Answer:weaker – faster
Extracted answer: weaker – faster
Correct answer: 3
