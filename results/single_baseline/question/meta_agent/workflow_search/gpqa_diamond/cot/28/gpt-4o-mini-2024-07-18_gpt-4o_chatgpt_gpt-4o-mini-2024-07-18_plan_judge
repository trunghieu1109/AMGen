Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that likely disrupts the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. The gene's function can be disrupted by introducing a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation that alters the reading frame. Let's analyze the mutations:

1. Mutant 1: The sequence change is from 'TTT' to 'TTC'. Both code for phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation and unlikely to disrupt the gene function.

2. Mutant 2: The sequence change is from 'TTT' to 'TTA'. This changes phenylalanine to leucine, which is a missense mutation. It might affect the protein function, but it does not introduce a stop codon or a frameshift.

3. Mutant 3: The sequence change is from 'CTG' to 'TGT'. This changes leucine to cysteine, which is another missense mutation. It does not introduce a stop codon or a frameshift.

4. Mutant 4: The sequence change is from 'GCTGGT' to 'GCTACT'. This is a deletion of one nucleotide, causing a frameshift. A frameshift mutation is likely to disrupt the protein function by altering the reading frame and potentially introducing a premature stop codon downstream.

Mutant 4 introduces a frameshift mutation, which is most likely to disrupt the gene function and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
