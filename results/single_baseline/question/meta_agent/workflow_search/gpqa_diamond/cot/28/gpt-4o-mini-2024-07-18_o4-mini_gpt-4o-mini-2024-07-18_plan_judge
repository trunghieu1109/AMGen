Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The goal is to inactivate the enzyme by introducing a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence. Scanning the mutant sequences: Mutant 2 has “TAA” at codon 3, a stop codon that truncates translation immediately, preventing the enzyme’s function and thus eliminating the anti‐nutritional compound. The others only cause amino acid substitutions and would likely yield a partially active protein.
