            "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>",

        "response": "To determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the changes in the sequences of the mutants compared to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with 'ATGTTT', which is the start codon and part of the coding sequence. Mutant 1 has a change from 'T' to 'C' in the first exon, which may not significantly affect the protein. Mutant 2 has a change from 'T' to 'A', which could potentially change the amino acid sequence. Mutant 3 has a change from 'T' to 'T' (no change) and a change in the second codon, which may not eliminate the compound. Mutant 4 has a change from 'T' to 'A' in the second codon, which could also change the amino acid sequence. The best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound would likely be the one that introduces a significant change in the protein structure or function. Based on the analysis, Mutant 2 introduces a change that could potentially disrupt the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound more effectively than the others.\n\nAnswer:Mutant 2",
