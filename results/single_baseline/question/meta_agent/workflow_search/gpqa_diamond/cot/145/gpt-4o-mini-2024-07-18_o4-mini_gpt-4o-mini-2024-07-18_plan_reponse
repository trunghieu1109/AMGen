        "correct_answer": 1,
        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The reaction is a Diels\u2013Alder between 5\u2010fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride. By the endo rule, the anhydride moiety adopts the endo orientation, so the fluorine substituent originally on the diene ends up in the exo position at the bridgehead. Assigning the stereochemistry at that stereocenter gives an R configuration for the exo\u2010fluoro group. The rest of the bicyclic framework has the standard endo adduct configurations (3aR,4R,7S,7aS). Thus the major product is choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)",
