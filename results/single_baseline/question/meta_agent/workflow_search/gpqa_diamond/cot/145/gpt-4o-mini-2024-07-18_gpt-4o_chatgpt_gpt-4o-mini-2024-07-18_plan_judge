Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is a diene that can participate in a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, which is a dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the endo rule, which states that the endo product is favored due to secondary orbital interactions. In this case, the fluorine substituent on the diene will influence the stereochemistry of the product. The endo product will have the substituents on the newly formed six-membered ring in a cis configuration. The fluorine will be in the endo position, which is typically the position that is syn to the larger bridge. Therefore, the correct stereochemistry for the major product will have the fluorine in the endo position, which corresponds to the stereochemistry given in choice 2.
