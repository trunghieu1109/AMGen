Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the major product of the reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride, we need to consider the mechanism of the Diels-Alder reaction. 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene acts as a diene and maleic anhydride acts as a dienophile. The stereochemistry of the product will depend on the orientation of the diene and dienophile during the reaction. The major product will typically be the one that is more stable and has the correct stereochemistry based on the reaction conditions. After analyzing the choices, the correct stereochemistry and structure must be identified. The major product is likely to be the one that reflects the correct stereochemical outcome of the Diels-Alder reaction.
