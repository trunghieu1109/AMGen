        "response": "To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. Magnons are associated with the breaking of spin symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in systems with broken chiral symmetry. Pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a lattice and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the answer is Phonon.\n\nAnswer:D",
