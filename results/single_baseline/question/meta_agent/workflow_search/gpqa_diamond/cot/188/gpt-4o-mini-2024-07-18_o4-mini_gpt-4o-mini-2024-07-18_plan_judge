Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Magnons are Nambu–Goldstone bosons from broken spin‐rotational symmetry, pions are (pseudo) Nambu–Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons arise from broken translational symmetry in a crystal. Skyrmions are topological solitons rather than Nambu–Goldstone modes from a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
