Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu, we need to consider the conservation of energy. The rest mass energy of the initial particle (Pi(+)) is 139.6 MeV. The rest mass energy of the muon (mu(+)) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino (nu) is nearly massless, so we can consider its rest mass energy to be negligible. The total energy before the decay is the rest mass energy of Pi(+), and after the decay, it is the sum of the rest mass energy of mu(+) and the kinetic energy of both particles. We can calculate the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino based on the conservation of energy. After performing the calculations, we can compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct one.
