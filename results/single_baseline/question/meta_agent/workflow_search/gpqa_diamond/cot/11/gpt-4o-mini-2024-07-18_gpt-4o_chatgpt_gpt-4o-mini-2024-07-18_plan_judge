Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The problem involves the decay of a stationary Pi(+) particle into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest mass energy of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass energy of mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless. The total energy of the system before decay is the rest mass energy of Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy of the mu(+) and the neutrino, plus the rest mass energy of the mu(+). The energy conservation equation is: 139.6 MeV = KE_mu + KE_nu + 105.7 MeV. Solving for the kinetic energies, we find KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. In the center of mass frame, the mu(+) and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, we can solve for the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and neutrino. The correct choice is the one that satisfies these conditions.
