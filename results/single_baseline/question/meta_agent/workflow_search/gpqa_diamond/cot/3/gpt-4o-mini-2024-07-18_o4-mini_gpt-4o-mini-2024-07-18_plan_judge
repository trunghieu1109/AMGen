Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles the Maxwell equation ∇·B=0 must be replaced by ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ, so the divergence‐of‐B equation changes. To maintain symmetry you also get an extra monopole current term in Faraday’s law, ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−Jₘ, so the curl‐of‐E equation changes. The other two equations (Gauss’s law for E and Ampère–Maxwell law) remain structurally the same (aside from monopole symmetry), so the two modified equations are divergence of B and circulation of E.
