Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eeAI', content="In our universe, Maxwell's equations include Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (div B = 0), implying there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to div B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Additionally, the curl of the magnetic field equation (Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition) might also change to include a term for the magnetic current density. Therefore, the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be different.\n\nAnswer:B)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
