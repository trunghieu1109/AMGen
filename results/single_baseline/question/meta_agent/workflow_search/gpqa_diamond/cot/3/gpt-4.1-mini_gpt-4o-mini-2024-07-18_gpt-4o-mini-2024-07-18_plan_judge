Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwellâ€™s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In a universe where isolated magnetic poles exist, the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero, as it is in our universe where magnetic monopoles do not exist. This means that the equation related to the divergence of the magnetic field would change. Additionally, the presence of magnetic monopoles would likely affect the curl of the magnetic field as well. Therefore, the equations that would be different are those related to both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.
