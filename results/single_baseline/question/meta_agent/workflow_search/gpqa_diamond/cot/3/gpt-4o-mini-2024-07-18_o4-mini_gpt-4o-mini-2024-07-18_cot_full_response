Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eeAI', content='In the presence of magnetic monopoles the Maxwell equation ∇·B=0 must be replaced by ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ, so the divergence‐of‐B equation changes. To maintain symmetry you also get an extra monopole current term in Faraday’s law, ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−Jₘ, so the curl‐of‐E equation changes. The other two equations (Gauss’s law for E and Ampère–Maxwell law) remain structurally the same (aside from monopole symmetry), so the two modified equations are divergence of B and circulation of E.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
