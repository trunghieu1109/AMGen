            "In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell\u2019s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?",

        "response": "In the presence of magnetic monopoles the Maxwell equation \u2207\u00b7B=0 must be replaced by \u2207\u00b7B=\u03bc\u2080\u03c1\u2098, so the divergence\u2010of\u2010B equation changes. To maintain symmetry you also get an extra monopole current term in Faraday\u2019s law, \u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\u2202B/\u2202t\u2212J\u2098, so the curl\u2010of\u2010E equation changes. The other two equations (Gauss\u2019s law for E and Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell law) remain structurally the same (aside from monopole symmetry), so the two modified equations are divergence of B and circulation of E.\n\nAnswer:C)",
