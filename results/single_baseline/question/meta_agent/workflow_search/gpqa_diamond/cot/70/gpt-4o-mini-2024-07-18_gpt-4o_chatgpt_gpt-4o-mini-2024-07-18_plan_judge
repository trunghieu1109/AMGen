Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, assuming the same albedo and stellar luminosity. The orbital period is related to the orbital distance by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets is the inverse square root of the ratio of their orbital periods. Given the orbital period ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is 3.5:2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is (2/3.5)^(1/2). Calculating this gives approximately 0.75.
