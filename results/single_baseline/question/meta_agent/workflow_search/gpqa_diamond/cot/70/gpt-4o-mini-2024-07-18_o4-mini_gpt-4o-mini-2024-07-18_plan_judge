Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 for planets with orbital periods P4=3.5 and P2=2 (in arbitrary units). For circular orbits around the same star and equal albedo, Teq∝a^(−1/2), and from Kepler’s third law a∝P^(2/3). Hence T4/T2=(P4/P2)^(−1/3)=(3.5/2)^(−1/3)=(1.75)^(−1/3)≈1/1.21≈0.83.
