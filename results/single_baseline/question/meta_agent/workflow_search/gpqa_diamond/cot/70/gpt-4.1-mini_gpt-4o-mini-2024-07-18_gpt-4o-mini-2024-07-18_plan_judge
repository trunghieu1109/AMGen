Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which is proportional to the square root of the inverse of the orbital period. The periods of the planets are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, we can express the periods as follows: P1 = 1, P2 = 2, P3 = 2.5, P4 = 3.5, P5 = 5. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to 1/sqrt(P). Thus, the ratio of the temperatures T4/T2 can be calculated as sqrt(P2/P4). Substituting the periods, we have T4/T2 = sqrt(2/3.5) = sqrt(4/7) = 0.7559. This is approximately 0.75, which corresponds to choice 1.
