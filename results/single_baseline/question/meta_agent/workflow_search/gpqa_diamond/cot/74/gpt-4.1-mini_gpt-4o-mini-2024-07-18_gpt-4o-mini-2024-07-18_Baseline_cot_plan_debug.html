    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene&#39;s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by LipofectamineÂ®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5&#39;ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3&#39;\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ribosome terminated the translation early&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse&#39;}

    <pre>To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed as expected, we need to analyze the provided sequence and the potential issues that could arise during translation. The options provided suggest various reasons related to translation and protein processing. The most likely reason for the failure to express the protein could be related to the presence of a stop codon or a mutation that affects translation. The sequence provided does not show any immediate stop codons, but we need to consider the possibility of a missense mutation in the antigenic determinant sequence that could disrupt the reading frame or the protein&#39;s stability. The other options, such as the lack of a linker sequence or the absence of a specific tRNA, are less likely to be the primary cause of the issue. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that there is a missense mutation in the sequence for the antigenic determinant, which could prevent proper translation or folding of the protein.

Answer:The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation</pre>
