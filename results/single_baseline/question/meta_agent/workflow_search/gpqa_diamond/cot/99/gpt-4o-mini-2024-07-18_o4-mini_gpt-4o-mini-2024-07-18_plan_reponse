            "Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.",
            "D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.",
            "F is used for the synthesis of dyes.",
            "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "Step 1: A (C3H6) is propene. Step 2: Bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Step 3: Alcoholic KOH elimination gives propyne (C), a flammable gas. Step 4: Passing C over hot iron trimerizes acetylene (formed by cracking C) to benzene (D). Step 5: Benzene nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) gives nitrobenzene (E). Step 6: Reduction (Fe/HCl) gives aniline (F), used in dyes. Step 7: Aniline diazotization (HNO2) gives diazonium salt (G). Step 8: G + NaOH yields phenol (H), which gives a violet color with FeCl3. Now evaluate statements: 1) D (benzene) has 6 equivalent H, giving one singlet, not two\u2014incorrect. 2) F (aniline) used for dyes\u2014correct. 3) H (phenol) gives violet, not yellow, with FeCl3\u2014also incorrect in literal color\u2014but the primary wrong statement as given is about D\u2019s NMR. 4) C is a flammable gas\u2014correct. Thus the intended incorrect choice is A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
