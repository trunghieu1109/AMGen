Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Step 1: A (C3H6) is propene. Step 2: Bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Step 3: Alcoholic KOH elimination gives propyne (C), a flammable gas. Step 4: Passing C over hot iron trimerizes acetylene (formed by cracking C) to benzene (D). Step 5: Benzene nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) gives nitrobenzene (E). Step 6: Reduction (Fe/HCl) gives aniline (F), used in dyes. Step 7: Aniline diazotization (HNO2) gives diazonium salt (G). Step 8: G + NaOH yields phenol (H), which gives a violet color with FeCl3. Now evaluate statements: 1) D (benzene) has 6 equivalent H, giving one singlet, not two—incorrect. 2) F (aniline) used for dyes—correct. 3) H (phenol) gives violet, not yellow, with FeCl3—also incorrect in literal color—but the primary wrong statement as given is about D’s NMR. 4) C is a flammable gas—correct. Thus the intended incorrect choice is A).
