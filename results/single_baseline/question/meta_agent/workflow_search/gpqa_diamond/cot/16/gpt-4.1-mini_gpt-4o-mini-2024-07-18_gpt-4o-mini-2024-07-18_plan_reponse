        "response": "To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA. The reaction can be represented as: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc Ca-EDTA. The equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA is given by KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we can assume that at equilibrium, the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca^2+] can be calculated using the equilibrium expression. Since the concentration of EDTA is also related to the concentration of the complex, we can set up the equation and solve for [Ca^2+]. After substituting the values and solving, we find that the concentration of calcium ions is 1.0x10^-2 M, which corresponds to choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A",
