Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA. The reaction can be represented as: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA. The equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA is given by KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we can assume that at equilibrium, the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca^2+] can be calculated using the equilibrium expression. Since the concentration of EDTA is also related to the concentration of the complex, we can set up the equation and solve for [Ca^2+]. After substituting the values and solving, we find that the concentration of calcium ions is 1.0x10^-2 M, which corresponds to choice 1.
