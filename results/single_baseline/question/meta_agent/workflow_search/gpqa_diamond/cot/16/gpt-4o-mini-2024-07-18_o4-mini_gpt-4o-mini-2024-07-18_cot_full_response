Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Vr9h', content='We have CaEDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4–, formation constant Kf=[CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–])=5×10^10. Start with 0.02 M CaEDTA; let x=[Ca2+]=[EDTA4–] at equilibrium, so [CaEDTA]=0.02−x. Then (0.02−x)/(x^2)=5×10^10 ⇒ 5×10^10 x^2 + x − 0.02 = 0. Solve: x = [−1 + √(1 + 4·5×10^10·0.02)]/(2·5×10^10) ≈ 6.3×10^−7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
