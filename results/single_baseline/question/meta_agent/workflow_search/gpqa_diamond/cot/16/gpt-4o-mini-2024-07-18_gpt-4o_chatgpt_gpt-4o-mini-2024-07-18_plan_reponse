        "response": "To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is: Ca-EDTA \u21cc Ca\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. If the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we can set up an equilibrium expression: KCa-EDTA = [Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]/[Ca-EDTA]. At equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2\u207a ions. Then [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Plugging these into the equilibrium expression gives: 5x10^10 = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x). Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. Thus, 5x10^10 \u2248 x\u00b2/0.02. Solving for x gives x\u00b2 = 5x10^10 * 0.02 = 1x10^9, so x = sqrt(1x10^9) = 3.16x10^4. However, this is incorrect as it should be much smaller. Re-evaluating, we find that x = sqrt(1x10^-12) = 1x10^-6.3, which is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)",
