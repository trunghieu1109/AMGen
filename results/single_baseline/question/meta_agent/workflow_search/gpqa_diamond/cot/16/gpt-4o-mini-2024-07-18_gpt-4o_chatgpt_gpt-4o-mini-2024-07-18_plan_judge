Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. If the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we can set up an equilibrium expression: KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA]. At equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Then [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Plugging these into the equilibrium expression gives: 5x10^10 = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x). Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Thus, 5x10^10 ≈ x²/0.02. Solving for x gives x² = 5x10^10 * 0.02 = 1x10^9, so x = sqrt(1x10^9) = 3.16x10^4. However, this is incorrect as it should be much smaller. Re-evaluating, we find that x = sqrt(1x10^-12) = 1x10^-6.3, which is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.
