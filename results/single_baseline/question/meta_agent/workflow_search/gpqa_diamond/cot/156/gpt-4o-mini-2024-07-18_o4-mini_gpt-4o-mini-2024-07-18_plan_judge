Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, you must first identify the viral genome. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so you reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA and sequence it to identify unique viral sequences. Next, you develop a real-time (quantitative) PCR assay targeting those sequences for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection. This approach is faster and more accurate than antibody-based assays or symptom-based design and more appropriate than nested PCR, given the need for high throughput and quantitation.
