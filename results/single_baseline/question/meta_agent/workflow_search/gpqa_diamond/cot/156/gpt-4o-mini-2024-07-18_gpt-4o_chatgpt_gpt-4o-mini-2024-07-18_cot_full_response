Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Tb2l', content='To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, the most appropriate approach is to identify the viral genetic material. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so the first step is to convert the RNA into cDNA using reverse transcription. Once you have the cDNA, you can sequence it to identify the virus. After identifying the virus, you can design specific primers and probes for a real-time PCR kit, which allows for quick and accurate detection of the viral genetic material in patient samples. This approach is more direct and specific than antibody detection methods, which may not be as immediate or specific for early detection.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
