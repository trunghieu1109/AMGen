proposed answer: To synthesize [1,1'-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one from 1,5-dichloropentane, we need to first form a cyclopentane ring, then introduce a double bond to form cyclopentylidene, and finally oxidize to form the ketone. The correct sequence of reagents should first involve a dehalogenation to form the cyclopentane, followed by halogenation to introduce a double bond, then dehydrohalogenation to form the cyclopentylidene, and finally oxidation to form the ketone. Choice 1 seems to follow this logic: Zn in ether for dehalogenation, Cl2/hv for halogenation, aq. KOH for dehydrohalogenation, and pyridine + CrO3 + HCl for oxidation.
