        "response": "In a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, the reactants are typically a diene and a dienophile. Here, 2,5-dimethylthiophene acts as the diene and Furan-2,5-dione acts as the dienophile. The reaction is expected to yield a product that retains the stereochemistry of the reactants. The options provided are stereoisomers of a tetrahydro compound. To determine the correct product, we need to consider the stereochemistry and the nature of the substituents. The correct product should reflect the exo addition characteristic of the reaction. After analyzing the options, the correct product is identified as the one that matches the expected stereochemistry and structure resulting from the reaction.\n\nAnswer:C",
