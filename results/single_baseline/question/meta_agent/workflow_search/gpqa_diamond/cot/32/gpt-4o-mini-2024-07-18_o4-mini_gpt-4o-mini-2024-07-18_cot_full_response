Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UPac', content='The reaction is a Dielsâ€“Alder between 2,5-dimethylthiophene (diene) and furan-2,5-dione (dienophile). The exo adduct places the two methyl groups exo to the newly formed bridge. Matching stereochemistry and naming identifies choice 3 as the exo product.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
