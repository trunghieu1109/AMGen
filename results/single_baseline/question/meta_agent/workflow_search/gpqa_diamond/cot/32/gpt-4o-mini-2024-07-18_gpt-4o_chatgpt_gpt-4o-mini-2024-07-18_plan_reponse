        "response": "In a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction, a diene reacts with a dienophile to form a cyclohexene derivative. The reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione involves the diene 2,5-dimethylthiophene and the dienophile furan-2,5-dione. The exo product is typically favored in Diels-Alder reactions due to steric and electronic factors. The exo product will have the substituents on the newly formed ring pointing away from the largest bridge. In this case, the exo product will have the oxygen from the furan-2,5-dione pointing away from the sulfur in the thiophene. This corresponds to the structure where the oxygen is exo to the sulfur bridge, which is choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
