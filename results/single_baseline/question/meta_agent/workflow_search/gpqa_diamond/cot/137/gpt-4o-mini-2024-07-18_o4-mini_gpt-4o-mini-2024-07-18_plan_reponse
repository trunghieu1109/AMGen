            "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ",
            "The increased pressure of the solution",
            "The increased volume of the solution ",
            "The increased temperature of the solution",

        "correct_answer": 4,
        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The reaction is acid\u2010catalyzed (pH 1 high [H+]). Addition of the unknown substance caused an exothermic reaction (temperature rose) but also raised the pH from 1 to 4, lowering [H+]. A higher temperature would speed up kinetics, but the observed rate slowed, so the dominant effect is reduced acid concentration. Therefore, the increased pH is responsible for the slower rate.\n\nAnswer:D",
