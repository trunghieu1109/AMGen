Question: Example(question='A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ', choice1='The increased pressure of the solution', choice2='The increased volume of the solution ', choice3='The increased temperature of the solution', choice4='The increased pH of the solution', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction was initially proceeding at pH 1, which means it was in a highly acidic environment. The accidental addition of an unknown substance changed the pH to 4, which is less acidic. The rate of reaction for many reactions involving H+ ions can be dependent on the concentration of H+ ions. By increasing the pH from 1 to 4, the concentration of H+ ions decreased significantly, which could slow down the rate of reaction if the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of H+ ions. The exothermic nature of the reaction caused the container to get hot, but the key factor affecting the rate of reaction is the change in pH, not the temperature increase. Therefore, the increased pH of the solution is the most likely reason for the change in the rate of reaction.
