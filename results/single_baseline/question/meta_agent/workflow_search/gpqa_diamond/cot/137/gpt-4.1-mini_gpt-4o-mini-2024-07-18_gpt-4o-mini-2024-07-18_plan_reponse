            "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ",
            "The increased pressure of the solution",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The reaction was initially at pH 1, which indicates a high concentration of H+ ions. When the unknown substance was added, the pH increased to 4, meaning the concentration of H+ ions decreased significantly. This decrease in H+ concentration would slow down the reaction rate, especially if the reaction is dependent on the availability of H+ ions. The fact that the container got hot indicates that the reaction is exothermic, but the key factor affecting the rate of reaction here is the change in pH, which corresponds to a decrease in H+ concentration. Therefore, the most relevant choice is the increased pH of the solution, which directly relates to the decrease in H+ concentration and the slowing of the reaction rate.\n\nAnswer:D",
