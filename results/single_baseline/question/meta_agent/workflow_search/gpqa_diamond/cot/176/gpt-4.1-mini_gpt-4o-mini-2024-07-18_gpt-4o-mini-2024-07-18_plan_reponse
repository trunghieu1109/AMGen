            "Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:",

        "response": "To find the luminosity of the stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the surface area (A) of the star. The surface area of a star is given by A = 4\u03c0R\u00b2, where R is the radius of the star. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we can express the surface areas as A1 = 4\u03c0(1.5R)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0(2.25R\u00b2) = 2.25A2. The luminosity ratio can be expressed as L1/L2 = (A1 * T1\u2074) / (A2 * T2\u2074). Given that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths, we can assume they have similar temperatures, thus T1 \u2248 T2. Therefore, the luminosity ratio simplifies to L1/L2 \u2248 2.25. Hence, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\nAnswer:A",
