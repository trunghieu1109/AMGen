Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Given R1/R2 = 1.5 and both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, but Star_2 is receding at v = 700 km/s so its rest‐frame peak wavelength is λ_rest2 = λ_obs/(1+v/c). By Wien’s law, T ∝ 1/λ_rest, so T2 = T1*(1+v/c). Luminosity L ∝ R^2 T^4, hence L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2*(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2/(1+v/c)^4 ≈ 2.25/(1.00233)^4 ≈ 2.23.
