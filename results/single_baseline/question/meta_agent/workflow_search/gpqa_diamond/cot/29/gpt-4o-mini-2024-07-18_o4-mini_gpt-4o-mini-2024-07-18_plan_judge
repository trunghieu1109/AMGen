Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, convert the emitted‐energy E=2.3393 eV to wavelength λ via λ=1240 eV·nm/E≈1240/2.3393≈530 nm, which lies in the green region of the visible spectrum. The dye therefore absorbs light of that wavelength (green). Of the given choices, the closest is yellow (B).

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 3
