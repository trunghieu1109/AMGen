        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "First, convert the emitted\u2010energy E=2.3393\u2009eV to wavelength \u03bb via \u03bb=1240\u2009eV\u00b7nm/E\u22481240/2.3393\u2248530\u2009nm, which lies in the green region of the visible spectrum. The dye therefore absorbs light of that wavelength (green). Of the given choices, the closest is yellow (B).\n\nAnswer:B",
