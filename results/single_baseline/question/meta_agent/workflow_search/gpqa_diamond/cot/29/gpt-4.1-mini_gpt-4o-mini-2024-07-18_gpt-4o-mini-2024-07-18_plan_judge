Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The energy of the absorbed light can be calculated using the relationship between energy and wavelength. The energy of light is inversely proportional to its wavelength. Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths, which means that if the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, it absorbs light of a lower energy. The visible spectrum ranges from about 1.65 eV (red) to about 3.1 eV (violet). Since 2.3393 eV is closer to the blue region of the spectrum, the dye would absorb light in the complementary color to the emitted light. The color that corresponds to this energy is in the yellow range, as yellow is complementary to blue. Therefore, the color absorbed by the organic compound is yellow.

Answer:Yellow
Extracted answer: Yellow
Correct answer: 3
