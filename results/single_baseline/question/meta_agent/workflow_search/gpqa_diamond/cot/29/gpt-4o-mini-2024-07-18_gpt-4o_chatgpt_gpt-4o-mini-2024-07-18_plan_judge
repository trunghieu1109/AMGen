Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. To find the color of light absorbed, we need to consider the complementary color of the emitted light. The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength in the visible spectrum. Using the formula E = hc/Î», where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light, we can find the wavelength of the emitted light. The complementary color of the emitted light is the color absorbed. Typically, if a dye emits light in the red region, it absorbs in the green region, and vice versa. Similarly, if it emits in the blue region, it absorbs in the yellow region, and vice versa. Given the energy, 2.3393 eV is likely in the red region, so the absorbed color is green, which corresponds to the choice 'Yellow'.
