Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sUdM', content='First, convert the emitted‐energy E=2.3393\u2009eV to wavelength λ via λ=1240\u2009eV·nm/E≈1240/2.3393≈530\u2009nm, which lies in the green region of the visible spectrum. The dye therefore absorbs light of that wavelength (green). Of the given choices, the closest is yellow (B).\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
