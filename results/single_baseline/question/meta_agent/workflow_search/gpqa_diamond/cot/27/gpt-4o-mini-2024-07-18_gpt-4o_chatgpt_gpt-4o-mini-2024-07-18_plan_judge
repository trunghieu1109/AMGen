Question: Example(question='S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice2='(2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice3="(1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol", choice4='(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The sequence of reactions involves several steps. First, the silyl protection of the hydroxyl group occurs with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, protecting the alcohol. Then, Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl group to the enone, and benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group, likely through a nucleophilic substitution. The LDA and iodomethane step introduces a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation. Finally, the aqueous HCl removes the silyl protecting group, revealing the alcohol. The stereochemistry is determined by the original configuration and the stereospecificity of the reactions. The final product should have the hydroxyl group deprotected and the added groups in the correct stereochemistry.
