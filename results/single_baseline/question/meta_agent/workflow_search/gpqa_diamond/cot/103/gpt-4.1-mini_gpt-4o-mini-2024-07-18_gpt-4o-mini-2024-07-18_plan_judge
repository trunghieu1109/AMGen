Question: Example(question='Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', choice1='~ 0.36', choice2='~ 1.40', choice3='~ 1.96', choice4='~ 0.85', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can use the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) method and the orbital period. The amplitude of the periodic shift in the spectral line is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) is given by K = (2Ï€G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)), where P is the orbital period, M_p is the mass of the planet, M_star is the mass of the star, and G is the gravitational constant. Since both stars have similar masses and both planets have similar masses, we can compare the shifts directly. The ratio of the shifts gives us a ratio of the orbital periods. If planet #1 has a shift of 5 miliangstrom and planet #2 has a shift of 7 miliangstrom, we can set up the ratio: P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^(3/2). Therefore, P2/P1 = (5/7)^(3/2). Calculating this gives us approximately 1.40, which corresponds to choice 2.
