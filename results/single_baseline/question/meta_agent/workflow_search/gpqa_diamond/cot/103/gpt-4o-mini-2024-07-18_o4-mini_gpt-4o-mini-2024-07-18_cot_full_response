Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', 'choice1': '~ 0.36', 'choice2': '~ 1.40', 'choice3': '~ 1.96', 'choice4': '~ 0.85'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent I8VJ', content='To compare orbital periods using RV semi‐amplitudes K: for circular orbits around identical stars with identical planet masses, K ∝P^(−1/3). Thus K2/K1=(P2/P1)^(−1/3) ⇒P2/P1=(K2/K1)^(−3). Here K2/K1=7/5=1.4, so P2/P1=1.4^(−3)=1/2.744≈0.36.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
