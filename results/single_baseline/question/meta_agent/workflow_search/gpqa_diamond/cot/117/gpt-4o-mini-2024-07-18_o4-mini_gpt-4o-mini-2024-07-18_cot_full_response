Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UlIA', content='The reaction is addition of Br2 across the C1–C2 double bond of the enol, giving a vicinal dibromide on the cyclopentanol. Anti addition to the cis‐planar enol leads to trans‐1,2‐dibromide, i.e. (1R,2S) configuration.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
