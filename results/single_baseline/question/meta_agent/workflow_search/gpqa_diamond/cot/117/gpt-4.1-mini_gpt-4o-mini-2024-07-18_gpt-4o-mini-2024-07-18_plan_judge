Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine typically involves the addition of bromine across the double bond of the enol. This results in the formation of a dibrominated product. The stereochemistry of the product will depend on the specific conditions of the reaction, but generally, the major outcome will be a dibrominated alcohol. The options provided include various dibromo and bromo derivatives. The most likely major product from the reaction is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, as it reflects the addition of bromine across the double bond in a stereospecific manner.
