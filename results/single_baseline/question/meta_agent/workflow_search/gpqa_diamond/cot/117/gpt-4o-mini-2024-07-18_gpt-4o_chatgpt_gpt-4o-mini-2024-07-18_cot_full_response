Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IA6k', content='The reaction between an alkene and bromine typically results in the addition of bromine across the double bond. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added, it will add across this double bond, resulting in a dibromo compound. The enol group (OH) is not directly involved in the bromination of the double bond. Therefore, the major product will be a dibromo compound. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, leading to a trans product. Therefore, the major outcome is likely to be a dibromo compound with trans stereochemistry.\n\nAnswer:B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
