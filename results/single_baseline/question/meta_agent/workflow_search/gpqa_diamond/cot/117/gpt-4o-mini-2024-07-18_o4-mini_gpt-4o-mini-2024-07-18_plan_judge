Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction is addition of Br2 across the C1–C2 double bond of the enol, giving a vicinal dibromide on the cyclopentanol. Anti addition to the cis‐planar enol leads to trans‐1,2‐dibromide, i.e. (1R,2S) configuration.
