Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction between an alkene and bromine typically results in the addition of bromine across the double bond. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added, it will add across this double bond, resulting in a dibromo compound. The enol group (OH) is not directly involved in the bromination of the double bond. Therefore, the major product will be a dibromo compound. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, leading to a trans product. Therefore, the major outcome is likely to be a dibromo compound with trans stereochemistry.

Answer:B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol
Extracted answer: B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol
Correct answer: 1
