Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fBw6', content='The potential in Cartesian coords is V = 1/2\u2009k\u2009y^2 + 2\u2009k\u2009x^2, i.e. an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m). The energy levels are E = ℏω_x(n_x+1/2) + ℏω_y(n_y+1/2) = ℏ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2).
