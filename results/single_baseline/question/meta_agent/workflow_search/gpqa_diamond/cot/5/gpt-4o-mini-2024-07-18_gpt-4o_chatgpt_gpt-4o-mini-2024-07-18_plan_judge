Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The given potential V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) can be separated into radial and angular parts. The radial part is a harmonic oscillator potential, and the angular part involves cos^2(θ), which suggests a coupling between radial and angular motion. The energy levels of a 2D harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_r + n_θ + 1)ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). The potential suggests a modification to the standard 2D harmonic oscillator due to the angular dependence. The energy spectrum will depend on the quantum numbers associated with the radial and angular parts. The correct choice should reflect the modified energy levels due to the potential's form.
