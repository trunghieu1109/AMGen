        "response": "To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle in a given potential, we need to analyze the potential and identify the quantum numbers associated with the system. The potential given is a combination of a harmonic oscillator potential and an angular dependence. The energy levels for such systems can often be expressed in terms of quantum numbers. The choices provided suggest different combinations of quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which correspond to the modes of oscillation in the x and y directions. We need to determine which expression correctly represents the energy levels based on the potential provided.\n\nAnswer:E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)\u210f*sqrt(k/m)",
