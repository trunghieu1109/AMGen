    <pre>We need to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism (chirality). 
1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate is an ortho-substituted biphenyl locked into a chiral, non-planar conformation (axial chirality). 
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the hydroxyl‐bearing carbon. 
3. Benzophenone is achiral (sp2 carbonyl carbon, free rotation). 
4. Dimethyl fumarate is a planar trans‐alkene, achiral. 
Thus only 1 and 2 are optically active, corresponding to choice2 which is B).
