Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Optical isomerism occurs in compounds that have chiral centers, meaning they have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound has a biphenyl structure which can exhibit chirality if the two phenyl rings are not coplanar and have substituents that create a chiral axis. It is possible for this compound to show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon with the hydroxy group), making it capable of optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers or chiral axes, so it does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is a trans isomer of an alkene, and while it can have geometric isomerism, it does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.

Based on this analysis, compounds 1 and 2 can show optical isomerism.
