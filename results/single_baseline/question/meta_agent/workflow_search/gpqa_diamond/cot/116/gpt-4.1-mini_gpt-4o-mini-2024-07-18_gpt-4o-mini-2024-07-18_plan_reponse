            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or if they can exist as non-superimposable mirror images. Optical isomerism is typically associated with compounds that have at least one chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate - This compound has multiple substituents and can potentially have chiral centers depending on the arrangement of the nitro and carboxylate groups.\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate - This compound has a chiral center at the carbon with the hydroxyl group, thus it can show optical isomerism.\n3. Benzophenone - This compound does not have a chiral center and cannot show optical isomerism.\n4. Dimethyl fumarate - This compound has a double bond and can exist in two geometric isomers (cis and trans), but it does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is the choice that includes compound 2 and excludes the others that do not show optical isomerism.\n\nAnswer:2 and 3",
