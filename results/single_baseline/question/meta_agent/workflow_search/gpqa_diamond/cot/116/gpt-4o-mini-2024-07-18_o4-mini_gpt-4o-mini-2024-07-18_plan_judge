Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism (chirality). 
1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is an ortho-substituted biphenyl locked into a chiral, non-planar conformation (axial chirality). 
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the hydroxyl‐bearing carbon. 
3. Benzophenone is achiral (sp2 carbonyl carbon, free rotation). 
4. Dimethyl fumarate is a planar trans‐alkene, achiral. 
Thus only 1 and 2 are optically active, corresponding to choice2 which is B).
