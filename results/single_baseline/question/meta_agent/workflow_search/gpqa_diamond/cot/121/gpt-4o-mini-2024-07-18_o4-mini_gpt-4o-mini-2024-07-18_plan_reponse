            "acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)",

        "response": "First, the sequence is: 1) Hell\u2013Volhard\u2013Zelinsky bromination of acetic acid \u2192 \u03b1-bromoacetic acid, 2) Fischer esterification with EtOH \u2192 ethyl bromoacetate, 3) SN2 with CN\u207b \u2192 ethyl cyanoacetate, 4) deprotonation + intramolecular cyclization via 1,5-dibromopentane \u2192 a cyclohexane ring bearing an \u2013CN and an \u2013CO\u2082Et on one carbon. That product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nIn that cyclohexane, rapid chair\u2010flip averaging gives equivalence between C2\u2013C6 environments: C2 and C6 are equivalent, C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 is unique (3 CH\u2082 signals). The ethyl ester contributes 1 CH\u2082 and 1 CH\u2083 signal. Total distinct \u00b9H signals = 3 (ring CH\u2082) + 1 (OCH\u2082) + 1 (CH\u2083) = 5.\n\nAnswer:C)",
