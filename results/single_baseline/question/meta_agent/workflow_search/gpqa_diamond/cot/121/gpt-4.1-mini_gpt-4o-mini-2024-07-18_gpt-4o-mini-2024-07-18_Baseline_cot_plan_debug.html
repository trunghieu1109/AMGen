    <pre>To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4, we need to analyze the structure of the final product based on the reactions described. Each step modifies the molecule, and we need to consider the symmetry and the environment of the hydrogen atoms in the final product. After considering the transformations and the final structure, we can count the distinct hydrogen environments.
