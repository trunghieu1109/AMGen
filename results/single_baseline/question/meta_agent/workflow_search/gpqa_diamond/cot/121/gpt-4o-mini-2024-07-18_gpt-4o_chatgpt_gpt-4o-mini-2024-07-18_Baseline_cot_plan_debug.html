    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the reaction sequence step by step. First, acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, which is a known method to form bromoacetic acid. Upon heating with ethanol and sulfuric acid, this bromoacetic acid undergoes esterification to form ethyl bromoacetate. Treating ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide results in the substitution of the bromine with a cyano group, forming ethyl cyanoacetate. Next, ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. This step likely involves deprotonation of the methylene group between the ester and the cyano group, followed by alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to a cyclic product. The final product is likely a cyclized compound with a new ring formed. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, we need to consider the symmetry and chemical environment of the hydrogens in the final product. The final product is likely a cyclic compound with several distinct environments for the hydrogens. After considering the possible structure, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10.
