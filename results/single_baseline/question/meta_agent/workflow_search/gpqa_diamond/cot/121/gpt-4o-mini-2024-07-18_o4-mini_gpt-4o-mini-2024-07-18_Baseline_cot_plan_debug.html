    <pre>First, the sequence is: 1) Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky bromination of acetic acid → α-bromoacetic acid, 2) Fischer esterification with EtOH → ethyl bromoacetate, 3) SN2 with CN⁻ → ethyl cyanoacetate, 4) deprotonation + intramolecular cyclization via 1,5-dibromopentane → a cyclohexane ring bearing an –CN and an –CO₂Et on one carbon. That product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.

In that cyclohexane, rapid chair‐flip averaging gives equivalence between C2–C6 environments: C2 and C6 are equivalent, C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 is unique (3 CH₂ signals). The ethyl ester contributes 1 CH₂ and 1 CH₃ signal. Total distinct ¹H signals = 3 (ring CH₂) + 1 (OCH₂) + 1 (CH₃) = 5.
