Question: Example(question='acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)', choice1='12', choice2='10', choice3='5', choice4='8', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, the sequence is: 1) Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky bromination of acetic acid → α-bromoacetic acid, 2) Fischer esterification with EtOH → ethyl bromoacetate, 3) SN2 with CN⁻ → ethyl cyanoacetate, 4) deprotonation + intramolecular cyclization via 1,5-dibromopentane → a cyclohexane ring bearing an –CN and an –CO₂Et on one carbon. That product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.

In that cyclohexane, rapid chair‐flip averaging gives equivalence between C2–C6 environments: C2 and C6 are equivalent, C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 is unique (3 CH₂ signals). The ethyl ester contributes 1 CH₂ and 1 CH₃ signal. Total distinct ¹H signals = 3 (ring CH₂) + 1 (OCH₂) + 1 (CH₃) = 5.
