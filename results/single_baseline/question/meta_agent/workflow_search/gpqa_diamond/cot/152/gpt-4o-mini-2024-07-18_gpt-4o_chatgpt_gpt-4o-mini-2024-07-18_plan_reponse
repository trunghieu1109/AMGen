            "\u03b1-\u03b2 unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

            "A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze each Michael addition reaction and determine the products. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the \u03b2 position of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, resulting in a Michael addition product. The presence of NaOEt and EtOH suggests the formation of an enolate from dimethyl malonate, which then attacks the \u03b2-carbon of the acrylate. The product is likely trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as the nucleophile and attacks the \u03b2 position of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The conditions (MeOH, H3O+) suggest a Michael addition followed by possible tautomerization or hydrolysis, leading to 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For reaction (C), the nucleophile is likely cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which attacks the \u03b2 position of but-3-en-2-one. The conditions (KOH, H2O) suggest a Michael addition, resulting in 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that matches these products.\n\nAnswer:A)",
