            "\u03b1-\u03b2 unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione",
            "A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione",
            "A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione",
            "A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione",
            "A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "For reaction A, malonate enolate adds to the \u03b2\u2010carbon of methyl p-tolylacrylate to give a geminal diester at C1, the original ester at C3, and a p-tolyl substituent at C2: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For reaction B, the enamine adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile and on hydrolysis yields the ketone: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Reaction C is then cyclohexane-1,3-dione undergoing Michael addition with methyl vinyl ketone to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. These correspond to choice 4 (D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
