    <pre>To identify the reactants for the given name reactions, we need to analyze the transformations described. For the first reaction, A + H2SO4 ---&gt; 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one, we are looking for a reactant A that can be converted into a ketone with the given structure upon treatment with sulfuric acid. This suggests a dehydration reaction of an alcohol to form a ketone. Therefore, A is likely an alcohol with a similar structure to the product. For the second reaction, B + BuLi + H+ ---&gt; 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, we are looking for a reactant B that can be converted into an alcohol with the given structure upon treatment with butyllithium and acid. This suggests a reaction involving a carbonyl compound that undergoes addition to form an alcohol. Therefore, B is likely a ketone or aldehyde with a similar structure to the product. Analyzing the choices, choice 3 matches these criteria: A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol (an alcohol that can be dehydrated to the ketone) and B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one (a ketone that can be converted to the alcohol).
