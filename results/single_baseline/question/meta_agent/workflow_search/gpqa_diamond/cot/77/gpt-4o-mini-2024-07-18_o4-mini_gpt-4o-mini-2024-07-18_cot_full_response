Question: {'question': 'Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZGwC', content='We recognize the required expressions as the Liénard–Wiechert potentials in SI units for a moving point charge. The scalar potential is V = qc/[4π ε₀ (d c – d·v)] and the vector potential is A = μ₀ q c v/[4π (d c – d·v)], which also satisfies A = (v/c²) V.
