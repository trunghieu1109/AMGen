Question: Example(question='Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.', choice1='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n', choice2='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}', choice3='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n', choice4='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge, we need to consider the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials. The correct expressions for the potentials depend on the position vector and the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The choices provided include different forms of these potentials. The correct form typically involves the distance to the observation point and the velocity of the charge, taking into account the effects of special relativity.

Answer:The correct expressions for the scalar potential and vector potential at time t and position r for a moving charge are given by choice 2: V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}
