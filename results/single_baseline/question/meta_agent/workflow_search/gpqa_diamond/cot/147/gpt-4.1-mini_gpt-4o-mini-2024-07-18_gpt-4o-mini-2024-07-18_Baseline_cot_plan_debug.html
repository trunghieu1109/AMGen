    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (É·F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;220-240&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;140-160&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;160-180&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;110-130&#39;}

    <pre>To determine the range of the molecular weight of substance A4, we need to analyze the information given about the compounds and their interactions. The compounds involve fluorine and an element Y, and we know that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, with A2 having a specific fluorine weight percentage. The interactions with xenon and the formation of A5 from A4 suggest that A4 is a significant compound in this series. Given the choices provided, we can infer that the molecular weight of A4 is likely to be in the range of 220-240, as it is a compound that interacts with other elements and is involved in the formation of other substances. Therefore, the most reasonable choice based on the context is choice 1.
