Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We identify A2’s fluorine mass fraction (ωF=31.96%) with YF3, giving M_Y≈121.8 → Y=Sb. Sb forms five binary fluorides SbF, SbF2, SbF3, SbF4, SbF5. A3 (highest) = SbF5. A1 (bright red that oxidizes Xe) = SbF4, A2 = SbF3, A3 = SbF5. The remaining A4 must be SbF2 whose molar mass is 121.8+2·19=159.8 g/mol, which lies in the 140–160 range.
