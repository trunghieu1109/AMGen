    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to identify the element Y and the compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. The key information is that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, and A5 is obtained by adding Y to a solution of A4. A5 decomposes in water. The decomposition of A1 suggests it is a higher fluoride of Y, and A2 is a lower fluoride. The oxidation of xenon suggests Y is a strong oxidizer, likely a transition metal or a heavy p-block element. The fluorine content of A2 (31.96%) can help identify its formula. A3 is likely a simple fluoride of Y. A4 is a compound that can form A5 with Y, and A5 decomposes in water, suggesting it might be a complex fluoride or oxyfluoride. The molecular weight range of A4 is asked, so we need to deduce its formula. Based on the given choices, we can estimate the molecular weight of A4. If we assume Y is a heavy element like iodine, then A4 could be IF7, which has a molecular weight of 234.9, falling in the range 220-240.
