Question: Example(question='Determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis.', choice1='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene', choice2='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene', choice3='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', choice4='4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To form a cyclohexene from an octadiene by ring‐closing metathesis, the two alkenes must be terminal (positions 1 and 7) so that closing gives a six-membered ring. Numbering the target cyclohexene with the double bond at C1–C2, substituents at ring positions 3, 4, and 5 map to chain substituents at C3, C4, and C5 of an octa-1,7-diene. Thus we need 3,4-dimethyl at chain C3 and C4 and isopropyl at chain C5. This corresponds to choice C.
