        "response": "To form a cyclohexene from an octadiene by ring\u2010closing metathesis, the two alkenes must be terminal (positions 1 and 7) so that closing gives a six-membered ring. Numbering the target cyclohexene with the double bond at C1\u2013C2, substituents at ring positions 3, 4, and 5 map to chain substituents at C3, C4, and C5 of an octa-1,7-diene. Thus we need 3,4-dimethyl at chain C3 and C4 and isopropyl at chain C5. This corresponds to choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
