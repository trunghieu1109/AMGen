Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

    <pre>To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to calculate the apparent V magnitudes of the stars based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. The formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) is: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). We will apply this formula to each star and then check if their apparent magnitudes are within the limits for both ESPRESSO (brighter than 17 mag) and HIRES (brighter than 16 mag). 

1. **Star1**: Absolute V magnitude = 15.5 mag, distance = 10 pc. 
   m = 15.5 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15.5 + 5 * (1 - 1) = 15.5 (apparent magnitude). 
   - ESPRESSO: Yes, HIRES: Yes.

2. **Star2**: Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. 
   - ESPRESSO: Yes, HIRES: Yes.

3. **Star3**: Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag. 
   - ESPRESSO: Yes, HIRES: Yes.

4. **Star4**: Absolute V magnitude = 15.5 mag, distance = 10 pc. 
   m = 15.5 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15.5 (apparent magnitude). 
   - ESPRESSO: Yes, HIRES: Yes.

5. **Star5**: Absolute V magnitude = 16.5 mag, distance = 5 pc. 
   m = 16.5 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699 - 1) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 (apparent magnitude). 
   - ESPRESSO: Yes, HIRES: Yes.

Now we check the choices:
- **Choice1**: Star1 and Star4 - Both can be detected.
- **Choice2**: Star4 and Star5 - Both can be detected.
- **Choice3**: Star2 and Star3 - Both can be detected.
- **Choice4**: Star3 and Star5 - Both can be detected.

Since all stars can be detected by both instruments, the answer is that multiple pairs can be detected. However, the question asks for which specific stars can be detected together, and all pairs listed can be detected. Therefore, the answer is complete with the pairs that can be detected together.

Answer:Star1 and Star4, Star4 and Star5, Star2 and Star3, Star3 and Star5</pre>
