Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

    <pre>To determine which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, we need to calculate the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and check if they are within the detection limits of both spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag.

1. Star1: Given absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag and distance is 10 pc. Using the distance modulus formula, apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 17 mag and 16 mag, so it can be observed by both.

2. Star2: Given apparent V magnitude is 16.5 mag. This is brighter than 17 mag but not brighter than 16 mag, so it cannot be observed by HIRES.

3. Star3: Given apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag and E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. Total absorption in V band = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. Corrected apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag. This is not brighter than 17 mag, so it cannot be observed by ESPRESSO.

4. Star4: Given absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag, distance is 10 pc, and E(B-V) = 0.4 mag. Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 mag. Total absorption in V band = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. Corrected apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag. This is brighter than 17 mag and 16 mag, so it can be observed by both.

5. Star5: Given absolute V magnitude is 16.5 mag and distance is 5 pc. Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 - 5 * 0.3010 = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag. This is brighter than 17 mag and 16 mag, so it can be observed by both.

Stars that can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star1, Star4, and Star5. The choices that include these stars are &#39;Star1 and Star4&#39; and &#39;Star4 and Star5&#39;.
