        "response": "To identify the compound, we analyze the provided spectral data. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 indicates a possible isotopic pattern, likely due to the presence of chlorine (which has isotopes at m/z = 35 and 37). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicating the presence of an -OH group, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is typical for an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, which suggest aromatic protons. Given these clues, the compound is likely a chlorobenzoic acid. Among the choices, 2-chlorobenzoic acid fits the molecular weight and the spectral data best, as it has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine substituent on the aromatic ring.\n\nAnswer:B",
