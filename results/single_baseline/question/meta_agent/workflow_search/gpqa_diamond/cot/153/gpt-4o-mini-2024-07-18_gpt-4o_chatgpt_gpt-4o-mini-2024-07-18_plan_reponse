        "response": "The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a significant peak at m/z = 158, suggesting the presence of a chlorine atom due to the characteristic isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicating a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, which suggest an aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons, likely para-substituted. Based on this information, the compound is likely a chlorobenzoic acid. The para-substitution pattern and the presence of a carboxylic acid group match 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nAnswer:A)",
