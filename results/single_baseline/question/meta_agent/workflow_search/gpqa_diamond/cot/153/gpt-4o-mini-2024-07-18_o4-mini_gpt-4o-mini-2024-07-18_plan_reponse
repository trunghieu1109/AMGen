        "response": "First, the molecular ion peaks at m/z 156 and 158 in a ~3:1 ratio indicate one chlorine atom in the molecule (35Cl and 37Cl isotopes). The molecular weight (~156) fits C7H5ClO2. The IR shows a broad 3500\u20132700 cm\u207b\u00b9 band plus a strong 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak, diagnostic for a carboxylic acid (O\u2013H broad stretch and C=O). The \u00b9H NMR shows a 11.0 ppm singlet (1H) for the CO2H proton, and two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid has a para pattern (two equivalent pairs of aromatic H\u2019s) and the correct MW/Cl isotopic pattern.\n\nAnswer:A)",
