Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, the molecular ion peaks at m/z 156 and 158 in a ~3:1 ratio indicate one chlorine atom in the molecule (35Cl and 37Cl isotopes). The molecular weight (~156) fits C7H5ClO2. The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band plus a strong 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, diagnostic for a carboxylic acid (O–H broad stretch and C=O). The ¹H NMR shows a 11.0 ppm singlet (1H) for the CO2H proton, and two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid has a para pattern (two equivalent pairs of aromatic H’s) and the correct MW/Cl isotopic pattern.
