Question: Example(question='Consider this density matrix\n\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nWhat is its geometrical position in the qubits space?', choice1='r=(0,0,0)', choice2='r=(1,1,1)', choice3='r=(0,0,1)', choice4='r=(1,1,0)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The given state ρ = ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is the maximally mixed state, which in the Bloch sphere representation is ρ = ½(I + r·σ) with r = 0. Thus its Bloch vector is (0,0,0).
