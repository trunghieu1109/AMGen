This is the density matrix for a completely mixed state, which is represented by the Bloch vector \\( \\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \\) in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector for a density matrix \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\sigma) \\) is zero for a completely mixed state, where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix and \\( \\sigma \\) are the Pauli matrices. Therefore, the geometrical position in the qubits space is \\( r = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\nAnswer:A)",
