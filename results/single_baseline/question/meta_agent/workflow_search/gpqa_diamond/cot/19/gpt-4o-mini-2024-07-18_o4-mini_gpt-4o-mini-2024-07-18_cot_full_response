Question: {'question': 'A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?\n\n1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.', 'choice1': '2,3,4', 'choice2': '1,3,4', 'choice3': '1,2,3', 'choice4': '1,2,4'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rU4K', content='The impulse approximation assumes the probe interacts with a single nucleon (assumption 1), that there are no interactions of the struck nucleon with the rest of the nucleus (nuclear transparency, assumption 2) and that the nucleon behaves as if unbound (no binding forces, assumption 4). The nonrelativistic treatment of the internal quarks (assumption 3) is not required for the impulse approximation. Thus the required assumptions are 1, 2, and 4, corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
