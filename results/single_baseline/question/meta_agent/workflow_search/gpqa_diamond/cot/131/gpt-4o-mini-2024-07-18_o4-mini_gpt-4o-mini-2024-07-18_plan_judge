Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need two C10H14 aromatics giving only two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three methyl singlets (2:1:1). Only symmetric tetramethylbenzenes give a single aromatic singlet (2 H). The symmetric isomers are 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Each gives two methyl environments (6 H each), so the four methyl sets from both overlap into three signals if one set coincides. Integration then is 12:6:6 = 2:1:1, matching the data.
