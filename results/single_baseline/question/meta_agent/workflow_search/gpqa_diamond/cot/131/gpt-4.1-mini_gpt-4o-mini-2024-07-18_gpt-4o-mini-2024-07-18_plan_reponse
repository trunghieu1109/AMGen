            "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.",

        "response": "The NMR spectrum indicates that there are two distinct aromatic compounds, each contributing two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, suggesting they have similar environments for their protons. The three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest that one compound has two equivalent protons and the other has one equivalent proton. Analyzing the given options, I need to identify which two compounds fit these criteria based on their structure and the expected NMR signals.\n\nAnswer:1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene",
