    <pre>The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating two aromatic protons in each compound. The three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest the presence of methyl groups. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons and three types of methyl groups (2:1:1 ratio). 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene also has two aromatic protons and three types of methyl groups (2:1:1 ratio). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four aromatic protons, which does not match the 1:1 ratio. 1,4-diethylbenzene has four aromatic protons and two types of ethyl groups, which does not match the observed signals. Therefore, the compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
