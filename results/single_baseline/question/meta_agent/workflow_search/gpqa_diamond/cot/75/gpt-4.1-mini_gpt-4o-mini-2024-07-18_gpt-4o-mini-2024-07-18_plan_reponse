            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",
            "green signal colocalizes with the red signal",
            "there is no green signal",
            "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
            "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal",

The TUNEL staining will indicate apoptotic cells with a green signal. The question asks what the first thing you notice is, which implies an observation that can be made immediately after the staining and imaging process. The options provided suggest different observations regarding the localization and presence of signals from the iPSCs and apoptotic cells.\n\nAnswer:A",
