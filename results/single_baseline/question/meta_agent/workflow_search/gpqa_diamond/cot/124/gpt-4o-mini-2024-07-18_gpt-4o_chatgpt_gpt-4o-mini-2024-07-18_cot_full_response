Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5Iw6', content='The problem describes a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the principal quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. The third excited state corresponds to n = 3. Therefore, the energy is E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. The degeneracy for n = 3 is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Thus, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
