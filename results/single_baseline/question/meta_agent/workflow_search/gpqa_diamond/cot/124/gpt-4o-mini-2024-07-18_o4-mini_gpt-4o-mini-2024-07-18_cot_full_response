Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent jO5I', content='The energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω, where N = 2n_r + ℓ. The ground state is N=0, the first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. Thus E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. The degeneracy is g(N) = (N+1)(N+2)/2 = 4·5/2 = 10.
