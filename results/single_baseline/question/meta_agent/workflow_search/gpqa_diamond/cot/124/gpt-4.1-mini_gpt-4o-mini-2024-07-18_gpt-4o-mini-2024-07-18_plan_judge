Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number. For the third excited state, n = 3, so E_3 = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue can be determined by the degeneracy of the energy level, which for a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by the formula (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, this gives (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that states the energy of the third excited state as (9/2) ħω and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions as 10.
