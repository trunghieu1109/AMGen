        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The substrate is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: a cyclohexene ring (one DU for the ring, one for the ring C=C), a vinyl substituent (one more DU), an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid. Red P/HI reduces both the \u2013CHO and \u2013COOH to \u2013CH2 and \u2013CH3, respectively, without touching the C=C bonds. The product therefore retains the ring (1 DU) plus two C=C bonds (two more DUs), for a total IHD = 3.\n\nAnswer:B)",
