Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent PxbB', content='The substrate is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: a cyclohexene ring (one DU for the ring, one for the ring C=C), a vinyl substituent (one more DU), an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid. Red P/HI reduces both the –CHO and –COOH to –CH2 and –CH3, respectively, without touching the C=C bonds. The product therefore retains the ring (1 DU) plus two C=C bonds (two more DUs), for a total IHD = 3.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
