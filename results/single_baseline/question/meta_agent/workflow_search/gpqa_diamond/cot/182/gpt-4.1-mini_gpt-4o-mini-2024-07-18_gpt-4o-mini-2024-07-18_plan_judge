Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product obtained from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we need to analyze the structure of the starting compound and the expected product. The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2, where C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, H is the number of hydrogens, and X is the number of halogens. The reaction with HI will likely lead to the saturation of double bonds and the addition of iodine, which will affect the IHD. After considering the structure and the reaction, the product will have a certain number of double bonds and rings that contribute to the IHD. Based on the analysis, the IHD of the product is determined to be 1.
