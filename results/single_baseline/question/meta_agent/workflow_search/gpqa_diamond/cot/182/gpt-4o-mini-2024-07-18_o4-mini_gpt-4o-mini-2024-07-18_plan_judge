Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The substrate is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: a cyclohexene ring (one DU for the ring, one for the ring C=C), a vinyl substituent (one more DU), an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid. Red P/HI reduces both the –CHO and –COOH to –CH2 and –CH3, respectively, without touching the C=C bonds. The product therefore retains the ring (1 DU) plus two C=C bonds (two more DUs), for a total IHD = 3.
