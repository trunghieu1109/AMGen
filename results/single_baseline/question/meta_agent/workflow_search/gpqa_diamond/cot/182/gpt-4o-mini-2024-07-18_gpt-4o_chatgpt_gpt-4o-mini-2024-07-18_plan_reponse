        "response": "The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The given compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond), a formyl group (1 double bond), a vinyl group (1 double bond), and a carboxylic acid group (1 double bond). This gives an initial IHD of 5. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the double bonds and functional groups are reduced, resulting in a saturated cyclohexane ring with no double bonds or additional rings, leading to an IHD of 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
