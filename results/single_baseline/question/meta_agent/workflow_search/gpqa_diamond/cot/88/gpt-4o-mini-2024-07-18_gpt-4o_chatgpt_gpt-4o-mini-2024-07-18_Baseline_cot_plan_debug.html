    <pre>1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, likely leading to the formation of a ketone due to elimination and rearrangement, as suggested by the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. The NMR signals suggest a structure with a ketone group. The reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is likely a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, converting the ketone to an alcohol. Ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide treatment typically cleaves double bonds, but here it might affect the alcohol, leading to an aldehyde or ketone. The most deshielded hydrogen in the final product is likely on a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, possibly an aldehyde hydrogen, which typically appears as a doublet due to coupling with adjacent hydrogens. However, the options suggest a more complex pattern, likely due to additional coupling. A doublet of triplets is a common pattern for such hydrogens in complex environments.
