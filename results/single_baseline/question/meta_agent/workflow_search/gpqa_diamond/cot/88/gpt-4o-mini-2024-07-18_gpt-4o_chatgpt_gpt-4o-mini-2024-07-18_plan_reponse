            "1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?",

        "response": "1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, likely leading to the formation of a ketone due to elimination and rearrangement, as suggested by the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. The NMR signals suggest a structure with a ketone group. The reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is likely a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, converting the ketone to an alcohol. Ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide treatment typically cleaves double bonds, but here it might affect the alcohol, leading to an aldehyde or ketone. The most deshielded hydrogen in the final product is likely on a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, possibly an aldehyde hydrogen, which typically appears as a doublet due to coupling with adjacent hydrogens. However, the options suggest a more complex pattern, likely due to additional coupling. A doublet of triplets is a common pattern for such hydrogens in complex environments.\n\nAnswer:A)",
