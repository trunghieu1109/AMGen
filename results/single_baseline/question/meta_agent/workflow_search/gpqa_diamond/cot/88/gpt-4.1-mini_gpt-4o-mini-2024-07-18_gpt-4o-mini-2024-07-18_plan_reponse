        "response": "To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, we need to analyze the structure of product 3 based on the reactions described. The initial product from the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely leads to a compound with multiple hydrogen environments. The subsequent reactions with aluminum isopropoxide and ozonolysis will further modify the structure. The most deshielded hydrogen atom will typically be one that is adjacent to multiple other hydrogen atoms or functional groups, leading to complex splitting patterns. Given the choices, a 'doublet of triplets' suggests that the hydrogen is coupled to two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, which is a plausible scenario in complex organic molecules. Therefore, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a doublet of triplets.\n\nAnswer:A",
