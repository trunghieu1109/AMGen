Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 3nAw', content='The most deshielded hydrogen in the ozonolysis product 3 will be the aldehydic proton. It is coupled to one neighboring CH (giving a doublet) and to two equivalent methylene protons (giving a triplet), resulting overall in a doublet of triplets.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
