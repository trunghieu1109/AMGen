            "An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to traveling at a speed close to the speed of light. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is different from the time experienced by an observer at rest relative to the Earth (coordinate time). The time dilation formula is given by: t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t' is the time experienced by the astronaut, t is the time experienced by an observer at rest, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. We are given that the velocity v = 0.99999987 * c. We need to find the time t such that the proper time t' experienced by the astronaut is 22 years. Solving for t, we have: t = t' * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Plugging in the values, we find that t is approximately 77 years.\n\nAnswer:C)",
