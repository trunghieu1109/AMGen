            "An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. At speed v = 0.99999987c, the travel time in Earth\u2019s frame is t = d/v \u2248 160,000 years. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1\u2013\u03b2\u00b2) with \u03b2 = 0.99999987 gives 1\u2013\u03b2 \u2248 1.3\u00d710\u207b\u2077, so 1\u2013\u03b2\u00b2 \u2248 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2077, hence \u03b3 \u2248 1/\u221a(2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2077) \u2248 1960. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is t\u2032 = t/\u03b3 \u2248 160,000 / 1960 \u2248 81.6 years. Thus from the astronaut\u2019s perspective the trip takes about 81 years.\n\nAnswer:D)",
