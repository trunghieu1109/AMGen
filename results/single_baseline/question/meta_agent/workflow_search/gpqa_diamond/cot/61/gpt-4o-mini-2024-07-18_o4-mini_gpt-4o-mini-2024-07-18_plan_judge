proposed answer: We need to build an α-hydroxy aldehyde linking two cyclohexyl fragments from ethynylcyclohexane. The literature route is: 1) deprotonation and alkylation (NaNH2/MeCl) to give internal alkyne, 2) partial hydrogenation over Pd–CaCO3 (Lindlar) to the cis‐alkene, 3) reductive ozonolysis (O3/(CH3)2S) to cleave the C=C into the two carbonyl fragments, and 4) base‐promoted crossed aldol (Ba(OH)2) to join them as the α-hydroxy aldehyde. This matches choice 1.
