Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to consider the necessary steps to introduce the functional groups and achieve the desired structure. The correct sequence of reagents should involve deprotonation, alkylation, reduction, ozonolysis, and possibly hydrolysis or oxidation steps. Analyzing the provided choices, I will determine which sequence aligns best with the required transformations.
