Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.\n\n1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?', choice1='(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one', choice2='((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', choice3='(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', choice4='((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Cyclohexanone enolized by LDA (kinetic enolate) adds to benzaldehyde via a Zimmerman–Traxler transition state to give the β-hydroxy ketone (product 1) with a new stereocenter at the benzylic position. Treatment with excess DAST converts the ketone into a geminal difluoride on the ring and replaces the benzylic OH with F via SN2 inversion. Thus product 2 is the benzyl fluoride bearing a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl substituent, with inversion at the benzylic center, corresponding to choice 4.
