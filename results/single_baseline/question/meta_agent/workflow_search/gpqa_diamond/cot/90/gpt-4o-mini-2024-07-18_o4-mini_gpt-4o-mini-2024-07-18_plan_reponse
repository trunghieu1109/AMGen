        "response": "Cyclohexanone enolized by LDA (kinetic enolate) adds to benzaldehyde via a Zimmerman\u2013Traxler transition state to give the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone (product 1) with a new stereocenter at the benzylic position. Treatment with excess DAST converts the ketone into a geminal difluoride on the ring and replaces the benzylic OH with F via SN2 inversion. Thus product 2 is the benzyl fluoride bearing a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl substituent, with inversion at the benzylic center, corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
