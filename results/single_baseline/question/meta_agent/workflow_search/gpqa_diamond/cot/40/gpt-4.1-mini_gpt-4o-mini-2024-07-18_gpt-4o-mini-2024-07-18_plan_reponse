        "response": "To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in vacuum is c = 1, and the speed of light in glass is c/n, where n is the index of refraction. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. We need to apply the formula for the addition of velocities in special relativity, which gives us the effective speed of light as seen by the observer. After analyzing the choices, the correct formula that represents the speed of light in glass relative to the observer is (1+n*v)/(n-v).\n\nAnswer:A",
