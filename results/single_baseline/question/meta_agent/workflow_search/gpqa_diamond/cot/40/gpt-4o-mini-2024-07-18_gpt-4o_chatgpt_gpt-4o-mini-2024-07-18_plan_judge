Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the index of refraction. Since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by: u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2), where u is the speed of light in the medium relative to the medium, v is the speed of the medium relative to the observer, and u' is the speed of light relative to the observer. In this case, u = c/n and c = 1, so we have u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v). Simplifying this expression, we get u' = (1 + nv) / (n + v).
