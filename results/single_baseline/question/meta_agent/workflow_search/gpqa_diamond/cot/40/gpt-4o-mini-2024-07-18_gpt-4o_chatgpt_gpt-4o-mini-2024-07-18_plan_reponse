        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the index of refraction. Since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by: u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2), where u is the speed of light in the medium relative to the medium, v is the speed of the medium relative to the observer, and u' is the speed of light relative to the observer. In this case, u = c/n and c = 1, so we have u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v). Simplifying this expression, we get u' = (1 + nv) / (n + v).\n\nAnswer:C)",
