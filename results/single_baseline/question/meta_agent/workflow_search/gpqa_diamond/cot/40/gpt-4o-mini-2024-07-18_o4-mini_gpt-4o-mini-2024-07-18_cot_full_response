Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent yofl', content='In the glass rest frame the light speed is u′=c/n=1/n toward the observer. The glass moves at speed v toward the observer in the lab frame. Using relativistic velocity addition:\n\nu=(u′+v)/(1+u′v) = (1/n+v)/(1+v/n) = (1+n v)/(n+v).\n\nThis matches choice 3, i.e. C).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
