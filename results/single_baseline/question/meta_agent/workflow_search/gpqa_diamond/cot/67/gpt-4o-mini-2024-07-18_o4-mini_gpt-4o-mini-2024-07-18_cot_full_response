Question: {'question': 'There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', 'choice1': 'gamma*B/2', 'choice2': 'gamma*B', 'choice3': 'gamma*B/sqrt(2)', 'choice4': 'sqrt(2)*gamma*B'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OhTw', content='The Hamiltonian after switching the field to +Y is H = -μ·B = -γ S_y B. The spin precesses about the Y-axis at angular frequency ω = γB, causing <S_z> (and hence μ_z) to oscillate as cos(γ B t). Therefore the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
