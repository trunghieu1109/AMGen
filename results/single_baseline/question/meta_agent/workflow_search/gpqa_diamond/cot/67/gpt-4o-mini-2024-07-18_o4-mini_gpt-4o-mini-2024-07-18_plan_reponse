            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "The Hamiltonian after switching the field to +Y is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S_y B. The spin precesses about the Y-axis at angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3B, causing <S_z> (and hence \u03bc_z) to oscillate as cos(\u03b3 B t). Therefore the oscillation frequency is \u03b3B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
