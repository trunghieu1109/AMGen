            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "The problem involves a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor frequency, which is determined by the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) and the magnetic field strength (B). The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is gamma * B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
