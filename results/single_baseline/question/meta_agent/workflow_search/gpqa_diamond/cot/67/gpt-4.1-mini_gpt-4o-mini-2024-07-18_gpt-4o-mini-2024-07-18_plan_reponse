            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "When the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on in a different direction, the spin of the particle will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The frequency of precession (Larmor frequency) is given by the formula omega = gamma * B, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnetic field strength. In this case, since the magnetic field is now along the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment will be equal to the Larmor frequency for the new field direction. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma * B.\n\nAnswer:gamma*B",
