            "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?",

        "response": "Klinefelter\u2019s (XXY) has an extra X chromosome but its phenotypic impact is muted because one X is largely inactivated. This process involves chromatin remodeling and gene silencing mediated by histone methylation and other epigenetic marks post-zygotically. Down syndrome (trisomy 21) lacks such chromosome-wide inactivation, so all three copies are expressed causing more severe phenotypes.\n\nAnswer:C)",
