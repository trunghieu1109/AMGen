            "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?",

        "response": "Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (XXY), while Down's syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are less severe than those of Down's syndrome. One reason for this is the process of X-chromosome inactivation, where one of the X chromosomes in each cell is largely inactivated, reducing the impact of having an extra X chromosome. This is related to chromatin modifications, such as methylation, that silence one of the X chromosomes. Therefore, the molecular mechanism responsible for the less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome is related to chromatin methylation.\n\nAnswer:C)",
