    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. &#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. &#39;}

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To determine which statement about SARS-CoV-2 is incorrect, I need to analyze each choice for accuracy based on known molecular biology of the virus. Each statement discusses different aspects of SARS-CoV-2&#39;s molecular mechanisms, including ribosomal frameshifting, the role of nsp10/nsp14 in mismatch repair, the apoptotic pathway involving ORF3a, and the correlation of frameshifting rates with pseudoknot conformations. I will evaluate the scientific validity of each statement to identify the one that is not correct.
