    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. &#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. &#39;}

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need to identify the single incorrect statement among the four. Statements 1 and 3 accurately describe SARS-CoV-2 -1 ribosomal frameshifting and ORF3a-induced apoptosis pathways, respectively. Statement 2 correctly portrays the nsp10/nsp14 exonuclease proofreading complex. Statement 4, however, is wrong: SARS-CoV-2’s frameshift pseudoknot exhibits at least three conformations under tension (unlike SARS-CoV’s two), so the claimed linear correlation with two conformations is incorrect.
