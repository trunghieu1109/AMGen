Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we need to determine the moles of H+ and OH- ions that react. First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates: moles of H+ from HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. H2SO4 is a strong acid and provides 2 moles of H+ per mole of H2SO4: moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 mol. Total moles of H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and provides 2 moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2: moles of OH- = 0.5 M * 0.2 L * 2 = 0.2 mol. The reaction is H+ + OH- -> H2O, so the limiting reactant is OH- with 0.2 mol. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically -57.1 kJ/mol for strong acid-strong base reactions. Therefore, the enthalpy change = 0.2 mol * -57.1 kJ/mol = -11.42 kJ. Converting to kcal: -11.42 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) = -2.73 kcal, which is closest to -2.72 kcal.
