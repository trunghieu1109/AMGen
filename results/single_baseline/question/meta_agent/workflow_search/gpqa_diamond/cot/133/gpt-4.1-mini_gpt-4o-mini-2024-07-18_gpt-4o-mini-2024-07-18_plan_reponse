        "response": "To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we first need to determine the moles of each reactant. HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. We will find the total moles of H+ ions from HCl and H2SO4, and the total moles of OH- ions from Ba(OH)2. Then we will find the limiting reactant and calculate the enthalpy change based on the neutralization reaction. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is typically around -57.1 kJ/mol. We will convert the final result to kcal if necessary.\n\nAnswer:The enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed is -16.0 kJ.",
