Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We want a mixture X of two unsaturated C6 compounds (no conjugation) whose hydrogenation gives only cyclohexane. The mixture Y formed by Pt-catalyzed disproportionation is equimolar benzene + cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y also gives only cyclohexane (Z), H mass fraction 0.1428 → Z is cycloalkane C₆H₁₂. The likely X components are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). These decolorize Br₂, are nonconjugated, and Pt disproportionates them: 1,4-diene dehydrogenates to benzene + H₂, cyclohexene hydrogenates with that H₂ to cyclohexane. Sum of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18
