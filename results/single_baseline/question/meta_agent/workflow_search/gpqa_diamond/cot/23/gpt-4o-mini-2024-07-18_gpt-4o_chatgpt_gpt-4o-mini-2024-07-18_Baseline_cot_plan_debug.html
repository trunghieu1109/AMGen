    <pre>The problem involves an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes. Upon treatment with platinum, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the absence of alkenes. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y results in a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This suggests Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: (mass of hydrogen / total mass) = 14.28%. Solving for the molecular formula, we find that Z is C7H8 (toluene), which has a hydrogen mass fraction of approximately 14.28%. Toluene is a common solvent and does not react further with hydrogen. Since Z is a constituent of mixture Y, mixture Y must contain toluene. The disproportionation of alkenes typically involves the conversion of alkenes to alkanes and arenes. Therefore, mixture X likely contains alkenes that can be converted to toluene. The simplest alkenes that can disproportionate to form toluene are C3H6 (propylene) and C4H8 (butene), which together have a total of 14 hydrogen atoms. However, the problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Since mixture X is equimolar and the simplest alkenes that can form toluene are C3H6 and C4H8, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is 12 (6 from C3H6 and 6 from C4H8).
