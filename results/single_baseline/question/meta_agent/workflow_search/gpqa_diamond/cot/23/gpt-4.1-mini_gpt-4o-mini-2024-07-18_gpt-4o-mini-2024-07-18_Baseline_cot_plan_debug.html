    <pre>To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the information given. Mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating they likely contain double bonds or reactive sites. The hydrogenation of mixture X leads to a hydrocarbon Z with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This suggests that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. The total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X can be inferred from the properties of the compounds involved and the stoichiometry of the reactions. Given the choices provided, we need to find the most plausible total number of hydrogen atoms based on typical structures of organic compounds that fit the description. After considering the options, 22 hydrogen atoms seems to be a reasonable estimate for two liquids that could be alkenes or similar compounds that would yield a saturated hydrocarbon upon hydrogenation.
