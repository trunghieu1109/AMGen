Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The problem involves an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes. Upon treatment with platinum, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the absence of alkenes. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y results in a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This suggests Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: (mass of hydrogen / total mass) = 14.28%. Solving for the molecular formula, we find that Z is C7H8 (toluene), which has a hydrogen mass fraction of approximately 14.28%. Toluene is a common solvent and does not react further with hydrogen. Since Z is a constituent of mixture Y, mixture Y must contain toluene. The disproportionation of alkenes typically involves the conversion of alkenes to alkanes and arenes. Therefore, mixture X likely contains alkenes that can be converted to toluene. The simplest alkenes that can disproportionate to form toluene are C3H6 (propylene) and C4H8 (butene), which together have a total of 14 hydrogen atoms. However, the problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Since mixture X is equimolar and the simplest alkenes that can form toluene are C3H6 and C4H8, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is 12 (6 from C3H6 and 6 from C4H8).
