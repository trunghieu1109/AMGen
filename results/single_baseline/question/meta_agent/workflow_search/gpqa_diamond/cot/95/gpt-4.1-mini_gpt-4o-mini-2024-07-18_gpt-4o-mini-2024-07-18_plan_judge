Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the order of magnitude of the entropy of a black hole, we can use the formula for the entropy S of a black hole, which is given by S = (k * A) / (4 * l_p^2), where A is the area of the event horizon and l_p is the Planck length. The area A of the event horizon can be related to the angular size and distance. The angular size θ in radians can be converted from degrees, and we can use the formula for the area of a sphere to find the area of the event horizon. After calculating the area, we can then find the entropy and determine its order of magnitude. Given the choices, we will compare our calculated value to the provided options.
