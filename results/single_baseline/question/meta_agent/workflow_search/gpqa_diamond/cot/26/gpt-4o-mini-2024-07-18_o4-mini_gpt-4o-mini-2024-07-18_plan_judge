Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle is the signal recognition particle (SRP) which binds the emerging signal sequence on a nascent chain at the ribosome in the cytosol, pausing translation and directing it to the rough ER for glycosylation. The chain will enter the secretory pathway and be secreted to the extracellular space.
