Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: For reaction A, we have a Michael addition where the enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one attacks ethyl acrylate. The major product will be determined by the stability of the enolate and the steric hindrance. The enolate will form at the less hindered position, which is the 4-position relative to the ketone, leading to the product ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. For reaction B, we have a conjugate addition of 1-nitropropane to (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH. The nitronate anion will add to the less hindered end of the alkene, leading to 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 3.
