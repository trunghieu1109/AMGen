        "response": "Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has no alpha\u2010hydrogens at C2 (quaternary) so enolate forms exclusively at C6. The enolate undergoes a Michael addition to ethyl acrylate, giving ethyl 3-(cyclohexyl)propanoate with the chain attached at original C6. When naming the cyclohexyl substituent, the ketone (original C1) is four carbons away from the attachment point, so it is a 4-oxocyclohexyl. The substituents (ethyl and methyl) end up at positions 3 and 5 of that cyclohexyl ring. Thus A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\nReaction B: 1-nitropropane is deprotonated at C2, giving a nitronate that does a Michael addition to (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The addition takes place at the \u03b2-carbon of the nitrile, yielding, after workup, a linear hexanenitrile chain with a methyl substituent at C3 (from the alkene) and the nitropropyl unit at C4. Thus B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\nComparing to the choices gives choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
