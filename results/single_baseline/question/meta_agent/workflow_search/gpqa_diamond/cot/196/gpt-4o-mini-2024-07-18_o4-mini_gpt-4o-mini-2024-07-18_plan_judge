Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR shows a broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR has a 10.5 ppm broad singlet (CO2H), two aromatic doublets (2H each) showing a para-disubstituted benzene, and aliphatic signals (2.9 m, 1H; 1.7 m, 2H; 1.4 d, 3H; 0.9 t, 3H) consistent with a sec-butyl group. Thus X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (choice 2). Red phosphorus and HI reduce the COOH to CH3, yielding the corresponding toluene derivative: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice 1, A).
