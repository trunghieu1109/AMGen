Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To identify the final product of Compound X after reacting with red phosphorus and HI, we need to analyze the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak around 3400–2500 cm-1, indicating the presence of an acidic functional group, likely a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. The NMR data shows signals that correspond to aromatic protons and aliphatic protons, indicating a complex structure. The presence of a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid proton. The other peaks indicate a substituted aromatic ring and aliphatic chains. Given the choices, the presence of a carboxylic acid and the structure of the aromatic ring suggests that the final product is likely to be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, as it matches the expected structure after the reaction with HI, which typically leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid from an aromatic compound. Therefore, the answer is choice 2.
