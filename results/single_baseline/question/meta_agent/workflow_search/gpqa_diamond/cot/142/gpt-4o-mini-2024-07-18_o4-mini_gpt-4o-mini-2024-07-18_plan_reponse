            "The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement is a chemical reaction involving the conversion of a pinacol molecule, containing two adjacent alcohol groups, into a pinacolone under acidic conditions. It proceeds through the protonation of one alcohol group, followed by a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a ketone (pinacolone) and the rearrangement of the molecule's structure.\nWhat are the starting materials and products of the following Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reactions?\nA + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\nmethyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The first substrate must be a cyclohexane diol to give the 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, so A is the cyclohexane diol. For the second, protonation and loss at the tertiary center leads to a hydride shift, giving the ketone at C3. Thus B is the methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D",
