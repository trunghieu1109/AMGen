Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 3r65', content='The Lyα line at 1216 Å is only observable from the ground once redshifted into the atmospheric optical window, typically above ∼3500 Å. Setting 1216×(1+z)=3500 gives (1+z)=3500/1216≈2.88, so z≈1.88. The closest choice is z≈1.9.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
