        "response": "To detect the Lyman alpha emission at ~1216 Angstroms from neutral hydrogen clouds, we need to consider the redshift (z) that would shift this wavelength into the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. The Lyman alpha line is redshifted according to the formula: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). For ground-based optical telescopes, we typically consider wavelengths in the range of ~4000 to ~7000 Angstroms. We need to find the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha line is shifted into this range. Calculating the redshift for the lower limit, we can set the observed wavelength to 4000 Angstroms and solve for z: 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving this gives us z = (4000/1216) - 1, which is approximately 2.29. Therefore, the closest lower limit from the choices provided is 2.4.\n\nAnswer:B",
