Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Lyα line at 1216 Å is only observable from the ground once redshifted into the atmospheric optical window, typically above ∼3500 Å. Setting 1216×(1+z)=3500 gives (1+z)=3500/1216≈2.88, so z≈1.88. The closest choice is z≈1.9.
