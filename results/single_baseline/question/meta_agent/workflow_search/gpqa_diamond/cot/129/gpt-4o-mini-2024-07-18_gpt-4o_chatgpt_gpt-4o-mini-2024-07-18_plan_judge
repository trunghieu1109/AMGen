Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?

proposed answer: To detect the Lyman alpha absorption from neutral hydrogen clouds using optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range that these telescopes can observe. Optical telescopes typically observe light in the range of about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. The Lyman alpha line is originally at 1216 Angstroms. To be observed in the optical range, the light must be redshifted into this range. The redshift z is given by the formula: observed wavelength = (1 + z) * original wavelength. To find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the lower limit of the optical range, which is 4000 Angstroms. Solving for z: 4000 = (1 + z) * 1216, we get z = (4000/1216) - 1 â‰ˆ 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29, which is closest to choice 2.4.
