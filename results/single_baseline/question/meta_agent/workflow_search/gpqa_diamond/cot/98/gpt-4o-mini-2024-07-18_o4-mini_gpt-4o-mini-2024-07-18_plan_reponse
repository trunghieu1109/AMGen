            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH",

        "response": "We have a carboxylic acid (broad 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, strong 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9). The \u00b9H NMR shows two key multiplets: a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). A dtq arises when a proton couples to one proton (doublet), two equivalent protons (triplet), and three equivalent protons (quartet). A dtt arises when it couples to one proton (doublet) and two different sets of two equivalent protons (two triplets). Checking each structure: 2,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and the 3-methylpentanoic acid give dtq but not dtt; the 4-carbon-chain ethyl derivative gives a dtt and a dt but no quartet in the dt. Only CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (choice 3) has one CH coupling to CH3 (3H), CH2 (2H) and CH (1H) (dtq) and the adjacent CH coupling to CH2 (2H), CH2 (2H) and CH (1H) (dtt).\n\nAnswer:C)",
