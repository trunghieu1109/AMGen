Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers in the FTIR spectrum suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely indicating a carboxylic acid due to the strong peak at 1700 wavenumbers, which is characteristic of C=O stretching in carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns, which suggest multiple neighboring protons. The absence of vinyl-hydrogens indicates that there are no double bonds in the compound. Analyzing the given choices, the presence of a carboxylic acid and the splitting patterns can help identify the correct structure. The compound with the most likely structure that fits these characteristics is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, as it has the necessary branching and functional groups.
