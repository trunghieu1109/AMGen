Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers, which is indicative of an O-H stretch, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid. The strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers indicates a C=O stretch, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows no vinyl hydrogens, so the compound does not contain any C=C double bonds. The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets suggests complex splitting patterns, likely due to multiple neighboring hydrogens. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH fits these observations as it contains a carboxylic acid group and has a complex splitting pattern due to the presence of multiple methyl and methine groups.
