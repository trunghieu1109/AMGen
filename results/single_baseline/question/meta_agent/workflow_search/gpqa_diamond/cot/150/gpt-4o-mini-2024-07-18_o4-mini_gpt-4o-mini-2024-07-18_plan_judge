Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, find the eigenvalues of P. It is the adjacency‐type matrix for a 3‐vertex path with coupling a=1/√2, whose eigenvalues are +1, 0, −1. To get the probability of measuring 0, project the (normalized) state |ψ>=(-1,2,1) onto the normalized zero‐eigenvector |φ0>∝(1,0,−1).  

Normalize |ψ>: ||ψ||^2=1+4+1=6 ⇒ |ψ_norm>=(1/√6)(−1,2,1).  
Normalize |φ0>: ||(1,0,−1)||^2=2⇒|φ0>=(1/√2)(1,0,−1).  
Compute amplitude: ⟨φ0|ψ_norm⟩=(1/√2·1/√6)(−1−1)=−2/√12=−1/√3 ⇒ probability=|−1/√3|^2=1/3.
