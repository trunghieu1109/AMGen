Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fZu7', content="To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to evaluate each option. Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors if data from different sources are not properly integrated. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion refers to inconsistencies in chromosome naming conventions, which can cause issues in data alignment and analysis. Reference assembly mismatch occurs when different reference genomes are used, leading to discrepancies in data interpretation. Incorrect ID conversion can result in misidentification of genes or variants. All these issues are known to cause problems in genomics data analysis. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is that all of these issues are common sources of errors.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
