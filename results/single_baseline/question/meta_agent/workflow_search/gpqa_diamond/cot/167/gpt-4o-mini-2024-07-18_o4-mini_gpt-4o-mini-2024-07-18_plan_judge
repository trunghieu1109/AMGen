Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question lists four issues and asks which are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. 
1. Mutually incompatible data formats typically lead to parse errors or obvious mismatches rather than subtle errors.  
2. The “chr”/“no chr” confusion can silently shift or drop data when matching chromosome labels.  
3. Reference assembly mismatches (e.g., hg19 vs hg38) cause coordinates to be off in ways that are hard to detect without careful validation.  
4. Incorrect ID conversion (e.g., gene symbols vs Ensembl IDs) can map to the wrong genes without obvious flags.  
Thus, items 2, 3, and 4 are the key subtle error sources.
