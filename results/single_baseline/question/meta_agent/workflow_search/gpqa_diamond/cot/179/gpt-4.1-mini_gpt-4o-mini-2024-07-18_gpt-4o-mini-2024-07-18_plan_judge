Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy between the charges. The potential energy U between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, we have 12 charges of 2e each at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P. The total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges. Since all charges are identical, we can calculate the energy for one pair and then multiply by 12. The charge of an electron is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C, so 2e = 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C = 3.204 x 10^-19 C. Therefore, the potential energy for one pair is U = (8.99 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19) * (3.204 x 10^-19) / 2. The total energy for 12 pairs will be 12 times this value. After calculating, we will compare the result with the provided choices to find the correct answer.
