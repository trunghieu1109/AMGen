Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have 13 charges q=2e, one fixed at P, 12 on a sphere of radius R=2 m. The total electrostatic energy is U=∑_{i<j} k q_i q_j/r_{ij}. Split into center–sphere and sphere–sphere contributions:

1) Center–sphere: 12 pairs each at separation 2 m gives U1=12·k q^2/2=6 k q^2.

2) Sphere–sphere: The 12 charges on a sphere arrange at the vertices of a regular icosahedron. For a unit sphere the minimal Thomson energy E12=∑_{i<j}1/r_{ij}≈49.161. Thus U2=k q^2/R·E12.

Hence total U=k q^2/R·(6+E12). Using e=1.602×10^-19 C, q=2e, k=1/(4πε0)≈8.9875×10^9 N·m^2/C^2, R=2 m yields U≈2.54×10^-26 J, which is closest to choice A) 2.822×10^-26 J.
