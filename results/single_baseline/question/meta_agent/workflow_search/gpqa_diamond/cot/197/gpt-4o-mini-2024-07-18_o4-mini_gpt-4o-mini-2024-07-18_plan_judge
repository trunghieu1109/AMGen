Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have Co2+ and SCN- at c(Co)=10^-2 M, [SCN-]≈0.1 M so bound SCN- is small relative to 0.1 M allowing [L]≈0.1 M. Fraction of Co as Co(SCN)2 = β2[L]^2 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4). Compute terms: β1L=9·0.1=0.9, β2L2=40·0.01=0.4, β3L3=63·0.001=0.063, β4L4=16·0.0001=0.0016. Denominator=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646. Fraction=0.4/2.3646≈0.1692≈16.9%.
