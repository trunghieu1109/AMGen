Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the net potential energy of the system with a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, we need to consider the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere will have an induced charge that affects the potential energy. The correct formula for the potential energy in this configuration is derived from the interaction between the charge and the induced charge on the sphere. After analyzing the choices, the correct expression for the potential energy is found to be U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2).
