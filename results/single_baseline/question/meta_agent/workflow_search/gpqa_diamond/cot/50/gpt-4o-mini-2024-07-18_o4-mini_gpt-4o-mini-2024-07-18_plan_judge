Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We use the method of images: A real charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R can be modeled by placing an image charge q'=-qR/d at distance d'=R^2/d inside the sphere. The interaction energy between q and q' is U_int = kqq'/(d - d'), but since the sphere is grounded and induced charges do no self-interaction, the net potential energy is U = Â½ U_int. Substituting q' and d' gives U = -(1/2)kq^2R/(d^2 - R^2).
