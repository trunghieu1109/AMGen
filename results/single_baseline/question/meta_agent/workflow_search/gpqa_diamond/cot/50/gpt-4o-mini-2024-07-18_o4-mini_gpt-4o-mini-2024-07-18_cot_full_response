Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent XuCu', content="We use the method of images: A real charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R can be modeled by placing an image charge q'=-qR/d at distance d'=R^2/d inside the sphere. The interaction energy between q and q' is U_int = kqq'/(d - d'), but since the sphere is grounded and induced charges do no self-interaction, the net potential energy is U = Â½ U_int. Substituting q' and d' gives U = -(1/2)kq^2R/(d^2 - R^2).\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
