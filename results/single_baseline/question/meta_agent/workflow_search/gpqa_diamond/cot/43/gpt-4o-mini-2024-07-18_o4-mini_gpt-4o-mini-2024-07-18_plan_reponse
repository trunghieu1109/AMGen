            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",
            "Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells",
            "Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ",

        "response": "We need to identify which experiment will NOT help reveal the mitochondrial role of the anti-diabetes drug. \n\nOption 1: Expressing luciferase in cells and measuring luminescence after adding luciferin reports intracellular ATP levels, which reflects mitochondrial ATP production\u2014so it is informative. \nOption 2: Mito-RTP is a mitochondria\u2010targeted fluorescent probe, and confocal imaging reveals mitochondrial localization, mass, or morphology\u2014informative. \nOption 3: Isolating mitochondria by differential centrifugation then using a Glucose Uptake assay kit is inappropriate, because glucose uptake occurs at the plasma membrane, not in mitochondria\u2014so it does NOT inform on mitochondrial function. \nOption 4: JC-1 (tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) measured by flow cytometry directly assesses mitochondrial membrane potential\u2014informative.\n\nTherefore, Choice 3 will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug.\n\nAnswer:C)",
