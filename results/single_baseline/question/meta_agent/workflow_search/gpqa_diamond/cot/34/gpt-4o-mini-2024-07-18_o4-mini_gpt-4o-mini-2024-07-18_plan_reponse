            "Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2\u00d72 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(\u03c6) = a(\u03c6). Here, a is the eigenvalue, \u03c6 is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c\u2219S; where the constant c=h/4\u03c0 and S being a 2\u00d72 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? ",

            "The eigenfunctions \u03c6 of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.",
            "The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or \u20131/2, and the real part of that are +1 or \u20131. ",
