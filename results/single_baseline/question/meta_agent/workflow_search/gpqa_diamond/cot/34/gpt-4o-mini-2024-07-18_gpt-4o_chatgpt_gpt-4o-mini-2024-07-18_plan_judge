proposed answer: The matrix S given is a Pauli matrix, specifically the y-component of the Pauli matrices, which is used to represent spin operators for spin-1/2 particles. The matrix S is given as S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli matrix σ_y. The eigenvalues of σ_y are known to be ±1, and the eigenvectors are the corresponding eigenfunctions. The operator Ay = c * S, where c = h/4π, means the eigenvalues of Ay will be c times the eigenvalues of S, which are ±c. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/4π. The eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as those of S, which are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.
