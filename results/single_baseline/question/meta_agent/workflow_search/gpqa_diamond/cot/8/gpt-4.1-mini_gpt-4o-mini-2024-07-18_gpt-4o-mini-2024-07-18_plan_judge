Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the given options. C3h symmetry indicates a molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Among the options, quinuclidine is known to have a symmetrical structure that fits this description. The other molecules are more complex and do not exhibit C3h symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is quinuclidine.
