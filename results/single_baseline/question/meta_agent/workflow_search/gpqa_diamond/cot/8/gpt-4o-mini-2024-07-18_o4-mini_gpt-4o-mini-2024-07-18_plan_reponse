        "response": "We need a molecule with a C3 principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane (C3h) but no vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine is not trigonal; triisopropyl borate is nonplanar and lacks \u03c3h; the large fused cyclic polyoxo compounds are planar. The benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c\u2032:5,6-c\u2033]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone derivative is planar, has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, and only the horizontal mirror plane, giving C3h symmetry, whereas the triphenyleno analogue retains additional vertical planes (D3h).\n\nAnswer:C)",
