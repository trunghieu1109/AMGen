Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6XrI', content='We need a molecule with a C3 principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane (C3h) but no vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine is not trigonal; triisopropyl borate is nonplanar and lacks σh; the large fused cyclic polyoxo compounds are planar. The benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c′:5,6-c″]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone derivative is planar, has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, and only the horizontal mirror plane, giving C3h symmetry, whereas the triphenyleno analogue retains additional vertical planes (D3h).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
