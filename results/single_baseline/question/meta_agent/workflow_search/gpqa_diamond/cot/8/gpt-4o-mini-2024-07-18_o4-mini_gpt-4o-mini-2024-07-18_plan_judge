Question: Example(question="which of the following molecules has c3h symmetry?\ntriisopropyl borate\nquinuclidine\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", choice1='quinuclidine', choice2='triisopropyl borate\n', choice3="benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone", choice4="triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need a molecule with a C3 principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane (C3h) but no vertical mirror planes. Quinuclidine is not trigonal; triisopropyl borate is nonplanar and lacks σh; the large fused cyclic polyoxo compounds are planar. The benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c′:5,6-c″]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone derivative is planar, has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, and only the horizontal mirror plane, giving C3h symmetry, whereas the triphenyleno analogue retains additional vertical planes (D3h).
