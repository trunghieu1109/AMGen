Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent HYvY', content='Epoxidation of a symmetric internal alkene (oct-4-ene) by mCPBA is stereospecific (syn). For the E isomer, the two substituents are trans so syn addition gives a trans‐epoxide, which is chiral and formed as a racemic (R,R)+(S,S) pair (2 enantiomers). For the Z isomer, the substituents are cis so syn addition gives a cis‐epoxide, which is meso (achiral, single compound). Combining both reactions gives three distinct compounds: the enantiomeric pair (coelute on an achiral column) and the meso. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column the enantiomers appear as one peak and the meso as a second peak (2 peaks total). On a chiral HPLC column the enantiomers are resolved into two peaks plus the meso as a separate peak (3 peaks total).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
