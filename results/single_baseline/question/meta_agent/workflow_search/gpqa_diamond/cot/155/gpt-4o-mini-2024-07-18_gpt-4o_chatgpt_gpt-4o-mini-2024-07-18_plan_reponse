            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 both involve the epoxidation of an alkene followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene. The epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA is stereospecific, so the (E)-alkene will give a different epoxide than the (Z)-alkene. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, each epoxide will give a diol. The (E)-epoxide will give a meso diol, while the (Z)-epoxide will give a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 1 gives one meso compound, and Reaction 2 gives two enantiomers. In total, there are three different diols: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers. On a standard HPLC, the meso compound and the racemic mixture of enantiomers will show up as two peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the meso compound will be one peak, and the two enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks, resulting in three peaks.\n\nAnswer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC",
