Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Epoxidation of a symmetric internal alkene (oct-4-ene) by mCPBA is stereospecific (syn). For the E isomer, the two substituents are trans so syn addition gives a trans‐epoxide, which is chiral and formed as a racemic (R,R)+(S,S) pair (2 enantiomers). For the Z isomer, the substituents are cis so syn addition gives a cis‐epoxide, which is meso (achiral, single compound). Combining both reactions gives three distinct compounds: the enantiomeric pair (coelute on an achiral column) and the meso. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column the enantiomers appear as one peak and the meso as a second peak (2 peaks total). On a chiral HPLC column the enantiomers are resolved into two peaks plus the meso as a separate peak (3 peaks total).
