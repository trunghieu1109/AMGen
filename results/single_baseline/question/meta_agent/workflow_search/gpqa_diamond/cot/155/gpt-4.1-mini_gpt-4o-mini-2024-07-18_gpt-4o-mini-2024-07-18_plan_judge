Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid hydrolysis, leading to the formation of a diol with specific stereochemistry. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes the same process, resulting in a different diol with a different stereochemistry. Since both reactions yield diols, and the (E) and (Z) forms lead to different products, we expect to see different peaks in the chromatograms. The standard HPLC will not resolve the stereochemistry, while the chiral HPLC will. Therefore, we will have 2 distinct diols from each reaction, leading to 4 peaks in total in the chiral HPLC, but only 2 peaks in the standard HPLC. Thus, the correct observation is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
