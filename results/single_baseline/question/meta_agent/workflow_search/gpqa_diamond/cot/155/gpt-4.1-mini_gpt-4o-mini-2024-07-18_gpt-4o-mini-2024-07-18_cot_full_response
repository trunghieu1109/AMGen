Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Tb2l', content='In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid hydrolysis, leading to the formation of a diol with specific stereochemistry. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes the same process, resulting in a different diol with a different stereochemistry. Since both reactions yield diols, and the (E) and (Z) forms lead to different products, we expect to see different peaks in the chromatograms. The standard HPLC will not resolve the stereochemistry, while the chiral HPLC will. Therefore, we will have 2 distinct diols from each reaction, leading to 4 peaks in total in the chiral HPLC, but only 2 peaks in the standard HPLC. Thus, the correct observation is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
