        "response": "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we need to consider the bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. We will first determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule, then use the bond energies to calculate the total energy required to break these bonds, and finally relate this to the enthalpy of formation. The molecule has multiple carbon and hydrogen atoms, and we will account for the bonds accordingly.\n\nAnswer:11200 kJ/mol",
