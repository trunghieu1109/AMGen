    <pre>To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound, we need to consider the bonds broken and formed. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. First, count the number of each type of bond in the compound. There are 8 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, and 18 C-H bonds. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the enthalpy of atomization of carbon and the bond energies. The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the sum of the energies released when the bonds in the products are formed. The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol, which is the energy required to form gaseous carbon atoms from solid carbon. The bond energies are given as: H-H = 100 kJ/mol, C-C = 200 kJ/mol, C=C = 300 kJ/mol, C-H = 400 kJ/mol. Calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants and the total energy released when the bonds in the product are formed. The difference will give the enthalpy of formation.
