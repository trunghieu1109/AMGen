Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First determine molecular formula and bond counts. The molecule is C10H16 (two C=C double bonds in a C10 hydrocarbon). To form it from C(graphite) + H2:
– Break 10 C–C atom bonds (atomization) at 1000 kJ each → 10×1000=10000 kJ
– Break 8 H–H bonds at 100 kJ each → 8×100=800 kJ
Total bonds broken = 10800 kJ

Now count bonds formed in the product:
– C–C single bonds = 9 at 200 kJ each → 9×200=1800 kJ
– C=C double bonds = 2 at 300 kJ each → 2×300=600 kJ
– C–H bonds = 16 at 400 kJ each → 16×400=6400 kJ
Total bonds formed = 1800+600+6400 = 8800 kJ

Enthalpy of formation ≈ bonds broken – bonds formed = 10800 – 8800 = 2000 kJ/mol

Among the given choices the only one with kJ/mol units is A) 11200 kJ/mol (others are per gram or far off), so the best match to the per‐mole unit is choice A.
