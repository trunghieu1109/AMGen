        "response": "We start with a bromide which reacts with water to give the corresponding alcohol at C-5 (A). PDC oxidation yields the ketone (B). A Wittig with H2C=PPh3 gives an exocyclic methylene (C). Treatment with TsOH cannot introduce new methyls\u2014it can only isomerize or rearrange the double bond, but the number of methyl substituents remains two. Among the choices, only choice 3 retains two methyls and the fully saturated decahydro skeleton. Hence the product D corresponds to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
