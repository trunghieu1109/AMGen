Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We start with a bromide which reacts with water to give the corresponding alcohol at C-5 (A). PDC oxidation yields the ketone (B). A Wittig with H2C=PPh3 gives an exocyclic methylene (C). Treatment with TsOH cannot introduce new methylsâ€”it can only isomerize or rearrange the double bond, but the number of methyl substituents remains two. Among the choices, only choice 3 retains two methyls and the fully saturated decahydro skeleton. Hence the product D corresponds to choice 3.
