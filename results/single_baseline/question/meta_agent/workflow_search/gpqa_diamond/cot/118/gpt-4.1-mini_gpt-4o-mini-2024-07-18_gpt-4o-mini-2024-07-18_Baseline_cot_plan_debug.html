    <pre>To identify product D, we need to analyze the series of reactions step by step. Starting with the initial compound, we can deduce the transformations that occur at each step. The first reaction with water likely introduces a hydroxyl group, leading to compound A. The subsequent reaction with PDC (pyridinium dichromate) typically oxidizes alcohols, which would modify compound A to compound B. The next step involves a reaction with H2CPPh3, which suggests a phosphine-mediated transformation, likely leading to compound C. Finally, the treatment with TsOH (tosylate) would typically lead to a rearrangement or dehydration, resulting in product D. By analyzing the choices, we can match the structure of product D with the correct option based on the transformations described.
