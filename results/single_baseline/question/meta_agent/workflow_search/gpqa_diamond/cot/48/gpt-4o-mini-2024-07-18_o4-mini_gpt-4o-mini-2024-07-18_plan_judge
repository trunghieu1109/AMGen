Question: Example(question='Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.\n1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A\n(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C', choice1='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice2='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', choice3='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice4='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Step 1: For reaction A, acid and heat will cleave the acetal (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine) to an aldehyde and then undergo a Prins-type cyclization with the homoallylic alcohol (but-3-en-2-ol) to give a six-membered 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran bearing the amine at C-2 (6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine).
Step 2: For reaction B, thermal intramolecular [2+2] cyclization of the diyne yields a cyclobutane ring with two exocyclic double bonds (diethylidenecyclobutane), typically in a (1Z,2E) geometry.
Step 3: For reaction C, a Claisen rearrangement of the vinyl ether gives the corresponding γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl, namely 4-methylenehexanal.
Matching these to the choices, choice3 exactly fits A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal.
