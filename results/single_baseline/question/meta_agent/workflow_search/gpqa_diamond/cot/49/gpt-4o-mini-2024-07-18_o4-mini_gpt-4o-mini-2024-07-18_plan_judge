Question: Example(question='Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?', choice1='3', choice2='1', choice3='2', choice4='6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a factor of 1/(4π)^2. Here we see 1/(4π)^6 = [1/(4π)^2]^3, so the diagram has 3 loops.

Answer:A)
Extracted answer: A)
Correct answer: 1
