    <pre>To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we need to analyze the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a diagram is often related to the powers of the coupling constants and factors of 1/(4pi). The factor 1/(4pi)^6 suggests a loop order, as each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 in dimensional regularization. Therefore, 1/(4pi)^6 corresponds to 3 loops, since (4pi)^6 = (4pi^2)^3.
