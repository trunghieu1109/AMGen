Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we can use the conservation of momentum and energy principles. Since the photons have the same energy and are emitted in opposite directions, we can visualize the situation in a coordinate system. The upper-right photon can be considered to be at an angle θ from the horizontal axis, and the lower-right photon will be at an angle of -θ. The total angle between the two photons will then be 2θ. Given that the photons are emitted symmetrically, we can deduce that the angle between them is 180 degrees minus the angle of emission. The choices provided suggest that the angle between the two directions is likely to be one of the given options. The most reasonable angle that fits the scenario of two photons emitted at an angle that sums to 180 degrees is 138 degrees, as it represents a significant angle between the two directions of emission.
