    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy in the center of mass frame of the electron and positron system. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is related to the velocity \( v \) by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \). For the electron, \( \gamma = 4 \), which means its velocity \( v_e = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \). For the positron, \( \gamma = 2 \), which means its velocity \( v_p = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \). In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, and the total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. After annihilation, the two photons must have equal energy and opposite momentum to conserve both energy and momentum. The angle between the directions of the photons can be found by considering the geometry of the situation. Since the photons have equal energy and are moving in opposite directions in the center of mass frame, the angle between them is 180 degrees. However, in the lab frame, where the electron and positron are moving towards each other, the angle will be different due to relativistic effects. The problem states that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, indicating that the angle between them is less than 180 degrees. By considering the relativistic velocity addition and the fact that the photons have equal energy, we can determine the angle between them in the lab frame. The correct angle is 138 degrees.
