            "An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?",

Total momentum p_tot=(\u221a15\u2013\u221a3)m\u22482.141m; total energy E_tot=6m. After annihilation into two photons each has energy 3m and momentum 3m, moving symmetrically at \u00b1\u03c6 to the x-axis. Then 2\u00b7(3m\u00b7cos\u03c6)=p_tot\u21d2cos\u03c6=2.141/(6)=0.3568\u21d2\u03c6\u224869.0\u00b0. Angle between photons=2\u03c6\u2248138\u00b0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
