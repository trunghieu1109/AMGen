Question: {'question': 'An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', 'choice1': '96', 'choice2': '74', 'choice3': '138', 'choice4': '172'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent L9ai', content='Compute electron and positron momenta in lab frame: electron gamma=4 gives beta1=√15/4, p1=beta1·E1=(√15/4)·4m=m√15≈3.873m; positron gamma=2 gives beta2=–√3/2, p2=beta2·E2=(–√3/2)·2m=–m√3≈–1.732m. Total momentum p_tot=(√15–√3)m≈2.141m; total energy E_tot=6m. After annihilation into two photons each has energy 3m and momentum 3m, moving symmetrically at ±φ to the x-axis. Then 2·(3m·cosφ)=p_tot⇒cosφ=2.141/(6)=0.3568⇒φ≈69.0°. Angle between photons=2φ≈138°.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
