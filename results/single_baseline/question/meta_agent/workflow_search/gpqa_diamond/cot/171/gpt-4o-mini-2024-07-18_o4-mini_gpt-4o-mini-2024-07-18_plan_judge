Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have N_exc ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). Given N_exc,1/N_exc,2=2, so 2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)]. Taking ln: ln2=ΔE/k·(T1−T2)/(T1T2). Among the choices only D matches this form (omitting the ΔE/k factor common to both sides).
