    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;}

    <pre>The problem involves the relative population of energy levels in two stars, which can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: N_1/N_2 = exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the population of the energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have: N_1/N_2 = 2. Therefore, 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This can be rearranged to ln(2) = ΔE/k * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2).
