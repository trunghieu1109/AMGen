Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MkAy', content='In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is U = (1/2)kA^2. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy mc^2 and the kinetic energy T. At maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. The relativistic kinetic energy is T = (γ - 1)mc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. The total energy is conserved, so E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, E = γmc^2. Equating these gives γmc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. Solving for γ gives γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). We know γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v^2/c^2 gives v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2. Therefore, v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2).\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
