Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5vMV', content='We use energy conservation. At maximum amplitude x=A, speed is zero so total energy E = rest energy + potential = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2. At x=0, potential is zero so all extra energy is kinetic: γ m c^2 = E = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2. Thus γ = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). The speed satisfies β^2 = 1 - 1/γ^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2. Hence v_max = c sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2], which is choice B.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
