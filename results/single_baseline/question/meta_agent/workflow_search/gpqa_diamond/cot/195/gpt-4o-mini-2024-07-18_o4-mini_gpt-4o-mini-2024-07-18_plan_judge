Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We use energy conservation. At maximum amplitude x=A, speed is zero so total energy E = rest energy + potential = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2. At x=0, potential is zero so all extra energy is kinetic: γ m c^2 = E = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2. Thus γ = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). The speed satisfies β^2 = 1 - 1/γ^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2. Hence v_max = c sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2], which is choice B.
