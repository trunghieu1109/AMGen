Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent htbT', content='The flux drop at observed 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman-α break at 121.6 nm rest. So z ≃ (790/121.6)–1 ≃ 5.5. For ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7), the comoving distance to z~5.5 is about 8–9 Gpc, closer to 8 Gpc.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
