Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The phrase “compounds are on top of each other” likely refers to an analytical separation technique such as thin-layer chromatography, where different compounds are separated based on polarity. If two compounds have similar polarities, they travel the same distance on the TLC plate and their spots overlap, appearing “on top of each other.”
