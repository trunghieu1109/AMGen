Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating well, possibly due to similar properties. In a synthetic organic chemistry context, this could mean that the compounds are not separating during a purification process like chromatography. If the compounds have similar polarities, they would elute together in chromatography, making them difficult to separate. This aligns with the idea of them being 'on top of each other'.
