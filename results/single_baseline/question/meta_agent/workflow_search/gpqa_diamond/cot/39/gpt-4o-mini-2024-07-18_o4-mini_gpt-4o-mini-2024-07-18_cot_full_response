Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ynm6', content='The phrase “compounds are on top of each other” likely refers to an analytical separation technique such as thin-layer chromatography, where different compounds are separated based on polarity. If two compounds have similar polarities, they travel the same distance on the TLC plate and their spots overlap, appearing “on top of each other.”\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
