Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ynm6', content="The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating well, possibly due to similar properties. In a synthetic organic chemistry context, this could mean that the compounds are not separating during a purification process like chromatography. If the compounds have similar polarities, they would elute together in chromatography, making them difficult to separate. This aligns with the idea of them being 'on top of each other'.\n\nAnswer:B)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
