            "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?",
            "The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.",

        "response": "The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating or are overlapping in some way. This is most likely referring to non-covalent interactions, which can cause compounds to stack or aggregate. The other options do not directly imply that the compounds are physically overlapping or interacting in a way that would cause them to be 'on top of each other'. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that the compounds are bonding through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\n\nAnswer:A",
