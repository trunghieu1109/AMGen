Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating or are overlapping in some way. This is most likely referring to non-covalent interactions, which can cause compounds to stack or aggregate. The other options do not directly imply that the compounds are physically overlapping or interacting in a way that would cause them to be 'on top of each other'. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that the compounds are bonding through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.
