Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ynm6', content="The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating or are overlapping in some way. This is most likely referring to non-covalent interactions, which can cause compounds to stack or aggregate. The other options do not directly imply that the compounds are physically overlapping or interacting in a way that would cause them to be 'on top of each other'. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that the compounds are bonding through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\n\nAnswer:A", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
