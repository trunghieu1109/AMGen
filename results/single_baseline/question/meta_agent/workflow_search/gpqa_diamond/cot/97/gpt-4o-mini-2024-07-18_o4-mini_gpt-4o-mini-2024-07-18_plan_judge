Question: Example(question='Identify the starting material, A, in the following reaction.\nA + a methyleneruthenium compound + 1-propene ---> 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane', choice1='2-methyl-3-methylenebicyclo[2.1.0]pentane', choice2='bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-6-ene', choice3='1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane', choice4='2-methylbicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The product 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane has two exocyclic double bonds at C1 and C2 converted by cross‚Äêmetathesis: one with propene to give the propenyl substituent and one with ethylene (generated in situ) to give the vinyl substituent. The only starting material bearing two exocyclic methylene groups on a cyclopentane ring is 1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane.
