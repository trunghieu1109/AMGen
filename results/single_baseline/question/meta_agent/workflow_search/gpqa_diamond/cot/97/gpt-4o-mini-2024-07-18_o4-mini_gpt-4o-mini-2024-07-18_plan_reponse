        "response": "The product 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane has two exocyclic double bonds at C1 and C2 converted by cross\u2010metathesis: one with propene to give the propenyl substituent and one with ethylene (generated in situ) to give the vinyl substituent. The only starting material bearing two exocyclic methylene groups on a cyclopentane ring is 1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane.\n\nAnswer:C",
