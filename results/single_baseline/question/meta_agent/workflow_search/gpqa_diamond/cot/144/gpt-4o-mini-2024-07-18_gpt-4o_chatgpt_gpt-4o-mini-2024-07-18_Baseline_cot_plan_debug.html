    <pre>To determine the number of stereoisomers, we need to identify the number of stereocenters in the compound. A stereocenter can be a chiral center (a carbon with four different groups attached) or a double bond that can exhibit cis/trans (E/Z) isomerism. The compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol has the following potential stereocenters: 1) The carbon at position 5 is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a part of the carbon chain, and the rest of the carbon chain. 2) The double bonds at positions 3 and 7 can exhibit E/Z isomerism. Therefore, there are 3 stereocenters in total: one chiral center and two double bonds. The number of stereoisomers is given by 2^n, where n is the number of stereocenters. In this case, n = 3, so the number of stereoisomers is 2^3 = 8.
