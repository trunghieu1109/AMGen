Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C5) and two C=C double bonds (at C3 and C7), each able to be E/Z. Thatâ€™s 4 stereogenic elements giving 2^4 = 16 possible stereoisomers (no meso forms due to lack of symmetry).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
