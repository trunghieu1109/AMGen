Question: {'question': 'In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', 'choice1': '~ r^2', 'choice2': '~ r^4', 'choice3': '~ r^3', 'choice4': '~ r^5'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1y5S', content='Parallax plx ∝1/r. Given dN(plx)∝1/plx^5 dplx. With plx=1/r, dplx=−1/r^2 dr so |dplx|=dr/r^2. Thus dN(r)=r^5*(dr/r^2)=r^3 dr ⇒ N(r)∝r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
