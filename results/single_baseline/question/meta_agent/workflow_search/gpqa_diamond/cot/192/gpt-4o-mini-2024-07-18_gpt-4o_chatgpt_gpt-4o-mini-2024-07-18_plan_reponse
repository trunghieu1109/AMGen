            "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx ~ 1/r into this expression. This gives us the number of stars ~ (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)",
