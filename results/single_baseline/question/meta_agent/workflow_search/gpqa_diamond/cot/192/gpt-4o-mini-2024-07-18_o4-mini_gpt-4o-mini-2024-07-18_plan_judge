Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Parallax plx ∝1/r. Given dN(plx)∝1/plx^5 dplx. With plx=1/r, dplx=−1/r^2 dr so |dplx|=dr/r^2. Thus dN(r)=r^5*(dr/r^2)=r^3 dr ⇒ N(r)∝r^3.
