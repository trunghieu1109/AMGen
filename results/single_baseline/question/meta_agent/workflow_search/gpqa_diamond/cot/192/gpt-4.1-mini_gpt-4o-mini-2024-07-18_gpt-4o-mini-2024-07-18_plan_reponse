            "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r. Therefore, substituting plx into the equation gives us the number of stars as proportional to 1/(1/r)^5, which simplifies to r^5. This means that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.\n\nAnswer:D",
