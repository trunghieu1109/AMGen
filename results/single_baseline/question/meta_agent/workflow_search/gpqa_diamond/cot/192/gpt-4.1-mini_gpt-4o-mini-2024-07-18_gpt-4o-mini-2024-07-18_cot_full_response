Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent KsNs', content='The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r. Therefore, substituting plx into the equation gives us the number of stars as proportional to 1/(1/r)^5, which simplifies to r^5. This means that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
