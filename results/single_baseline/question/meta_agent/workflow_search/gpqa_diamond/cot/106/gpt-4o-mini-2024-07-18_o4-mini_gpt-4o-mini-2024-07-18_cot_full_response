Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cQKW', content='The key challenge is defining the correct ligand structures before docking. Xantheraquin has multiple chiral centers and can tautomerize, so you must enumerate all possible stereoisomers and tautomers. Then prioritize the forms most likely to be biologically active using physicochemical filters. This ensures the docking uses realistic ligand structures. Other choices either focus too narrowly (one chiral form), mix in vitro too early, or address ADME rather than proper ligand preparation.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
