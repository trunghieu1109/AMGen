Question: {'question': 'We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', 'choice1': '5.48x10^-7 M ', 'choice2': '6.24x10^-7 M', 'choice3': '2.81x10^-7 M', 'choice4': '3.97x10^-7 M '}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent k55N', content='First calculate moles: n(KH2PO4)=1.00 g/136.09 g·mol⁻¹=0.007346 mol, so [H₂PO₄⁻]=0.007346/0.200 L=0.03673 M; n(Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O)=1.00 g/177.99 g·mol⁻¹=0.005618 mol, so [HPO₄²⁻]=0.005618/0.200 L=0.02809 M. Use Henderson–Hasselbalch for H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ (pKa₂=7.208): pH=7.208+log(0.02809/0.03673)=7.094. Then for HPO₄²⁻⇌PO₄³⁻+H⁺ (Ka₃=1.8×10⁻¹²): [PO₄³⁻]=Ka₃[HPO₄²⁻]/[H⁺]=1.8×10⁻¹²×0.02809/(10⁻⁷.094)=6.24×10⁻⁷ M, matching choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
