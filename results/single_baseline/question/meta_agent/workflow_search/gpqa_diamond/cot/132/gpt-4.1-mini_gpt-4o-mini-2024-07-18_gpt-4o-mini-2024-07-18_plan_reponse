            "We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 \u00b0C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we first need to determine the moles of each phosphate compound present in the solution. KH2PO4 dissociates to give H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates to give HPO4^2-. The total concentration of orthophosphate ions will be derived from the contributions of both compounds. We will calculate the moles of each compound, convert them to concentrations, and then find the concentration of PO4^3- based on the dissociation constants provided.\n\nAnswer:5.48x10^-7 M",
