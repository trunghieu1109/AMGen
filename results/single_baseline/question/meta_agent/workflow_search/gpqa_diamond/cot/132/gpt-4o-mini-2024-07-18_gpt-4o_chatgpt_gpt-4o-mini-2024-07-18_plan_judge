Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4●2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L. The concentration of KH2PO4 is 0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M. The concentration of Na2HPO4 is 0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M. KH2PO4 is a source of H2PO4- ions, and Na2HPO4 is a source of HPO4^2- ions. The equilibrium between these species and PO4^3- is governed by the dissociation constants Ka2 and Ka3. The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is determined by the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, which is governed by Ka3. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the given Ka values, we can estimate the concentration of PO4^3-.
