Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent p2VL', content='First, calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4●2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L. The concentration of KH2PO4 is 0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M. The concentration of Na2HPO4 is 0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M. KH2PO4 is a source of H2PO4- ions, and Na2HPO4 is a source of HPO4^2- ions. The equilibrium between these species and PO4^3- is governed by the dissociation constants Ka2 and Ka3. The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is determined by the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, which is governed by Ka3. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the given Ka values, we can estimate the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
