proposed answer: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and it decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. The final transition must be to |1,0,0⟩, which requires the intermediate state to have m = 0. Therefore, the correct intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩. The transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probability given for this route is 1/3.
