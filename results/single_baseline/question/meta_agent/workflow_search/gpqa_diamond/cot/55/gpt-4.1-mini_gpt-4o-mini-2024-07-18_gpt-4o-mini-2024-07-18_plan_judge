proposed answer: To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions, we need to consider the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The allowed transitions must satisfy the change in quantum numbers: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has l=0, so it can only transition to l=1 states. The final state |1,0,0⟩ has l=0, which means the intermediate state must have l=1. The possible intermediate states from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0) to l=1 are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. We need to check the probabilities given in the choices. The probabilities must also be consistent with the allowed transitions. After analyzing the choices, the correct transition route and probability is found in choice 1, which is valid and has a probability of 1/4.
