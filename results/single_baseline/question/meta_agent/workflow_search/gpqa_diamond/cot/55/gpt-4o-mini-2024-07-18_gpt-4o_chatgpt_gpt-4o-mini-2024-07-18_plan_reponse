        "response": "The initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, and it decays to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions require \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,1\u27e9, and |2,1,-1\u27e9. The final transition must be to |1,0,0\u27e9, which requires the intermediate state to have m = 0. Therefore, the correct intermediate state is |2,1,0\u27e9. The transition route is |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9. The probability given for this route is 1/3.\n\nAnswer:B)",
