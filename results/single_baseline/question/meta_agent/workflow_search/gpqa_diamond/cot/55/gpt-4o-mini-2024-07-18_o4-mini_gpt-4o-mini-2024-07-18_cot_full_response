Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eCSc', content='We need the allowed dipole routes from 3s (n=3,l=0,m=0) to 2p (l=1,m) and then to 1s (l=0,m=0). By Wigner–Eckart the 3s→2p split equally among m=0,±1, each 1/3, and all 2p→1s decays recombine to ground. The probability via m=0 is therefore 1/3.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
