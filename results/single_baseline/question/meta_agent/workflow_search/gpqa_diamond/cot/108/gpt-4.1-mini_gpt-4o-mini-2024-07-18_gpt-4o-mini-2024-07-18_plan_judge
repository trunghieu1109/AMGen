Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to analyze the conservation of isospin, angular momentum, and parity. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy the Pauli statistics condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, we need to find the combinations of S(NN) and L(NN) that satisfy this condition. We will also consider the parity conservation, where the parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state. The parity of the initial state is positive (since 1S0 has L = 0), and the emitted particle X contributes a negative parity. Therefore, the final state must have an overall negative parity. We will analyze each choice to see if it meets these criteria.
