Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have an initial NN state 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0, T=1). Emitting X (parity –1) to a final NN state with T=0 must satisfy Pauli: T=0 ⇒ S+L+1≡0 mod2 ⇒ S+L odd. Check each final NN state:

A) 3P0: S=1, L=1 ⇒ S+L=2 (even) ⇒ violates Pauli ⇒ forbidden.
B) 7D1: S=3 (unphysical for NN), but S+L=5 (odd) ⇒ Pauli OK if S=3 were allowed.
C) 3D3: S=1, L=2 ⇒ S+L=3 (odd) ⇒ OK; J and parity conserve.
D) 3S1: S=1, L=0 ⇒ S+L=1 (odd) ⇒ OK; J and parity conserve.
