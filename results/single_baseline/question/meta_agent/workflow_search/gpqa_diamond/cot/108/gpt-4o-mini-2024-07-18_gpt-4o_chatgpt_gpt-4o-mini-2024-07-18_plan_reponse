            "Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.",

        "response": "We start with the initial state 1S0, which means S=0, L=0, J=0. The final NN state must have T(NN) = 0, and we need to check each choice to see if it satisfies the conservation laws and the Pauli statistics condition. For each choice, we check the total spin S, the orbital angular momentum L, and the total angular momentum J of the NN state, and the angular momentum l of the emitted particle X. We also check the parity conservation, where the parity of the initial state is +1 (since 1S0 has L=0) and the parity of the final state is (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l * (-1) (since X has intrinsic parity -1). We also check the Pauli statistics condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nAnswer:C)",
