    <pre>To identify compound E, we need to analyze the reaction scheme step by step. Starting from compound A, which reacts with HCN to form compound B, we can infer that compound A is likely a carbonyl compound due to the strong IR peak at 1750 cm^-1. This suggests that compound A is a ketone or an aldehyde. The reduction of compound B with H2 and Pd to form compound C indicates that compound B is likely a nitrile (since it reacts with HCN) and is reduced to an amine or an alcohol. The reaction of compound C with HNO2 suggests that it undergoes a diazotization reaction, which typically occurs with amines. Compound D then undergoes elimination to form compound E. The IR peak at 1715 cm^-1 for compound E suggests it is also a carbonyl compound, likely a ketone. We need to match the final compound E with the given choices. The choices are various ketones, and we need to determine which one fits the description of compound E based on the previous transformations and the IR data.
