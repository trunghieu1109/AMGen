        "response": "We know from the Wittig hint that A must be a substituted cyclopentanone (IR \u223c1750\u2009cm\u207b\u00b9) that gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane on reaction with an isopropyl ylide; this pins A as 4-oxo-1,2-dimethylcyclopentane (numbered as cyclopentan-1-one with two methyls). The subsequent HCN addition/reduction/diazotization/elimination sequence retains the five-membered ring and ultimately regenerates a ketone but with one additional methyl substituent (from the former nitrile carbon) on the ring. Of the choices, only 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one matches a cyclopentanone with three methyl groups and an IR carbonyl near 1715\u2009cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nAnswer:B)",
