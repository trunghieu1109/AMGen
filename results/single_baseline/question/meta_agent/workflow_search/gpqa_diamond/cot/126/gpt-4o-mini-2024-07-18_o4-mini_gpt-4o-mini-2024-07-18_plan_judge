Question: Example(question='Which of the following molecules is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated?', choice1='4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene', choice2='5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene', choice3='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', choice4='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The heating of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene undergoes the Cope rearrangement ([3,3]-sigmatropic shift), moving each double bond one position toward the center of the six-atom 1,5-diene unit.  

Original: nonane chain with double bonds at C2–C3 and C6–C7, and a butyl substituent at C5.  
After Cope: new conjugated diene internal at C3–C4 and C5–C6, but the carbon skeleton remains rearranged such that the longest chain is now 10 carbons, with substituents reclassified as ethyl at C5 and methyl at C4.  
Thus the product is 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene.
