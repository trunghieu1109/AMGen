Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: ChIP peaks that appear with PFA-only fixation but disappear when using PFA+DSG often represent ‘hyper-ChIPable’ artefacts at open chromatin regions rather than true factor binding. DSG adds extensive protein–protein crosslinks, reducing non-specific pull-downs from accessible sites. The well-known phantom peaks are enriched at DNase-hypersensitive, highly transcribed promoter and enhancer regions. Thus the disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.
