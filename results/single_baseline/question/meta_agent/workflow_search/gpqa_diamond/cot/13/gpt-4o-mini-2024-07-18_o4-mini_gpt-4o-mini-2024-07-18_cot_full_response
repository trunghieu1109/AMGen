Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MasV', content='ChIP peaks that appear with PFA-only fixation but disappear when using PFA+DSG often represent ‘hyper-ChIPable’ artefacts at open chromatin regions rather than true factor binding. DSG adds extensive protein–protein crosslinks, reducing non-specific pull-downs from accessible sites. The well-known phantom peaks are enriched at DNase-hypersensitive, highly transcribed promoter and enhancer regions. Thus the disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.\n\nAnswer:A', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
