    <pre>The question describes a scenario where ChIP-seq peaks disappear when a different fixation method (PFA+DSG) is used. This suggests that the peaks are likely associated with regions of the genome that are sensitive to the fixation method. Active promoters and enhancers are known to be more sensitive to cross-linking conditions, as they are involved in dynamic processes of transcription and may require specific fixation conditions to maintain their binding interactions. In contrast, regions like repeats or random locations in the genome are less likely to show such sensitivity. Therefore, the most likely location for the disappearing peaks is at active promoters and enhancers.
