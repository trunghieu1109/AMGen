Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: ChIP-seq is a method used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. It combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. In this scenario, the ChIP-seq was performed on a sample fixed with PFA (paraformaldehyde) and an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor. The peaks disappeared when PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation was used. DSG is a cross-linker that can stabilize protein-protein interactions more than protein-DNA interactions. If peaks disappear with DSG, it suggests that the original peaks might have been due to indirect interactions or artifacts. Active promoters and enhancers are regions where transcription factors like IKAROS are expected to bind directly. Repeats, introns of large genes, and random locations are less likely to be direct binding sites. Disappearing peaks are more likely to be artifacts or indirect interactions, which are often found at repeats or random locations.
