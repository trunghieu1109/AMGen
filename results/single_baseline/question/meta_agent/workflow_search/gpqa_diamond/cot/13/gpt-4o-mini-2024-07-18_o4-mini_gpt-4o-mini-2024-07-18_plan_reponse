            "ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?",

        "response": "ChIP peaks that appear with PFA-only fixation but disappear when using PFA+DSG often represent \u2018hyper-ChIPable\u2019 artefacts at open chromatin regions rather than true factor binding. DSG adds extensive protein\u2013protein crosslinks, reducing non-specific pull-downs from accessible sites. The well-known phantom peaks are enriched at DNase-hypersensitive, highly transcribed promoter and enhancer regions. Thus the disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.\n\nAnswer:A",
