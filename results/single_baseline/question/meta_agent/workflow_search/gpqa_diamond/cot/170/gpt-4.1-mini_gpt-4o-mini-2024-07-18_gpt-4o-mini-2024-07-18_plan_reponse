        "response": "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as -CH3 and -C2H5 will direct bromination to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as -NO2 and -COOH will direct bromination to the meta position. The order of influence on the para yield will depend on the strength of the substituents. Generally, the order of increasing para yield will be influenced by the presence of strong EWGs which will lower the para yield compared to EDGs. After analyzing the substituents, the correct order is determined to be 4<6<2<1<5<3, where 4 (NO2) has the least para yield and 3 (Cl) has the highest due to its weakly deactivating nature. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 4.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
