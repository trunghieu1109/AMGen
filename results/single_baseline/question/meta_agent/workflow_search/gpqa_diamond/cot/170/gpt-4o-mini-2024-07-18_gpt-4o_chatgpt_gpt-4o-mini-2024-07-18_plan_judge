Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups like alkyl groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) are ortho/para-directing, while deactivating groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta-directing. Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The more activating the group, the higher the para-isomer yield. Therefore, the order from least to most para-isomer yield is based on the strength of the directing effects: NO2 (strongly meta-directing) < COOC2H5 (meta-directing) < COOH (meta-directing) < Cl (ortho/para-directing but deactivating) < CH3 (ortho/para-directing) < C2H5 (ortho/para-directing).
