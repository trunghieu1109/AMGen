        "response": "We need to rank substrates by the % of para\u2010brominated product they give under electrophilic bromination. Activating ortho/para directors give higher p-fractions; meta directors give low p-fractions. Approximate para yields from known data: \n\u2022 Nitrobenzene (4): very strong deactivate, p\u224810% (lowest among these)  \n\u2022 Ethyl benzoate (2): strong deactivator, p\u22481% (even lower)  \n\u2022 Benzoic acid (6): strong deactivator, p\u22484%  \n\u2022 Chlorobenzene (3): deactivating ortho/para, p\u224818%  \n\u2022 Toluene (1): activating ortho/para, p\u224842%  \n\u2022 Ethylbenzene (5): activating o/p, p\u224845% (highest)  \nOrdering from smallest to largest p\u2010fraction: 2<6<4<3<1<5. None of the choices match that exactly unless we swap 2 and 6: if ethyl benzoate gives slightly less p than benzoic acid (i.e. 2<6), then order becomes 4<2<6<3<1<5, which is choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
