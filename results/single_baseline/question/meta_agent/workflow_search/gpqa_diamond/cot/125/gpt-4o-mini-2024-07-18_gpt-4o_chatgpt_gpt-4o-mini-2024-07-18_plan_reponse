            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "response": "Let's analyze each reaction step by step. Reaction I involves the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, which will reduce the ketone to an alcohol, resulting in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This compound is chiral, so it will show up as one peak in normal-phase HPLC and one peak in chiral HPLC. Reaction II involves the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4. NaBH4 will reduce both carbonyl groups to alcohols, resulting in pentane-2,4-diol. This compound is not chiral, so it will show up as one peak in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. Therefore, in normal-phase HPLC, we will see 2 peaks: one for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for pentane-2,4-diol. In chiral HPLC, we will see 3 peaks: one for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and two for the enantiomers of pentane-2,4-diol, which can form due to the reduction of the diketone. Thus, the correct answer is 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\nAnswer:A)",
