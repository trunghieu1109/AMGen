            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "response": "Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced by LAH to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The original chiral center at C5 remains (S), and the new center at C3 is formed as a racemic mixture, giving two diastereomers. Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is reduced by NaBH4 at both carbonyls to yield pentane-2,4-diol with two stereocenters, giving three stereoisomers (meso plus R,R and S,S enantiomers). Combined, there are 2 + 3 = 5 distinct compounds. On normal-phase (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers separate but enantiomers coelute: Reaction I yields 2 peaks, Reaction II yields 2 peaks (meso and enantiomer pair), total 4 peaks. On chiral HPLC, enantiomers are resolved: Reaction I yields 2 peaks, Reaction II yields 3 peaks, total 5 peaks.\n\nAnswer:B)",
