    <pre>In Reaction I, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced by LAH, which will convert it to an alcohol, and after acidic workup, it will remain as a single enantiomer. In Reaction II, pentane-2,4-dione is reduced by NaBH4, which will also yield a single product after acidic workup. The combination of these two reactions will yield a total of 2 distinct products. In normal-phase HPLC, these two products will likely show as 2 peaks. However, in chiral HPLC, the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one will show as one peak, and the product from pentane-2,4-dione will also show as one peak, leading to a total of 2 peaks in chiral HPLC as well. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are 2 peaks in both chiral and normal-phase HPLC.

Answer:3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC</pre>
