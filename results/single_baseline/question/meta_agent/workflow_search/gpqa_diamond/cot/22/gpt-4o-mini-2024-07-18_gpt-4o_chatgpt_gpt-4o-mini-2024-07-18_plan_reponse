            "In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?",

        "response": "The reaction of ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide is likely to proceed via a Markovnikov addition of HBr to the alkene. This would result in the formation of a carbocation at the more substituted carbon, which is the carbon adjacent to the oxygen. The carbocation can then be attacked by the bromide ion, leading to the formation of a bromo ether. The two new spots on the TLC suggest the formation of two different products, likely due to the formation of regioisomers. The most plausible structures for the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, as these are the expected products from the addition of HBr to the alkene followed by nucleophilic attack by bromide.\n\nAnswer:B)",
