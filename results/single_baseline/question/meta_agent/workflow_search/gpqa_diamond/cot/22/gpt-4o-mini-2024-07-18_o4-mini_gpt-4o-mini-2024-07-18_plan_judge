Question: Example(question='In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?', choice1='3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran', choice2='(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene', choice3='2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol', choice4='(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The allyl phenyl ether under strong HBr protonates at the alkene to give a tertiary‚Äêlike carbocation. Intramolecular attack by the aromatic oxygen can cyclize in two ways: a 6-endo cyclization gives a chromane, and a 5-exo cyclization gives a dihydrobenzofuran. Thus we expect two cyclic ethers: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, i.e. choice 1.
