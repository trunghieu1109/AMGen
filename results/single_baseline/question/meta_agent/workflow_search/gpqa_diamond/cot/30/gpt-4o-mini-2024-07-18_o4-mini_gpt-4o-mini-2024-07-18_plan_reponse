        "response": "First, nitration of toluene gives p-nitrotoluene as the major product (1). Oxidation of the benzylic methyl with MnO2/H2SO4 (2) gives p-nitrobenzaldehyde. A Claisen\u2013Schmidt condensation of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone under NaOH yields the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone (p-nitrochalcone) (3), which is planar with only the molecular plane as a symmetry element. There is no C2 or inversion center because the two para substituents (NO2 and the propenone chain) are different. Thus the symmetry group is Cs.\n\nAnswer:cs",
