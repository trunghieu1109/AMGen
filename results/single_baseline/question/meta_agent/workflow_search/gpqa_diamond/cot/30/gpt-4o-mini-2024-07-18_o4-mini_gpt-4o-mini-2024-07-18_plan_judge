Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, nitration of toluene gives p-nitrotoluene as the major product (1). Oxidation of the benzylic methyl with MnO2/H2SO4 (2) gives p-nitrobenzaldehyde. A Claisen–Schmidt condensation of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone under NaOH yields the α,β-unsaturated ketone (p-nitrochalcone) (3), which is planar with only the molecular plane as a symmetry element. There is no C2 or inversion center because the two para substituents (NO2 and the propenone chain) are different. Thus the symmetry group is Cs.

Answer:cs
Extracted answer: cs
Correct answer: 2
