        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "The product is an imine formed by condensation of 3-methylpyrrolidine with an aldehyde. Vinylcyclohexane (an alkene) cannot form the imine. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a cyclohexane\u2010carboxaldehyde) reacts with the secondary amine to give the cyclohexylidene-methyl imine. Imine formation is acid-catalyzed; p-TsOH is a common strong, non-nucleophilic acid used with heat and solvent (often with water removal) to drive the condensation. Therefore A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B is TsOH.\n\nAnswer:B)",
