Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The product is an imine formed by condensation of 3-methylpyrrolidine with an aldehyde. Vinylcyclohexane (an alkene) cannot form the imine. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a cyclohexane‚Äêcarboxaldehyde) reacts with the secondary amine to give the cyclohexylidene-methyl imine. Imine formation is acid-catalyzed; p-TsOH is a common strong, non-nucleophilic acid used with heat and solvent (often with water removal) to drive the condensation. Therefore A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B is TsOH.
