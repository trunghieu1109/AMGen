Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction, we need to analyze the final product, which is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. This product suggests that a cyclohexyl group is involved in a reaction that likely forms a double bond with the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine. The reagent A should be a compound that can provide the cyclohexylidene group, and the catalyst B should facilitate the acid-catalyzed reaction. Among the choices, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (choice 2 and 4) can provide the necessary carbonyl functionality to form the desired product through an imine formation followed by dehydration. TsOH is a strong acid that can catalyze this reaction effectively. Therefore, the best choice is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH.
