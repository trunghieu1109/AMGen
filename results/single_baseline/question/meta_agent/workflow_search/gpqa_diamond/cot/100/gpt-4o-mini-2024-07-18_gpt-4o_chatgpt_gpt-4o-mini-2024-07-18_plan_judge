Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction described involves the formation of a double bond between the cyclohexyl group and the methyl group attached to the nitrogen in 3-methylpyrrolidine. This suggests a condensation reaction where an aldehyde or ketone reacts with an amine to form an imine or enamine. The product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, indicates that a cyclohexylidene group is introduced. This is consistent with the use of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which can form an imine or enamine with the amine group in 3-methylpyrrolidine. The acid catalyst, TsOH, is suitable for facilitating this reaction by protonating the carbonyl group of the aldehyde, making it more electrophilic and promoting the formation of the imine or enamine. Therefore, the suitable reagent and catalyst are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and TsOH, respectively.
