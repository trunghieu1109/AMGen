            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "As N\u2192\u221e with fixed apothem a, the regular N\u2010gon becomes a circular aperture of radius a (diameter D=2a). The Airy pattern minimum occurs at \u03b8 given by 1.22\u00b7\u03bb/D. Here D=2a \u2192 \u03b8=1.22\u00b7\u03bb/(2a)=0.61\u00b7\u03bb/a is the half\u2010angle to the first minimum. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima on opposite sides of the central maximum, i.e. 2\u03b8=2\u00d70.61\u00b7\u03bb/a=1.22\u00b7\u03bb/a. That corresponds to choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
