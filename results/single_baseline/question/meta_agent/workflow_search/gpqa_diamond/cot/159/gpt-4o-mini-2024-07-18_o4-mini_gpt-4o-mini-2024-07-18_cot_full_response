Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent b2lz', content='As N→∞ with fixed apothem a, the regular N‐gon becomes a circular aperture of radius a (diameter D=2a). The Airy pattern minimum occurs at θ given by 1.22·λ/D. Here D=2a → θ=1.22·λ/(2a)=0.61·λ/a is the half‐angle to the first minimum. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima on opposite sides of the central maximum, i.e. 2θ=2×0.61·λ/a=1.22·λ/a. That corresponds to choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
