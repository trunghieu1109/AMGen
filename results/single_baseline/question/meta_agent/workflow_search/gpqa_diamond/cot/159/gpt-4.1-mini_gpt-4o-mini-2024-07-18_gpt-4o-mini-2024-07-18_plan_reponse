            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon approaches a circular aperture. The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern can be derived from the formula for the minima of a circular aperture, which is given by the condition for destructive interference. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first minimum is given by sin(theta) = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. In the case of a polygon with a very large number of sides, the diameter can be approximated as 2a, where a is the apothem. Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima can be calculated. The first minimum occurs at an angle of approximately 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)), and the second minimum occurs at an angle of approximately 2.44 * (lambda / (2a)). The distance between these two minima is then 1.22 * (lambda / a). Therefore, the correct answer is the first choice.\n\nAnswer:1.220 \\lambda /a",
