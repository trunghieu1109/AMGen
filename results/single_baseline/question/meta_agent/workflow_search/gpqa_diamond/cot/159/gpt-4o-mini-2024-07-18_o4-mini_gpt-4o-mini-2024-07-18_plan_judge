Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: As N→∞ with fixed apothem a, the regular N‐gon becomes a circular aperture of radius a (diameter D=2a). The Airy pattern minimum occurs at θ given by 1.22·λ/D. Here D=2a → θ=1.22·λ/(2a)=0.61·λ/a is the half‐angle to the first minimum. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima on opposite sides of the central maximum, i.e. 2θ=2×0.61·λ/a=1.22·λ/a. That corresponds to choice A).
