Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need to determine which of the six listed stars reach S/N≥10 in a 1 h exposure with ESPRESSO on a single 8 m UT. ESPRESSO’s limiting magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 h at high resolution is roughly V≈16. Compute apparent V for each star:

a) Canopus: V≈−0.7 → detectable
b) Polaris: V≈2.0 → detectable
c) Star (MV=15) at 10 pc: m=15+5·log10(10/10)=15 → detectable
d) Star (MV=15) at 200 pc: m=15+5·log10(200/10)=21.5 → too faint
e) Star (MV=15) at 5 pc: m=15+5·log10(5/10)=13.5 → detectable
f) Star (MV=15) at 50 pc: m=15+5·log10(50/10)=18.5 → too faint

Thus four stars (a, b, c, e) are detectable. That corresponds to choice1, i.e. A).
