Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The bicyclic substrate is N-allyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. It contains two π‐systems (the norbornene double bond and the N-vinyl double bond) appropriately positioned for a [3,3] sigmatropic (aza-Cope) rearrangement. The rearrangement collapses the bicyclic framework to a fused cyclopenta[c]pyridine, specifically the 3H isomer with four added hydrogens (tetrahydro), matching choice 3.
