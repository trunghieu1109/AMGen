Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Deprotonation of the 3-OH and benzylation gives the benzyl ether at C3 (product 1).
Step 2: Conversion of the C1 ketone to the tosylhydrazone (product 2).
Step 3: Treatment with n-BuLi/Bamfordâ€“Stevens or Shapiro conditions removes the C1 oxygen altogether, giving a methylene (product 3).
Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation cleaves the benzyl ether to restore the primary alcohol at C3 and saturates any C=C (product 4).
The net result is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexane, which when named as a methanol derivative is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, choice A.
