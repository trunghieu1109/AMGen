        "response": "trans-Cinnamaldehyde (C6H5\u2013CH=CH\u2013CHO) has 9 C. Reaction with MeMgBr adds one C to give Ph\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH(OH)\u2013Me (10 C). PCC oxidation gives Ph\u2013CH=CH\u2013CO\u2013Me (still 10 C). Reaction with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide adds a CH2 (epoxide formation), increasing C by 1 to 11.\n\nAnswer:C)",
