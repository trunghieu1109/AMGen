Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: trans-Cinnamaldehyde (C6H5–CH=CH–CHO) has 9 C. Reaction with MeMgBr adds one C to give Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me (10 C). PCC oxidation gives Ph–CH=CH–CO–Me (still 10 C). Reaction with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide adds a CH2 (epoxide formation), increasing C by 1 to 11.
