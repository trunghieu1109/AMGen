            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "response": "To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit: T^2 \u221d a^3. The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet can be related to its distance from the star and its albedo. The ratios of temperatures can help us find the ratios of the semi-major axes. Given the ratios of equilibrium temperatures and the albedo, we can derive the ratios of the semi-major axes and then use them to find the ratio of the orbital periods. The ratios of the temperatures are 1.4 (Planet1 to Planet2) and 2.3 (Planet2 to Planet3). We can express the semi-major axes in terms of the temperatures and then find the periods accordingly.\n\nAnswer:C",
