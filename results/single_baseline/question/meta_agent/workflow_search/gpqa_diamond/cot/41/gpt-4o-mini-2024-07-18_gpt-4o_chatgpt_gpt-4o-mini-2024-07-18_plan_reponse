            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, mass, and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature T of a planet is related to its distance from the star (d) by T \u221d d^(-1/2), assuming the albedo is constant. The orbital period P is related to the distance by Kepler's third law, P^2 \u221d d^3, so P \u221d d^(3/2). We are given the temperature ratios: T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. From these, we can find the distance ratios: d1/d2 = (T2/T1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 and d2/d3 = (T3/T2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2. The total distance ratio d1/d3 = (d1/d2) * (d2/d3). Then, we find the period ratio P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2). Calculating these gives us the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\nAnswer:C)",
