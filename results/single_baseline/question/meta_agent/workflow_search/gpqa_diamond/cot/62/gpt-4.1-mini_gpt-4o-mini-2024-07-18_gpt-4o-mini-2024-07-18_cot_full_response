Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sBLH', content="To find the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next energy state, we need to consider the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state. The energy of a photon is given by E = h * w, where h is Planck's constant and w is the angular frequency. The momentum of the photon can be calculated using p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. We will calculate the energy of the photon and then find its momentum.\n\nAnswer:p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
