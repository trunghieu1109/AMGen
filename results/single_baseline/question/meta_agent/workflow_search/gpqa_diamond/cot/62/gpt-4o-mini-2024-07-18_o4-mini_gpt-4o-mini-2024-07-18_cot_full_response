Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent HmsB', content='First identify possible excited states from fundamental v=0, J=0. Rotational transition (ΔJ=+1) gives J=1 with energy E_rot≈ħ^2/I≈9.2×10^−23 J, much smaller than vibrational quantum ħω≈4.2×10^−20 J. But pure rotational photon energy (≈9×10^−23 J) corresponds to p≈3×10^−31 N·s, not among choices. Vibrational transition obeys Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1 (from J=0→1), total energy ≈ħω+small rotational correction≈4.22×10^−20 J, so p=E/c≈1.4×10^−28 N·s, matching choice D.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
