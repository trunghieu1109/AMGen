Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next energy state, we need to consider the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state. The energy of a photon is given by E = h * w, where h is Planck's constant and w is the angular frequency. The momentum of the photon can be calculated using p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. We will calculate the energy of the photon and then find its momentum.

Answer:p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s
Extracted answer: p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s
Correct answer: 4
