        "response": "To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to determine the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule. The molecule can be modeled as a non-rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in this model are given by E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)\u0127w + BJ(J + 1), where v is the vibrational quantum number, J is the rotational quantum number, \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant, w is the angular frequency of vibration, and B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by B = \u0127^2 / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia of the molecule. The moment of inertia I is given by I = \u03bcR^2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass of the molecule, \u03bc = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). For the given molecule, Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu, so \u03bc = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 1.818 amu. Converting to kg, \u03bc = 1.818 * 1.66053906660 * 10^(-27) kg. The bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2 * 10^(-10) m. Therefore, I = \u03bcR^2 = 1.818 * 1.66053906660 * 10^(-27) kg * (2 * 10^(-10) m)^2. Now, B = \u0127^2 / (2I). The molecule is initially in the fundamental state (v = 0, J = 0) and transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is (v = 0, J = 1). The energy difference \u0394E = E(0, 1) - E(0, 0) = B(1(1 + 1)) = 2B. The momentum of the photon is given by p = \u0394E / c, where c is the speed of light. Calculate B, then \u0394E, and finally p.\n\nAnswer:C)",
