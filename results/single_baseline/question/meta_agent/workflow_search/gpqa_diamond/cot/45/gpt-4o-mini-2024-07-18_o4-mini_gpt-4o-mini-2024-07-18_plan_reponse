        "response": "We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (CH2=CH\u2013CH(CH3)\u2013CH2\u2013CH3) undergoing self-metathesis with Grubbs catalyst. Self-metathesis of R\u2013CH=CH2 gives R\u2013CH=CHR plus ethene, so excluding ethene only the dimeric internal alkene R\u2013CH=CHR is formed. In that dimer, each R\u2013 fragment still contains one chiral center (the original 3-methyl site), so there are two sp3 stereocenters (one at each end) plus the C=C double bond (E/Z). Naively that is 2^3=8 stereoisomers. There is no symmetry reduction because the R groups are chiral and none of the stereochemical combinations introduce an internal mirror plane or meso element that collapses states. Thus there are 8 distinct products (excluding ethene).\n\nAnswer:C)",
