Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene can undergo ring-closing metathesis when treated with Grubbs catalyst. The presence of the double bond allows for the formation of cyclic products. Since the compound is racemic, it has two enantiomers, which can lead to different products depending on the stereochemistry of the reaction. The number of distinct cyclic products formed will depend on the possible combinations of the double bonds and the formation of rings. After analyzing the possible outcomes, it can be determined that there are 6 distinct products formed from this reaction.
