Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5KER', content='We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3) undergoing self-metathesis with Grubbs catalyst. Self-metathesis of R–CH=CH2 gives R–CH=CHR plus ethene, so excluding ethene only the dimeric internal alkene R–CH=CHR is formed. In that dimer, each R– fragment still contains one chiral center (the original 3-methyl site), so there are two sp3 stereocenters (one at each end) plus the C=C double bond (E/Z). Naively that is 2^3=8 stereoisomers. There is no symmetry reduction because the R groups are chiral and none of the stereochemical combinations introduce an internal mirror plane or meso element that collapses states. Thus there are 8 distinct products (excluding ethene).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
