        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mixture of two enantiomers. When treated with Grubbs catalyst, a metathesis reaction occurs. The Grubbs catalyst facilitates the formation of new carbon-carbon double bonds. In this case, the metathesis can occur between the terminal alkenes of two 3-methylpent-1-ene molecules, leading to the formation of different alkenes. Since the starting material is racemic, each enantiomer can participate in the reaction, potentially leading to different stereoisomers. However, the main products will be determined by the possible combinations of the alkene positions. The possible products are: 1) 3-methyl-1-butene, 2) 3-methyl-2-pentene, 3) 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 4) 4-methyl-2-pentene. Each of these products can exist as a pair of enantiomers, but since the question asks for the number of possible products excluding ethene, we consider the distinct structural isomers. Therefore, there are 4 possible products.\n\nAnswer:A)",
