Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3) undergoing self-metathesis with Grubbs catalyst. Self-metathesis of R–CH=CH2 gives R–CH=CHR plus ethene, so excluding ethene only the dimeric internal alkene R–CH=CHR is formed. In that dimer, each R– fragment still contains one chiral center (the original 3-methyl site), so there are two sp3 stereocenters (one at each end) plus the C=C double bond (E/Z). Naively that is 2^3=8 stereoisomers. There is no symmetry reduction because the R groups are chiral and none of the stereochemical combinations introduce an internal mirror plane or meso element that collapses states. Thus there are 8 distinct products (excluding ethene).
