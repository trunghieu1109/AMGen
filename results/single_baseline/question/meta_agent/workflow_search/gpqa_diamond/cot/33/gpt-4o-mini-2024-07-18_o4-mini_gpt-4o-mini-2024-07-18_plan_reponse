            "\"1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.\nFor the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?\n3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A\n3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B\n1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C",

        "response": "The Pinacol rearrangement proceeds via protonation of the more stabilizable OH, water loss to give the more stabilized carbocation, then a 1,2\u2010shift of the adjacent group that leads to the most stabilized cation prior to C=O formation.  \n\nFor A: water loss at C4 gives a benzylic cation; migration of the ethyl side chain (rather than the methyl) places ethyl and phenyl on the migration center, yielding 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.  \nFor B: similarly, loss at C3 and a 1,2-aryl shift yields 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.  \nFor C: the acid promotes loss at C2 and a 1,2-shift of one 4-methoxyphenyl group, giving 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.  \n\nThese correspond to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C",
