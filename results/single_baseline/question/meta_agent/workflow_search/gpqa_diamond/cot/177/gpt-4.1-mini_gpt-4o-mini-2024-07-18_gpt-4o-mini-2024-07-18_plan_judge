proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \kappa in the given Lagrangian, we need to analyze the dimensions of the other components in the interaction term. The fermionic field \psi has a mass dimension of \frac{3}{2}, and the field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has a mass dimension of 2. The term \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} must have a mass dimension of 4, as it is part of the Lagrangian density. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \left[\bar{\psi}\right] + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right] + \left[\psi\right] + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right] = 4. Since \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right] = 0$, we find that \left[\kappa\right]_{M} = -1. The theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant is non-negative, which it is not in this case. Thus, the theory is not renormalizable.

Answer:The mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.
Extracted answer: The mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.
