        "response": "To determine the mass dimension of \\kappa in the given Lagrangian, we need to analyze the dimensions of the other components in the interaction term. The fermionic field \\psi has a mass dimension of \\frac{3}{2}, and the field strength tensor F^{\\mu\\nu} has a mass dimension of 2. The term \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} must have a mass dimension of 4, as it is part of the Lagrangian density. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\left[\\bar{\\psi}\\right] + \\left[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\right] + \\left[\\psi\\right] + \\left[F^{\\mu\\nu}\\right] = 4. Since \\left[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\right] = 0$, we find that \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = -1. The theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant is non-negative, which it is not in this case. Thus, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nAnswer:The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.",
