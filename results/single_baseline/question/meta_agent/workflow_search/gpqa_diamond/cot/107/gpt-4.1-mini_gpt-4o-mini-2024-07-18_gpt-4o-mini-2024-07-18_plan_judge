proposed answer: To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom, we first need to calculate the transition energy \Delta E corresponding to the given wavelength \lambda = 0.4861 \mu m. The energy can be calculated using the formula \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. After calculating \Delta E, we need to estimate the paramagnetic coupling term for the given magnetic field B = 1T and small values of m. The paramagnetic coupling term is generally proportional to the magnetic field and the magnetic moment, which is related to the quantum number m. We will then compare the two results to determine their relationship.
