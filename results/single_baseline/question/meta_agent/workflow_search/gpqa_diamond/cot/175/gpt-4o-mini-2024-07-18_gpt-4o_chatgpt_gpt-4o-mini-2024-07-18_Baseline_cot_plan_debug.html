    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices.

    <pre>To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to first find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator P. Then, we project the initial state onto the eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. After that, we apply the operator Q to this projected state and find the probability of measuring -1. 

1. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. The matrix for P is:
   P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].

2. Calculate the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

3. Solve for λ to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are 0, sqrt(2), and -sqrt(2).

4. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Solving (P - 0I)v = 0 gives the eigenvector v = [0, 1, 0].

5. Project the initial state [-1, 2, 1] onto the eigenvector [0, 1, 0]. The projection is [0, 2, 0].

6. Normalize the projected state. The norm is 2, so the normalized state is [0, 1, 0].

7. Apply the operator Q to the normalized state [0, 1, 0]. The matrix for Q is:
   Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]].

8. Calculate Q[0, 1, 0] = [0, 0, 0].

9. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of the amplitude of the component corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. The eigenvector for -1 is [0, 0, 1].

10. The amplitude is 0, so the probability is 0.

Therefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 0.
