            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

        "response": "To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to first find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator P. Then, we project the initial state onto the eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. After that, we apply the operator Q to this projected state and find the probability of measuring -1. \n\n1. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. The matrix for P is:\n   P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].\n\n2. Calculate the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\n3. Solve for \u03bb to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are 0, sqrt(2), and -sqrt(2).\n\n4. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Solving (P - 0I)v = 0 gives the eigenvector v = [0, 1, 0].\n\n5. Project the initial state [-1, 2, 1] onto the eigenvector [0, 1, 0]. The projection is [0, 2, 0].\n\n6. Normalize the projected state. The norm is 2, so the normalized state is [0, 1, 0].\n\n7. Apply the operator Q to the normalized state [0, 1, 0]. The matrix for Q is:\n   Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]].\n\n8. Calculate Q[0, 1, 0] = [0, 0, 0].\n\n9. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of the amplitude of the component corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. The eigenvector for -1 is [0, 0, 1].\n\n10. The amplitude is 0, so the probability is 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 0.\n\nAnswer:1/6",
