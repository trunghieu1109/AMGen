            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

Operator P has eigenvalues 1,\u22121,0; its 0\u2010eigenvector is |\u03c8_0\u27e9 = (1,0,\u22121)^T/\u221a2. The probability of P=0 is |\u27e8\u03c8_0|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 = (1/3). After collapse to |\u03c8_0\u27e9, measuring Q gives \u22121 with probability |\u27e8e_3|\u03c8_0\u27e9|^2 = 1/2. Overall probability = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.\n\nAnswer:B)",
