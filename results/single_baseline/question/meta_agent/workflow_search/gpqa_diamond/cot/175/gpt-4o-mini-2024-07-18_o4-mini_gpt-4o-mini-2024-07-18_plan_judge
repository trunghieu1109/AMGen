Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First normalize initial state |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1)^T/√6. Operator P has eigenvalues 1,−1,0; its 0‐eigenvector is |ψ_0⟩ = (1,0,−1)^T/√2. The probability of P=0 is |⟨ψ_0|ψ⟩|^2 = (1/3). After collapse to |ψ_0⟩, measuring Q gives −1 with probability |⟨e_3|ψ_0⟩|^2 = 1/2. Overall probability = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.
