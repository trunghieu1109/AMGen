            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

        "response": "To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we first need to determine the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operators P and Q. The measurement of P will collapse the state into one of its eigenstates, and then we will measure Q. We will calculate the probabilities based on the eigenstates and the initial state of the system.\n\nAnswer:1/3",
