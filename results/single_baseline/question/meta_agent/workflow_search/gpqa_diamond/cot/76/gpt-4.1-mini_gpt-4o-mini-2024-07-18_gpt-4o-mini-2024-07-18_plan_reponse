            "The Cope rearrangement is a chemical reaction where a 1,5-diene molecule undergoes rearrangement, resulting in a change in the positions of its carbon-carbon double bonds. This rearrangement can be initiated by heat or light and is valuable for creating complex organic compounds with changed structures.\nSelect the major products from the following rearrangements.\n(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1.

The Cope rearrangement typically involves the migration of double bonds in a diene system, and the products should reflect the structural changes that occur during this rearrangement. By comparing the choices, we can identify which ones are consistent with the expected outcomes of the reactions.\n\nAnswer:A = (Z)-2-methyl-5-phenylpent-2-en-1-ol, B = 2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzo[3,4]azuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene",
