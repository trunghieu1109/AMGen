Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question describes two mutations: a recessive loss-of-function mutation X in the transactivation domain and a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation typically interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often leading to a loss of function. In this case, mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, which is crucial for the transcription factor to form functional dimers. Therefore, the presence of mutation Y would likely disrupt the ability of the transcription factor to dimerize properly, leading to a loss of function. Among the choices provided, the most fitting outcome of a dominant-negative mutation affecting dimerization would be 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', as the wild-type allele would not be able to function properly in the presence of the dominant-negative mutation.
