Question: {'question': 'In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', 'choice1': 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', 'choice2': 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', 'choice3': 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', 'choice4': 'change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZF91', content='A dominant-negative mutation in a dimerization domain typically allows the mutant protein to still bind the wild-type subunit, forming nonfunctional complexes (often aggregating or sequestering the wild-type), thus causing a loss-of-function despite one normal allele. This fits the description of protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
