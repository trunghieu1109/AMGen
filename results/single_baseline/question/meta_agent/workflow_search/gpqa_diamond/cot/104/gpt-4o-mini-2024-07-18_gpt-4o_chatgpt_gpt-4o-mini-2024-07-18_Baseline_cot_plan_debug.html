    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star&#39;s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~0.07&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~0.32&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~0.11&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~0.39&#39;}

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and equate it to the change in brightness due to a transiting exoplanet. The star has a temperature of 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so they are at 5000K. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the total surface area of the star. The brightness of a blackbody is proportional to T^4, so the brightness ratio of the spots to the unspotted surface is (5000/6000)^4. The total brightness of the star is reduced by the spots, and we calculate this reduction. For the exoplanet, the reduction in brightness is proportional to the area ratio (Rpl/Rstar)^2. We set these two reductions equal to find Rpl/Rstar.
