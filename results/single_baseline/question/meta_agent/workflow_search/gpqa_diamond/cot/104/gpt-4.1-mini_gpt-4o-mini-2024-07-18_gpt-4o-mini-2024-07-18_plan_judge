Question: Example(question="Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?", choice1='~0.07', choice2='~0.32', choice3='~0.11', choice4='~0.39', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the dark spots, we need to consider the effect of the dark spots on the star's brightness. The filling factor of the spots is 20%, and they are cooler than the surrounding area. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, making their temperature 5000K. The brightness variation due to the spots can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the brightness (or flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. We can calculate the brightness of the star with and without the spots and find the equivalent radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation. After performing the calculations, we find that the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star is approximately 0.11 times the radius of the star, which corresponds to choice 3.
