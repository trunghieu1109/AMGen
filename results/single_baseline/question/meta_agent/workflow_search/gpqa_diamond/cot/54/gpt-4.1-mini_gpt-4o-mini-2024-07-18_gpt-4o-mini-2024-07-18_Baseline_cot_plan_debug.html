    <pre>To identify the unknown compound based on the provided 1H NMR data, we need to analyze the chemical shifts and splitting patterns. The presence of a doublet at 7.0 ppm suggests a proton on an aromatic or alkene system, while the chemical shift at 5.5 ppm indicates a proton on a vinyl group. The singlet at 2.1 ppm corresponds to a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (acetate), and the doublet at 1.6 ppm indicates another methyl group. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts suggest that the compound is likely an alkene with specific stereochemistry. Given the options, we can deduce that the presence of the doublet at 7.0 ppm and the vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm aligns more with the trans isomer due to the coupling constants and the chemical environment. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely Trans-propenyl acetate.
