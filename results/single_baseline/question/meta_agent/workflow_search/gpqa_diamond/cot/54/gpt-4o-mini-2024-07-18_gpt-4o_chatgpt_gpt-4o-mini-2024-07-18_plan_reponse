        "response": "The 1H NMR data shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm with a coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz, which indicates a trans-alkene. The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, suggesting a vinyl proton adjacent to a methyl group. The signal at 2.1 ppm is a singlet, likely from an acetyl group (CH3CO-). The signal at 1.6 ppm is a doublet, indicating a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) confirms the trans configuration of the alkene. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nAnswer:A)",
