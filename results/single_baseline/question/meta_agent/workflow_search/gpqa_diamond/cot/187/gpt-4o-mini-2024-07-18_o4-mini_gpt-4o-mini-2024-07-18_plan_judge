Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a rhombohedral cell with a = 10 Å and α = β = γ = 30°. The direct metric tensor g has diagonal entries g_ii = a^2 = 100 and off-diagonals g_ij = a^2 cosα = 100·(√3/2) ≈ 86.6025. The reciprocal metric g* = g–1 has eigenvalues 1/(a+2q) for [1,1,1] direction and 1/(a–q) for the other two orthogonal directions, where p = 100 and q = 86.6025. For the (1,1,1) plane, the quadratic form is hᵀg* h = 3/(p+2q) = 3/(100+2·86.6025) = 0.010982, so d₁₁₁² = 1/0.010982 ≈ 91.05, yielding d₁₁₁ ≈ 9.545 Å which matches choice A.
