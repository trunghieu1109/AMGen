Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent yKZ9', content='We have a rhombohedral cell with a = 10 Å and α = β = γ = 30°. The direct metric tensor g has diagonal entries g_ii = a^2 = 100 and off-diagonals g_ij = a^2 cosα = 100·(√3/2) ≈ 86.6025. The reciprocal metric g* = g–1 has eigenvalues 1/(a+2q) for [1,1,1] direction and 1/(a–q) for the other two orthogonal directions, where p = 100 and q = 86.6025. For the (1,1,1) plane, the quadratic form is hᵀg* h = 3/(p+2q) = 3/(100+2·86.6025) = 0.010982, so d₁₁₁² = 1/0.010982 ≈ 91.05, yielding d₁₁₁ ≈ 9.545 Å which matches choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
