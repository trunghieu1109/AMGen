        "response": "We have a rhombohedral cell with a = 10 \u00c5 and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30\u00b0. The direct metric tensor g has diagonal entries g_ii = a^2 = 100 and off-diagonals g_ij = a^2 cos\u03b1 = 100\u00b7(\u221a3/2) \u2248 86.6025. The reciprocal metric g* = g\u20131 has eigenvalues 1/(a+2q) for [1,1,1] direction and 1/(a\u2013q) for the other two orthogonal directions, where p = 100 and q = 86.6025. For the (1,1,1) plane, the quadratic form is h\u1d40g* h = 3/(p+2q) = 3/(100+2\u00b786.6025) = 0.010982, so d\u2081\u2081\u2081\u00b2 = 1/0.010982 \u2248 91.05, yielding d\u2081\u2081\u2081 \u2248 9.545 \u00c5 which matches choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)",
