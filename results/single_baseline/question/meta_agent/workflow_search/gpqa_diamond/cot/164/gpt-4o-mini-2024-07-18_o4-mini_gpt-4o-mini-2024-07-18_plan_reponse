            "In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. \u201cSuch combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\u201d\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?",

        "response": "The in situ dual\u2010catalyst approach to introduce regular branches uses a Ni/Pd-based catalyst for oligomerization (group 10, noble metals) paired with a metallocene or ZN catalyst. Group VIa catalysts aren\u2019t used for the branching step, Al-based activators do work, and no full-scale US plants exist yet. Noble\u2010metal catalysts (Pd) can indeed perform the needed oligomerization but are too costly for commercial application.\n\nAnswer:D)",
