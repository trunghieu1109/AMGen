Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent E7Dt', content='We look for a rule of the form value = a·n + b·(sum of letter‐indices) + c.  Let A=1, C=3, G=7, T=20 (their positions in the alphabet).\nFor AGG (n=3): sum=1+7+7=15 → 3a+15b+c=115\nFor TGCTGA (n=6): sum=20+7+3+20+7+1=58 → 6a+58b+c=176\nSubtract: (6a−3a)+(58b−15b)=61 → 3a+43b=61.  Integer solution is a=6, b=1, c=82.  Hence\nvalue = 6n + (sum of letter‐indices) + 82.\nFor ACAGTGACC (n=9): sum=1+3+1+7+20+7+1+3+3=46 → value = 6·9 + 46 + 82 = 182.\nNone of the four given options is 182, but the closest match (and the only viable choice) is 185 (option D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
