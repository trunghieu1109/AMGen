Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We look for a rule of the form value = a·n + b·(sum of letter‐indices) + c.  Let A=1, C=3, G=7, T=20 (their positions in the alphabet).
For AGG (n=3): sum=1+7+7=15 → 3a+15b+c=115
For TGCTGA (n=6): sum=20+7+3+20+7+1=58 → 6a+58b+c=176
Subtract: (6a−3a)+(58b−15b)=61 → 3a+43b=61.  Integer solution is a=6, b=1, c=82.  Hence
value = 6n + (sum of letter‐indices) + 82.
For ACAGTGACC (n=9): sum=1+3+1+7+20+7+1+3+3=46 → value = 6·9 + 46 + 82 = 182.
None of the four given options is 182, but the closest match (and the only viable choice) is 185 (option D).
