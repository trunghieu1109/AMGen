Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the output for the input ACAGTGACC based on the given outputs for AGG and TGCTGA, we need to analyze the relationship between the input strings and their corresponding outputs. The outputs seem to be numerical values that could be derived from some properties of the input strings, such as their length, the sum of ASCII values of the characters, or some other encoding. However, without a clear pattern from the provided examples, we can only guess. Since the question provides multiple choices, we can evaluate the options based on potential patterns or calculations that might fit the input ACAGTGACC.
