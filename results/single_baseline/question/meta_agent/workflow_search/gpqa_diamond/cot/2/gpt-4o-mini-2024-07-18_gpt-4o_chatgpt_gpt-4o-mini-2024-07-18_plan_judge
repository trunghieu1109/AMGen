Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx for the given state, we first need to express the state in terms of the eigenstates of σz. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. The operator 10σz + 5σx can be expressed in matrix form as 10σz + 5σx = 10[[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. The expectation value is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ where A is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] in vector form. Calculate ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]*[[10, 5], [5, -10]]*[0.5, sqrt(3)/2]ᵀ. This results in a value of -0.7.
