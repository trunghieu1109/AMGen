Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The state is |ψ⟩=0.5|↑⟩+√3/2|↓⟩. We need ⟨10σ_z+5σ_x⟩=10⟨σ_z⟩+5⟨σ_x⟩. 
⟨σ_z⟩=|0.5|^2−|√3/2|^2=0.25−0.75=−0.5 ⇒10(−0.5)=−5.
⟨σ_x⟩=2Re(0.5·√3/2)=√3/2≈0.8660 ⇒5·0.8660≈4.3301.
Sum=−5+4.3301=−0.6699≈−0.7, which is choice D.
