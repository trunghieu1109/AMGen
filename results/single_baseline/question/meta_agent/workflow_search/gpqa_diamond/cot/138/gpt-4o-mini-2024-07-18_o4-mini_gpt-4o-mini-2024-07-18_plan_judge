Question: Example(question='Two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Through the mentioned treatment two different diketones are produced. Select the proper starting materials A and B for the reactions.\nA + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\nB + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione', choice1='A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol', choice2='A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol', choice3='A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one', choice4='A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reaction of vicinal diols with nitrous acid under acidic aqueous conditions leads to oxidation to vicinal diketones. For B, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol is the vicinal diol precursor to 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. For A, 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol under HCl/H₂O loses the methoxy to give the 1,2-diol, which is then oxidized by HNO₂ to the 1,2-dione. Thus the correct choice is choice2.
