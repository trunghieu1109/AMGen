Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The enamine is alkylated at the α‐carbon of the ketone by first deprotonating (LDA) to give the metalloenamine, then trapping with ethyl iodide, and finally hydrolyzing to regenerate the ketone. This yields heptan‐4‐one. The correct stepwise sequence is (i) LDA, DME (solvent), (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+. Matching the choices, this is choice 4.
