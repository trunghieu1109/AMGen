        "response": "The enamine is alkylated at the \u03b1\u2010carbon of the ketone by first deprotonating (LDA) to give the metalloenamine, then trapping with ethyl iodide, and finally hydrolyzing to regenerate the ketone. This yields heptan\u20104\u2010one. The correct stepwise sequence is (i) LDA, DME (solvent), (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+. Matching the choices, this is choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
