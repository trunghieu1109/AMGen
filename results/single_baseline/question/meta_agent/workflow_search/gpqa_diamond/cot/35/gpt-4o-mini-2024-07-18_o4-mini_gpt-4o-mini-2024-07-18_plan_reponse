            "Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?",

        "response": "The observed line energy of 3.9\u00d710^-6 eV corresponds to a frequency of ~943 MHz (wavelength ~31.8 cm). This is the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine HI line (rest energy ~5.9\u00d710^-6 eV). In the Milky Way, 21 cm absorption arises in the cold neutral atomic medium (low spin temperature). Thus the line would be seen against background radio sources as absorption by cold atomic hydrogen.\n\nAnswer:B)",
