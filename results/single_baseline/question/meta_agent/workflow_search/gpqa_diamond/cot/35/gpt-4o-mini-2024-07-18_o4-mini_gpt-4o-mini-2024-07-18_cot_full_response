Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gCuk', content='The observed line energy of 3.9×10^-6 eV corresponds to a frequency of ~943 MHz (wavelength ~31.8 cm). This is the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine HI line (rest energy ~5.9×10^-6 eV). In the Milky Way, 21 cm absorption arises in the cold neutral atomic medium (low spin temperature). Thus the line would be seen against background radio sources as absorption by cold atomic hydrogen.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
