            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "To identify compound X, we need to analyze the given NMR data and match it with the possible structures. The 1H NMR shows signals at \u03b4 2.28 and 2.31, which are singlets for 3 hydrogens each, likely indicating two methyl groups. The aromatic region shows signals at \u03b4 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71, which are consistent with a substituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR shows signals at \u03b4 21.3 and 28.4, which are likely the two methyl carbons. The signals at \u03b4 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3 are typical for aromatic carbons. The signals at \u03b4 141.5 and 144.1 could be for the quaternary carbons in the aromatic ring or the alkene. The signal at \u03b4 197.7 is indicative of a carbonyl carbon, suggesting the presence of a ketone. Among the choices, '2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane' fits the NMR data well, as it has a ketone and the correct number of methyl groups and aromatic protons.\n\nAnswer:C)",
