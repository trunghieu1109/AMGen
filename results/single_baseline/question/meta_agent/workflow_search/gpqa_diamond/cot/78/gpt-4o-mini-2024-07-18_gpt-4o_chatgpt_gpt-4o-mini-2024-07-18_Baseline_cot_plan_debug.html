    <pre>To identify compound X, we need to analyze the given NMR data and match it with the possible structures. The 1H NMR shows signals at δ 2.28 and 2.31, which are singlets for 3 hydrogens each, likely indicating two methyl groups. The aromatic region shows signals at δ 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71, which are consistent with a substituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR shows signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4, which are likely the two methyl carbons. The signals at δ 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3 are typical for aromatic carbons. The signals at δ 141.5 and 144.1 could be for the quaternary carbons in the aromatic ring or the alkene. The signal at δ 197.7 is indicative of a carbonyl carbon, suggesting the presence of a ketone. Among the choices, &#39;2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane&#39; fits the NMR data well, as it has a ketone and the correct number of methyl groups and aromatic protons.
