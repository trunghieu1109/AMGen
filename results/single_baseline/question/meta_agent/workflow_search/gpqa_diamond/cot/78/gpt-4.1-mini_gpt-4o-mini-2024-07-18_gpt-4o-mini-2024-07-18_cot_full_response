Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OOE7', content='To identify Compound X (C11H12O), I will analyze the provided NMR data. The 1H NMR shows signals that suggest the presence of methyl groups (δ 2.28 and 2.31), aromatic protons (δ 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, 7.71), and the structure likely contains an epoxide due to the presence of oxygen. The 13C NMR confirms the presence of aromatic carbons and suggests a structure consistent with a substituted styrene derivative. I will compare the choices with the molecular formula and the NMR data to find the best match.\n\nAnswer:2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
