Question: Example(question='In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.', choice1='2-styrylepoxide', choice2='2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', choice3='2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', choice4='2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The NMR shows two methyl singlets (δ2.28, 2.31), two vinyl protons (d,d, trans), and a p-disubstituted aromatic (2H + 2H). This matches 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (one methyl on ring, one methyl on epoxide side chain). Other options lack the required two methyls or correct aromatic pattern.

Answer:B)
