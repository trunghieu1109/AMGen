Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent anOO', content='The NMR shows two methyl singlets (δ2.28, 2.31), two vinyl protons (d,d, trans), and a p-disubstituted aromatic (2H + 2H). This matches 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (one methyl on ring, one methyl on epoxide side chain). Other options lack the required two methyls or correct aromatic pattern.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
