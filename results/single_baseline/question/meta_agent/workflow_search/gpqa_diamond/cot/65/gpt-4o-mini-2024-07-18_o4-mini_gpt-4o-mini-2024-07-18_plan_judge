Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: SMEFT operators must respect spacetime symmetries and CPT by the CPT theorem. Poincare invariance includes Lorentz invariance, but since both are listed, we include them separately. CP is not required (can be violated). Thus the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT), corresponding to choice4.
