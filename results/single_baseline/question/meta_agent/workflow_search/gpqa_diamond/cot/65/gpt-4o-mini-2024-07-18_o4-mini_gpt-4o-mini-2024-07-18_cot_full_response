Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent prTO', content='SMEFT operators must respect spacetime symmetries and CPT by the CPT theorem. Poincare invariance includes Lorentz invariance, but since both are listed, we include them separately. CP is not required (can be violated). Thus the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT), corresponding to choice4.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
