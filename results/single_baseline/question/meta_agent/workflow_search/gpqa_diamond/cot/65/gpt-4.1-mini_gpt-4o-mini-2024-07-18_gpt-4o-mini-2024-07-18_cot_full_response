Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TOTF', content='In the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we need to consider which symmetries are fundamental and must be respected by all operators. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime, and Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. CP symmetry is a discrete symmetry related to charge conjugation and parity transformations, while CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity transformation, and time reversal, which is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory. Therefore, the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not necessarily required for all operators. Thus, the correct choice includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nAnswer:1,2,4', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
