Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TOTF', content='The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain fundamental symmetries. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime that must be respected by all physical theories, including SMEFT. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations, is also a fundamental symmetry of spacetime. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry that combines charge conjugation (C), parity transformation (P), and time reversal (T), and is respected by all local quantum field theories, including SMEFT. CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not a fundamental symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, as CP violation is observed in nature. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
