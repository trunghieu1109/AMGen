Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and a halogen, with 8 carbons total. The only structure fitting this is a chloroacetophenone (acetyl group plus Cl). A para-disubstituted benzene gives two sets of equivalent aromatic protons (2H each) appearing as doublets around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, plus the acetyl methyl singlet around 2.3 ppm. This matches choice 4.
