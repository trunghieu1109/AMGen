Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To identify the correct 1H NMR data for the di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, we need to consider the expected chemical shifts for protons in such a structure. Aromatic protons typically resonate in the range of 6.0 to 8.0 ppm. The presence of a carbonyl group may influence the chemical shifts of nearby protons. The choices provided include various chemical shifts, and we need to find the one that fits the expected pattern for an aromatic compound with the specified substituents.
