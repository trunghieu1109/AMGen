Question: Example(question='Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:', choice1='Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice2='Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice3='Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice4='Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to consider the geometry of the situation. The probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P(transit) = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where R_star is the radius of the star, R_planet is the radius of the planet (which is negligible compared to R_star), and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radii, the probability of transit is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the star M_star by Kepler's third law: a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star. For Planet_1, the orbital period is three times shorter than that of Planet_2, so P_1 = P_2 / 3. The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet_2, so M_star1 = 2 * M_star2. Using Kepler's third law, we find that a_1^3 ∝ (P_2 / 3)^2 * (2 * M_star2) = (P_2^2 / 9) * 2 * M_star2 = (2/9) * P_2^2 * M_star2. For Planet_2, a_2^3 ∝ P_2^2 * M_star2. Therefore, a_1^3 / a_2^3 = (2/9), so a_1 / a_2 = (2/9)^(1/3). The probability ratio P(transit_1) / P(transit_2) = a_2 / a_1 = (9/2)^(1/3). Calculating this gives approximately 1.65. Therefore, Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
