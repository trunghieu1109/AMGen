Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iFHe', content='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It is specifically valid for a trap-free single-carrier device where the current is limited by the space charge of the carriers. The equation assumes that there is no barrier to carrier injection, meaning the contacts are Ohmic, and that the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current. Therefore, the correct statement should reflect these conditions.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
