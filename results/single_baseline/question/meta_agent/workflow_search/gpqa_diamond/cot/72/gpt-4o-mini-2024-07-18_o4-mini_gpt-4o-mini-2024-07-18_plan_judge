Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Calculate gamma factors: γ1=1/√(1−0.6²)=1.25, γ2=1/√(1−0.5²)≈1.1547. Energies: E1=γ1·2m c²=2.5 mc², E2=γ2·3m c²≈3.4641 mc², so E_total≈5.9641 mc²≈5.96 mc². Relative speed: (0.6c−0.5c)/(1−0.6·0.5)=0.1c/0.7≈0.1429c≈0.14c.
