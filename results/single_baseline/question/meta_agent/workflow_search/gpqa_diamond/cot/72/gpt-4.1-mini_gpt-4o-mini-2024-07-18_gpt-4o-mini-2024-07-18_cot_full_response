Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent y8Fe', content='To find the relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2 / c^2)). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging in these values, we calculate the relative speed. For the total energy, we need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut using E = γmc^2, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). We calculate γ for each astronaut and then find the total energy of the system by summing their energies.\n\nAnswer:v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
