            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The presence of two peaks for the same \u03b1\u2010proton with equal integrals and similar shifts, independent of spin\u2013spin coupling, suggests two stereoisomers. LC\u2013MS shows two chromatographically resolved peaks of identical mass (same molecule), which indicates diastereomers rather than enantiomers (enantiomers wouldn\u2019t separate on an achiral column). This points to epimerization at the \u03b1\u2010carbon during synthesis, yielding a diastereomeric mixture.\n\nAnswer:B)",
