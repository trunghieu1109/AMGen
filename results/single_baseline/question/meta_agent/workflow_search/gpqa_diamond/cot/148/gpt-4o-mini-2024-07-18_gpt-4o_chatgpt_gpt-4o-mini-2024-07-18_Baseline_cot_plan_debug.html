    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#34;&#39;Double coupling&#39; has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction&#34;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The compound is contaminated with a precursor&#39;}

    <pre>The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, suggesting the presence of two chemically distinct environments for the same proton. The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensities with the same mass spectrum, indicating the presence of two species with the same mass. The fact that the peaks have equal integrals and intensities suggests that these species are present in equal amounts. The presence of two peaks in both NMR and LC-MS that are consistent with the expected molecule suggests that the compound exists in two different forms that are not enantiomers (since enantiomers would not show separate peaks in NMR or LC-MS under these conditions). Diastereoisomers, however, can have different chemical environments and can show separate peaks in NMR and LC-MS. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
