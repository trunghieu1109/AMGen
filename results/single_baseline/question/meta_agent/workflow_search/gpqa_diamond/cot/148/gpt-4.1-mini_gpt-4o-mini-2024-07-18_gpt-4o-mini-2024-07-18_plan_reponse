            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton in the 1H NMR spectrum, along with the fact that they have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, suggests that the compound may exist in two different forms that are not due to spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis showing two peaks of equal intensities with the same mass spectrum further supports the idea that there are two distinct forms of the compound. Given the options, the most plausible explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this would account for the observed NMR peaks and the LC-MS results.\n\nAnswer:B",
