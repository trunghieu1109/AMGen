Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To convert the sequential computation of the matrix exponential via a rational (fractional) approximation into a parallel algorithm, one uses partial fraction decomposition. This breaks the approximation into a sum of independent terms (each involving an inverse of a shifted matrix), which can be computed in parallel. Other factors like boundary conditions or stability analysis are important but do not directly enable parallelization the way linear partial fraction decomposition does.
