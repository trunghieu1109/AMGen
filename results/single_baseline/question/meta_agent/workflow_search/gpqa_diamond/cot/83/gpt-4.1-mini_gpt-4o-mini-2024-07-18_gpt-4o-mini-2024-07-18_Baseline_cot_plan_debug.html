    <pre>To convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, one typically needs to identify a key factor that allows for the distribution of computations across multiple processors. In the context of numerical methods for solving differential equations, this often involves understanding how the problem can be decomposed or how dependencies can be managed. The options provided suggest various aspects of numerical methods, but the most relevant to parallelization is often related to the structure of the problem and how it can be split into independent tasks. Among the choices, &#39;Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation&#39; seems to relate to how the approximation can be structured for parallel computation, while the others do not directly address the parallelization aspect as clearly.
