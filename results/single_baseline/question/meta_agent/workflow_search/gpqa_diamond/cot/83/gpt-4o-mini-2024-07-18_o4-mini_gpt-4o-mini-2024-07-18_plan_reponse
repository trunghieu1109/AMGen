        "response": "To convert the sequential computation of the matrix exponential via a rational (fractional) approximation into a parallel algorithm, one uses partial fraction decomposition. This breaks the approximation into a sum of independent terms (each involving an inverse of a shifted matrix), which can be computed in parallel. Other factors like boundary conditions or stability analysis are important but do not directly enable parallelization the way linear partial fraction decomposition does.\n\nAnswer:C)",
