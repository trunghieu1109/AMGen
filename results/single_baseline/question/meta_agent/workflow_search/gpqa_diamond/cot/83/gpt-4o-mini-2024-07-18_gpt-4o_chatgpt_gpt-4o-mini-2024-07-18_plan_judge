Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, one must consider how the computations can be divided and executed concurrently. In the context of approximating the matrix exponential function using a fractional approximation, the key factor would likely involve the structure of the approximation itself. The linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation suggests a way to decompose the problem into smaller, independent parts that can be computed in parallel. This decomposition is crucial for parallelization, as it allows different processors to work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. Therefore, the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation is the key factor in enabling parallel computation.
