            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).",
            "A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate",

        "n": "Baseline cot",
        "response": "Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) does not undergo keto\u2013enol tautomerism due to its aromatic stabilization and cannot form the enol tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily tautomerizes to its enol form. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (\u2013CHOH\u2013) and exhibits optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers. Thus, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
