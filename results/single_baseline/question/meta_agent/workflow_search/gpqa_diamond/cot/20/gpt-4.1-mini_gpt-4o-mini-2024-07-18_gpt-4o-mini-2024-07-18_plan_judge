Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone can exhibit tautomerism due to the presence of a carbonyl group, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not have such a feature and is more stable in its structure. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. For the second part, we need to identify which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and is symmetrical, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist as enantiomers. Thus, it shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct choices are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Answer:A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
Extracted answer: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
Correct answer: 3
