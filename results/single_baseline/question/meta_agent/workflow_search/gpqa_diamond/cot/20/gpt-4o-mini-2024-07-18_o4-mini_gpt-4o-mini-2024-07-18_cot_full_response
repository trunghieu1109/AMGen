Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) does not undergo keto–enol tautomerism due to its aromatic stabilization and cannot form the enol tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily tautomerizes to its enol form. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (–CHOH–) and exhibits optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers. Thus, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
