Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The scientist is running qPCR with known concentrations and measuring the Ct values. The efficiency of 100% and slope of -3.3 indicate that a ten-fold dilution should result in a Ct increase of 3.3 cycles. The Ct values provided for each concentration are consistent with this expectation, as each ten-fold dilution results in an increase of approximately 3.3 cycles. However, the deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3 cycles, which is higher than typically acceptable for qPCR technical replicates. Therefore, the discrepancies in the results are best explained by the deviation between technical replicates being more than 0.3.
