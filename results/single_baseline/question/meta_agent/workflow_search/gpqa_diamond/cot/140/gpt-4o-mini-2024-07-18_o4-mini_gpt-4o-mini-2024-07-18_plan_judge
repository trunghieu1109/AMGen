Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Benzyne intermediate can form by elimination of D at C2 or H at C6, giving two different benzynes. Each benzyne can be attacked by NH2â€“ at either end, then protonated, yielding two products per pathway. Thus there are 4 possible organic products.
