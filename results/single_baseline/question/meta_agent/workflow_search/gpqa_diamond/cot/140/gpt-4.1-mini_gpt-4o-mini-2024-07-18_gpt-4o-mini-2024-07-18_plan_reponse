        "response": "1-bromobenzene-2-d is an aromatic compound with a bromine substituent and a deuterium substituent. When treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, the bromine can be replaced by a nucleophile. The reaction can lead to the formation of different products depending on the position of the nucleophile's attack. Given the structure, we can analyze the possible positions for substitution. The nucleophile can attack at the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the deuterium. However, since the deuterium is at the 2-position, the ortho position is already occupied by deuterium, limiting the possible products. Therefore, we can have substitution at the meta and para positions, leading to two distinct products. Thus, the total number of possible organic products is 2.\n\nAnswer:2",
