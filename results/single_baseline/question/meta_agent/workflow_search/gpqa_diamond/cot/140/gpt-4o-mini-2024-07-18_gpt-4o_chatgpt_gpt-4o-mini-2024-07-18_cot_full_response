Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 06t4', content='1-bromobenzene-2-d is a bromobenzene with a deuterium atom at the 2-position. When treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, a benzyne intermediate can form. The benzyne can undergo nucleophilic attack by the amide ion (NH2-) at either of the two positions adjacent to the triple bond, leading to two possible aniline derivatives. Additionally, the deuterium can end up in different positions due to the benzyne mechanism. Therefore, there are multiple possible products.\n\nAnswer:4', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
