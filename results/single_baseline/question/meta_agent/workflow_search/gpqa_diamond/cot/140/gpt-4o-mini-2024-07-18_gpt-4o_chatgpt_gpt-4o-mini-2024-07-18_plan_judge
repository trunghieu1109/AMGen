Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a bromobenzene with a deuterium atom at the 2-position. When treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, a benzyne intermediate can form. The benzyne can undergo nucleophilic attack by the amide ion (NH2-) at either of the two positions adjacent to the triple bond, leading to two possible aniline derivatives. Additionally, the deuterium can end up in different positions due to the benzyne mechanism. Therefore, there are multiple possible products.
