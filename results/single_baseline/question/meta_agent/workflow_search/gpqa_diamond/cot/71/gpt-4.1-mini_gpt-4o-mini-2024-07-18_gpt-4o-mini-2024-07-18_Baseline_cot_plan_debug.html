    <pre>To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4, we need to analyze the structure of the compound after each step of the reaction. The initial compound has a bicyclic structure with tert-butoxy and diene functionalities. The reaction with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide likely leads to a substitution or addition reaction that modifies the hydrogen count. The subsequent treatment with sulfuric acid and then with SO3 and pyridine suggests further functionalization, possibly leading to sulfonation. Finally, heating at 150C may lead to rearrangements or eliminations that affect the hydrogen count. After considering the transformations and the final structure, we can count the distinct hydrogen atoms. The options provided are 7, 8, 10, and 4. Based on the analysis, the correct count of distinct hydrogen atoms is 8.
