Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The sequence is benzyne Diels–Alder on norbornadiene → triptycene; acid removes t-BuO to give bridgehead OH; SO3/pyridine DMSO oxidizes the tertiary alcohol to a bridgehead ketone; heating thermally extrudes CO (cheletropic extrusion) to give anthracene (C14H10). Anthracene has 10 H but only 4 chemically distinct types (the H at positions 1/8, 2/7, 3/6, and 4/5 are each equivalent by symmetry).

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
