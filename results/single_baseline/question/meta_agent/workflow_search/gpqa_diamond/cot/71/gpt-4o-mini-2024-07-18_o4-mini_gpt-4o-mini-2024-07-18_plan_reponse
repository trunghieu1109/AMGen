        "response": "The sequence is benzyne Diels\u2013Alder on norbornadiene \u2192 triptycene; acid removes t-BuO to give bridgehead OH; SO3/pyridine DMSO oxidizes the tertiary alcohol to a bridgehead ketone; heating thermally extrudes CO (cheletropic extrusion) to give anthracene (C14H10). Anthracene has 10 H but only 4 chemically distinct types (the H at positions 1/8, 2/7, 3/6, and 4/5 are each equivalent by symmetry).\n\nAnswer:D)",
