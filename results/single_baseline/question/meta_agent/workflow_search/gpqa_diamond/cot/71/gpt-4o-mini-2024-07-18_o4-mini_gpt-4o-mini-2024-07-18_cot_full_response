Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent YIuK', content='The sequence is benzyne Diels–Alder on norbornadiene → triptycene; acid removes t-BuO to give bridgehead OH; SO3/pyridine DMSO oxidizes the tertiary alcohol to a bridgehead ketone; heating thermally extrudes CO (cheletropic extrusion) to give anthracene (C14H10). Anthracene has 10 H but only 4 chemically distinct types (the H at positions 1/8, 2/7, 3/6, and 4/5 are each equivalent by symmetry).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
