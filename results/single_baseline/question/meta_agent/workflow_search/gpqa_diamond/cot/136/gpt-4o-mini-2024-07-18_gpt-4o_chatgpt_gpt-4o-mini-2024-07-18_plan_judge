Question: Example(question='A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at \\$t=0\\$ with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. \\$T\\simeq0\\$ undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy \\$T{1}=950MeV\\$. The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by\nU\\left(t\\right)=U{0}\\cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu\\left(\\alpha\\right)t+\\Phi_{0}\\right].\n\nHow many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?\nData : \\$\\Phi{0}=\\frac{\\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\\$. ', choice1='1864', choice2='2500', choice3='3536', choice4='5300', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to consider the energy gained per revolution and the total energy required. The proton is accelerated twice per revolution, gaining energy from the alternating voltage. The energy gained per acceleration is given by the voltage U0, which is 190 kV. Since the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution, the energy gained per revolution is 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. The total kinetic energy the proton needs to reach is 950 MeV. To find the number of revolutions, we divide the total energy by the energy gained per revolution: 950 MeV / 0.38 MeV = 2500 revolutions.
