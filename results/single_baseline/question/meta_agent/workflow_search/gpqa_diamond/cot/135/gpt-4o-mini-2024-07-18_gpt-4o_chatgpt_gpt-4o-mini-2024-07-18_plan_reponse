            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "The vector field f(r) is given as f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat, where r_hat is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a radial vector field A(r) = A(r) * r_hat in spherical coordinates is given by \u2207.A = (1/r^2) * d/dr (r^2 * A(r)). For f(r) = 1/r^2, we have A(r) = 1/r^2, so \u2207.f = (1/r^2) * d/dr (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * d/dr (1) = 0. Therefore, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere. The volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R is \u222b(\u2207.f) dV = \u222b0 dV = 0. Thus, the most appropriate answer is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
