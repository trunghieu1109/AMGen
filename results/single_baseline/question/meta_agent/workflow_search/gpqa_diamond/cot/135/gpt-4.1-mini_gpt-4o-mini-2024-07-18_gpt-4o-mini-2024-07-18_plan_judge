Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 in a sphere of radius R, we can use the divergence theorem. The divergence of a radial field of the form f(r) = 1/r^2 can be computed, and it is known that the divergence of a radial field in three dimensions is given by ∇·f = (1/r^2)(∂/∂r)(r^2 f(r)). For f(r) = 1/r^2, we find that ∇·f = 0 everywhere except at the origin. Therefore, the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere will yield the flux through the surface of the sphere. However, since the field falls off as 1/r^2, the net flux through the surface of the sphere will be zero, leading to the conclusion that the volume integral of the divergence is also zero. Thus, the most appropriate answer is 0.
