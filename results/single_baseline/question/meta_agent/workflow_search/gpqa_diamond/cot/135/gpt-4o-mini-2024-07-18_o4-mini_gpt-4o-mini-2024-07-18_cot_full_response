Question: {'question': 'A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', 'choice1': '1', 'choice2': '4 π', 'choice3': '0', 'choice4': '4/3 π R '}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pVxW', content='We have f(r)=r̂/r^2. Its divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin (a Dirac delta singularity). By the divergence theorem, ∫_V ∇·f dV = ∮_S f·dS. On a sphere of radius R, f·dS = (1/R^2)(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ, so the total flux is ∫_0^2π dφ ∫_0^π sinθ dθ = 4π. Thus the integral is 4π.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
