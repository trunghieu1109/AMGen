Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have f(r)=r̂/r^2. Its divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin (a Dirac delta singularity). By the divergence theorem, ∫_V ∇·f dV = ∮_S f·dS. On a sphere of radius R, f·dS = (1/R^2)(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ, so the total flux is ∫_0^2π dφ ∫_0^π sinθ dθ = 4π. Thus the integral is 4π.
