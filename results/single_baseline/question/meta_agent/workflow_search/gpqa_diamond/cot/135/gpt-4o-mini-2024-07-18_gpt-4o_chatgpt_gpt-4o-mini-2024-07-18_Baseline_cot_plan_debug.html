    <pre>The vector field f(r) is given as f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat, where r_hat is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a radial vector field A(r) = A(r) * r_hat in spherical coordinates is given by ∇.A = (1/r^2) * d/dr (r^2 * A(r)). For f(r) = 1/r^2, we have A(r) = 1/r^2, so ∇.f = (1/r^2) * d/dr (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * d/dr (1) = 0. Therefore, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere. The volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R is ∫(∇.f) dV = ∫0 dV = 0. Thus, the most appropriate answer is 0.
