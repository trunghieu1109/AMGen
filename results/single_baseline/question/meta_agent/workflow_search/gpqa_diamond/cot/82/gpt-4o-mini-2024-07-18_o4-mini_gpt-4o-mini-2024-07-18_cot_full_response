Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cT7v', content='We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: n₀ = 0.05 M×0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol. After adding 20.00 cm³ water, total V₀ = 0.04000 L, so [HA]₀ = 0.02500 M.\n\n1) 25% titration: 25% of HA neutralized → n\u2009OH⁻ = 0.25×0.00100 = 0.00025 mol, added volume = 0.00025 mol/0.1 M = 0.00250 L. Remaining HA = 0.00075 mol, A⁻ = 0.00025 mol, total V = 0.04000 + 0.00250 = 0.04250 L.\n   [HA] = 0.00075/0.04250 = 0.01765 M, [A⁻] = 0.00025/0.04250 = 0.005882 M.\n   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]) = 4.7324 + log(0.005882/0.01765) = 4.7324 + log(0.3333) = 4.7324 – 0.4771 = 4.255 ≈ 4.26.\n\n2) Equivalence point: all HA→ A⁻, n\u2009A⁻ = 0.00100 mol, volume of NaOH = 0.00100 mol/0.1 M = 0.01000 L. Total V = 0.04000 + 0.01000 = 0.05000 L → [A⁻] = 0.00100/0.05000 = 0.02000 M.\n   Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.00×10⁻¹⁴/1.85×10⁻⁵ = 5.405×10⁻¹⁰.   Solve x²/(0.02000–x) = 5.405×10⁻¹⁰ → x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁶ M → pOH = 5.483 → pH = 14 – 5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52.\n\nThese match choice 2: 4.26; 8.52.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
