        "response": "To find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point, we first need to determine the concentrations of acetic acid and NaOH at those points. At 25% titration, we have added 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH to the acetic acid solution. The equivalence point occurs when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. We can calculate the pH at both points using the dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid and the concentration of the resulting solution after dilution and titration.\n\nAnswer:choice1",
