Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid gives 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 moles = 0.00025 moles of NaOH are added, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate, and the concentration of acetate is 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa + log([A-])) = 8.52.
