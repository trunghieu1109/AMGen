    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star&#39;s surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.9&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~4.5&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~7.8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~1.1&#39;}

    <pre>We need the ratio n2/n1 at two temperatures in LTE: n2/n1 ∝ exp(-ΔE/kT). Thus the factor between T=6000K and T=5500K is exp[ΔE/k*(1/5500 - 1/6000)]. The transition wavelength is 1448Å, so ΔE = hc/λ ≈ 8.56 eV = 1.372×10^(-11) erg. With k = 1.381×10^(-16) erg/K, ΔE/k ≈ 9.94×10^4 K. Then (1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 1.515×10^(-5) K^(-1), giving exponent ≈ 1.505, so factor ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.5.
