            "Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.",

        "response": "Compound A shows a triplet (6H) and quartet (4H) \u21d2 two equivalent ethyl groups \u21d2 n\u2010butane. Monobromination gives mainly 2\u2010bromobutane (B). Elimination with alcoholic KOH gives but\u20102\u2010ene (C) cis/trans; the cis isomer undergoes a Diels\u2013Alder with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (a conjugated diene with an OH at C1). The cycloaddition of the diene (substituents \u2013OH at C1 and Me at C4) with cis-2-butene (two Me substituents) yields 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol with all substituents added syn (endo adduct). Assigning the endo configuration gives (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\nAnswer:A)",
