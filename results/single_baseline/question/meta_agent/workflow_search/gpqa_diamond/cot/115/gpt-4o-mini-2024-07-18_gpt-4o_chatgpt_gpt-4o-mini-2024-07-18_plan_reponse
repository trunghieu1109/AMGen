            "Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.",

        "response": "Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. This suggests A is an alkane with two equivalent methyl groups (triplet) and two equivalent methylene groups (quartet), likely a straight-chain alkane like butane. Monobromination of butane can give 1-bromobutane or 2-bromobutane. Reaction with alcoholic KOH suggests an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. 2-bromobutane would give but-2-ene, which has cis and trans isomers. The cis-isomer of but-2-ene reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, likely in a Diels-Alder reaction, to form a cyclohexene derivative. The stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction and the given choices suggest compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\nAnswer:A)",
