            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",

            "pre-replication complex",

        "response": "The question involves understanding which protein complexes are associated with active chromatin during the formation of the shmoo in yeast. The shmoo formation is related to mating and involves transcriptional activation, not DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, the enhancer protein complex is involved in transcription regulation, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not directly related to transcription or active chromatin in the context of shmoo formation. Therefore, the least observed proteins would be from the pre-replication complex.\n\nAnswer:B)",
