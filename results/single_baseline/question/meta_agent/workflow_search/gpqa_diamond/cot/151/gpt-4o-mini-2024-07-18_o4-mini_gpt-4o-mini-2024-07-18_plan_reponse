            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",
            "pre-initiation complex",
            "pre-replication complex",
            "enhancer protein complex",

        "response": "Active chromatin in a shmoo (representing transcriptionally active regions) will be enriched for transcription factors (pre-initiation complex), enhancer-associated proteins, and nucleosome histone complexes. Pre-replication complex proteins assemble at origins of replication during G1 and are not associated with active transcriptional chromatin, so they would be least recovered by ChIP-MS of active chromatin.\n\nAnswer:B)",
