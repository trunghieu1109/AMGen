            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",
            "pre-initiation complex",
            "pre-replication complex",
            "enhancer protein complex",

        "response": "In the context of studying the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the focus is on proteins that are involved in transcription and chromatin dynamics. The pre-initiation complex is directly involved in the initiation of transcription, while the enhancer protein complex is also related to transcriptional regulation. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not the primary focus here. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin but does not represent active transcription. Therefore, the least relevant complex in the context of active chromatin and transcription would be the pre-replication complex.\n\nAnswer:B",
