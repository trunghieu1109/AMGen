Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8A3n', content='We have four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Single-particle energy levels are E_n=n^2E with E=π^2ħ^2/(2mL^2), each level twofold spin-degenerate. For the ground state we fill n=1 and n=2 (each with two spins): E_gs=2·1^2E+2·2^2E=2E+8E=10E. The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3, giving occupations n=1(2),n=2(1),n=3(1): E_1st=2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=2E+4E+9E=15E. The second excited state is obtained by instead promoting one from n=1 to n=3 (with occupations n=1(1),n=2(2),n=3(1)): E_2nd=1·1^2E+2·2^2E+1·3^2E=1E+8E+9E=18E. Thus the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, corresponding to choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
