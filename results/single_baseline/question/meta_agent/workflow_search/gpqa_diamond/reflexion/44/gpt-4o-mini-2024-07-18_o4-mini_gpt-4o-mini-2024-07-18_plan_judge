Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Single-particle energy levels are E_n=n^2E with E=π^2ħ^2/(2mL^2), each level twofold spin-degenerate. For the ground state we fill n=1 and n=2 (each with two spins): E_gs=2·1^2E+2·2^2E=2E+8E=10E. The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3, giving occupations n=1(2),n=2(1),n=3(1): E_1st=2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=2E+4E+9E=15E. The second excited state is obtained by instead promoting one from n=1 to n=3 (with occupations n=1(1),n=2(2),n=3(1)): E_2nd=1·1^2E+2·2^2E+1·3^2E=1E+8E+9E=18E. Thus the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, corresponding to choice B).
