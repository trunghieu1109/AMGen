        "response": "We have four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well. Single-particle energy levels are E_n=n^2E with E=\u03c0^2\u0127^2/(2mL^2), each level twofold spin-degenerate. For the ground state we fill n=1 and n=2 (each with two spins): E_gs=2\u00b71^2E+2\u00b72^2E=2E+8E=10E. The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3, giving occupations n=1(2),n=2(1),n=3(1): E_1st=2\u00b71^2E+1\u00b72^2E+1\u00b73^2E=2E+4E+9E=15E. The second excited state is obtained by instead promoting one from n=1 to n=3 (with occupations n=1(1),n=2(2),n=3(1)): E_2nd=1\u00b71^2E+2\u00b72^2E+1\u00b73^2E=1E+8E+9E=18E. Thus the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, corresponding to choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
