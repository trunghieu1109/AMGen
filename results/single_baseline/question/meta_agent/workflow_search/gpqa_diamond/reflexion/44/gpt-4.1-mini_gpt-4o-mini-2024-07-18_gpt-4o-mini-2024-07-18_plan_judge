Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to apply the Pauli exclusion principle and the energy level formula for particles in a box. The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For four spin-1/2 particles, we can have all four particles in the lowest energy state (n=1) due to their spin, leading to a total ground state energy of 4E. The first excited state would have two particles in the ground state (n=1) and two in the first excited state (n=2), giving a total energy of 2E + 8E = 10E. The second excited state would involve different configurations, but typically it would be 15E based on the combinations of energy levels. Therefore, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 4E, 10E, and 15E respectively.

Answer:4E, 10E, 15E
Extracted answer: 4E, 10E, 15E
