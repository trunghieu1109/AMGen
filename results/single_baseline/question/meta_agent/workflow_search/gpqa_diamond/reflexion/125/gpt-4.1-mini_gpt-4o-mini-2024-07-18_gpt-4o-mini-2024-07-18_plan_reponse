            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "In Reaction I, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced by LAH to form a chiral alcohol, which will produce two peaks in chiral HPLC (one for each enantiomer). In Reaction II, pentane-2,4-dione is reduced by NaBH4 to form a diol, which is achiral and will produce one peak in both HPLC types. When combining the products, the chiral HPLC will show 2 peaks (from the chiral alcohol) and the normal-phase HPLC will show 2 peaks (one from the chiral alcohol and one from the achiral diol). Therefore, the total peaks observed are 2 in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase HPLC, which corresponds to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C",
