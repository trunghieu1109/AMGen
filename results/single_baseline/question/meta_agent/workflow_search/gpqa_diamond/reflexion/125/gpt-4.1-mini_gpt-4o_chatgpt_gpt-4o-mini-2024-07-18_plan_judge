Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Reaction I involves the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, which reduces the ketone to an alcohol, resulting in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Reaction II involves the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, which reduces both carbonyl groups to alcohols, resulting in 2,4-pentanediol. The 2,4-pentanediol can exist as a mixture of stereoisomers (meso and enantiomers). In normal-phase HPLC, the number of peaks corresponds to the number of different compounds, so we expect 2 peaks: one for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for 2,4-pentanediol. In chiral HPLC, the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give one peak, and the 2,4-pentanediol will give 3 peaks (one for the meso form and two for the enantiomers). Therefore, we expect 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.
