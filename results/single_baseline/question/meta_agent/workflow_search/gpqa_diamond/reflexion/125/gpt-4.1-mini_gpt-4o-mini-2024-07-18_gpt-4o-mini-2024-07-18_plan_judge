Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In Reaction I, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced by LAH to form a chiral alcohol, which will produce two peaks in chiral HPLC (one for each enantiomer). In Reaction II, pentane-2,4-dione is reduced by NaBH4 to form a diol, which is achiral and will produce one peak in both HPLC types. When combining the products, the chiral HPLC will show 2 peaks (from the chiral alcohol) and the normal-phase HPLC will show 2 peaks (one from the chiral alcohol and one from the achiral diol). Therefore, the total peaks observed are 2 in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase HPLC, which corresponds to choice 3.
