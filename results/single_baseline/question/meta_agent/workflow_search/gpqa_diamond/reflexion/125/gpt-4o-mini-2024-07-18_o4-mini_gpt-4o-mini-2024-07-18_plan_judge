Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, determine the stereochemical outcomes of each reaction:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is achiral at C3 but chiral at C5 (S configuration). LAH reduction of the C3 ketone generates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the existing C5 is fixed, the two possible alcohol products are diastereomers (S,C3-R and S,C3-S). Both diastereomers are formed and each is enantiomerically pure (no racemate), so you get 2 distinct chiral compounds.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is achiral and symmetric. NaBH4 reduces both ketones independently to give pentane-2,4-diol with two stereocenters. The statistical outcome is 1/4 R,R, 1/2 R,S (meso), and 1/4 S,S. There are three stereoisomers total: one meso (achiral) and an R,R/S,S enantiomeric pair.

Now, chromatographic behavior:
– On an achiral (normal-phase) HPLC column, diastereomers separate but enantiomers do not.  Reaction I gives 2 peaks (two diastereomers). Reaction II gives 2 peaks (one for meso, one for the coeluting R,R+S,S enantiomers). Total = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.
– On a chiral stationary-phase HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved. Reaction I still gives 2 peaks (each diastereomer is a single enantiomer). Reaction II gives 3 peaks (one for meso, plus separate R,R and S,S). Total = 2 + 3 = 5 peaks.

Thus the chemist observes 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.
