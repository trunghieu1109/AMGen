Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='We need to identify the incorrect statement. Statement 1 about −1 ribosomal frameshifting and similarity to SARS-CoV is correct. Statement 3 on ORF3a triggering caspase-8 via the extrinsic pathway is supported by studies. Statement 4 on pseudoknot conformations correlating with frameshifting rate is documented. Statement 2 says nsp14/nsp10 ExoN prevents breakdown of dsRNA, but in fact ExoN removes misincorporated nucleotides and can degrade dsRNA intermediates to evade immune detection, so the claim is reversed and thus incorrect.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
