        "response": "The SN1 substitution gives a secondary alcohol at C-5, which PDC oxidizes to a ketone. A Wittig with H2C=PPh3 installs an exocyclic methylene, and treatment with TsOH simply isomerizes that exo-methylene into the ring, yielding the original bicyclic skeleton with one internal double bond and the two original methyls. That matches the octahydro product in choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
