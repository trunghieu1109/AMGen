        "response": "The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a peak at m/z = 158, suggesting the presence of a chlorine atom due to the characteristic isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm (2H each) suggest an aromatic ring with substitution. Considering these data, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits well as it has a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and an aromatic ring.\n\nAnswer:A)",
