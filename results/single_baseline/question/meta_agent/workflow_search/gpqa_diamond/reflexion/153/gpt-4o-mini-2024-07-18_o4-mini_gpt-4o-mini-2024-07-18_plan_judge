Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band plus a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O, indicating a carboxylic acid; the 11.0 ppm singlet is the COOH proton; the 8.02 and 7.72 ppm doublets (2H each) indicate a para-substituted benzene; the mass of 156 with M+2 at 158 (32%) matches one Cl atom. This points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
