        "response": "The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol, which could correspond to several compounds. The peak at m/z = 158 indicates the presence of chlorine due to its isotopes. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicating an -OH group, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (indicative of a carboxylic acid), and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm (indicative of aromatic protons). Given the molecular weight and the spectral data, both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid are possible candidates. However, the presence of the singlet at 11.0 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, and the substitution pattern of the chlorine needs to be considered. 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits the molecular weight and the spectral data well, making it a strong candidate. Therefore, I will choose 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the best fit.\n\nAnswer:A",
