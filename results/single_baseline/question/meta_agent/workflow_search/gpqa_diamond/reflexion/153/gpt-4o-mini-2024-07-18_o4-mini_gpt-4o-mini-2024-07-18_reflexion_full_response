Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MzXe', content='The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band plus a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O, indicating a carboxylic acid; the 11.0 ppm singlet is the COOH proton; the 8.02 and 7.72 ppm doublets (2H each) indicate a para-substituted benzene; the mass of 156 with M+2 at 158 (32%) matches one Cl atom. This points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
