Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have a diatomic molecule X–Y in its ground rovibrational state v=0, j=0. In IR absorption (rotation–vibration spectroscopy), the allowed fundamental transition is v:0→1 with Δj=+1 (R branch). The transition energy is
E = ħ·ω + [E_j=1 – E_j=0] = ħω + (ħ^2/I)·2 ,
where I = μ·R^2 and μ = (MxMy)/(Mx+My) in kg. Compute:
Mx = 20 amu = 20×1.66e–27 kg = 3.32e–26 kg
My = 2 amu = 3.32e–27 kg
μ = (3.32e–26×3.32e–27)/(3.32e–26+3.32e–27) ≈ 3.02e–27 kg
R = 2 Å = 2e–10 m ⇒ I = 3.02e–27×(2e–10)^2 = 1.21e–46 kg·m^2
ħω = 1.055e–34×4e14 = 4.22e–20 J
(ħ^2/I)·2 = 2×(1.055e–34)^2/1.21e–46 ≈ 1.84e–22 J
E ≈ 4.22e–20 + 1.84e–22 = 4.24e–20 J
Photon momentum p = E/c ≈ 4.24e–20 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.41e–28 kg·m/s
Thus the closest choice is p = 1.4×10^–28 N·s, choice D).
