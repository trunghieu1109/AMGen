Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 0UjO', content='We have a diatomic molecule X–Y in its ground rovibrational state v=0, j=0. In IR absorption (rotation–vibration spectroscopy), the allowed fundamental transition is v:0→1 with Δj=+1 (R branch). The transition energy is\nE = ħ·ω + [E_j=1 – E_j=0] = ħω + (ħ^2/I)·2 ,\nwhere I = μ·R^2 and μ = (MxMy)/(Mx+My) in kg.
