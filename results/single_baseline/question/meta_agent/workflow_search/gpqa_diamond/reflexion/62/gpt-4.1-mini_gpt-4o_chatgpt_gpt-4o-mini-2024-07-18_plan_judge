Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to determine the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule. The molecule can be modeled as a non-rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = J(J+1)ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω. The molecule is initially in the ground state (J=0, v=0) and transitions to the first excited state. The moment of inertia I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass μ = (Mx*My)/(Mx+My). Calculate μ, then I, and find the energy difference ΔE = E_rot + E_vib. The momentum of the photon is p = ΔE/c.
