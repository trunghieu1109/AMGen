        "response": "To find the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next energy state, we need to calculate the energy of the photon using the formula E = h * w, where h is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^(-34) J*s) and w is the angular frequency (4 x 10^14 rad/s). The momentum of the photon can then be calculated using the relation p = E/c, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). First, we calculate the energy of the photon, then we can find the momentum. Let's perform the calculations step by step.\n\nAnswer:p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s",
