        "response": "To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to determine the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule. The molecule can be modeled as a non-rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = J(J+1)\u0127\u00b2/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (v + 1/2)\u0127\u03c9. The molecule is initially in the ground state (J=0, v=0) and transitions to the first excited state. The moment of inertia I = \u03bcR\u00b2, where \u03bc is the reduced mass \u03bc = (Mx*My)/(Mx+My). Calculate \u03bc, then I, and find the energy difference \u0394E = E_rot + E_vib. The momentum of the photon is p = \u0394E/c.\n\nAnswer:C)",
