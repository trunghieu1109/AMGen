Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next energy state, we need to calculate the energy of the photon using the formula E = h * w, where h is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^(-34) J*s) and w is the angular frequency (4 x 10^14 rad/s). The momentum of the photon can then be calculated using the relation p = E/c, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). First, we calculate the energy of the photon, then we can find the momentum. Let's perform the calculations step by step.

Answer:p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s
Extracted answer: p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s
Correct answer: 4
