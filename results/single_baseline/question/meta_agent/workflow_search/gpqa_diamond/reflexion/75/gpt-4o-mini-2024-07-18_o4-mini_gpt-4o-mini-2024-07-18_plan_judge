Question: Example(question='You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?', choice1='green signal colocalizes with the red signal', choice2='there is no green signal', choice3='cell line-specific red signals label different organelles', choice4='cytoplasmic localization of the red signal', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The mRaspberry reporter under a lineage‐specific promoter will simply fluoresce in the cytoplasm of the injected iPSCs at early timepoints. TUNEL‐FITC detects DNA strand breaks in apoptotic nuclei, which aren’t present immediately after injection, so you won’t see green. You therefore first observe the red fluorescence localized throughout the cytoplasm of the labeled cells.
