        "response": "To find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point, we need to calculate the concentrations of acetic acid and NaOH at those points. At 25% titration, we have 25% of the acetic acid neutralized, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. At the equivalence point, we will have a solution of sodium acetate, and we can calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of acetate ions. After performing the calculations, we can compare the results with the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:choice1",
