        "response": "First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid gives 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 water, the total volume is 40.00 cm3, but the moles remain the same. For 25% titration, 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH at 25% titration: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles in 40.00 cm3, or 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa + log([A-])) = 8.52.\n\nAnswer:B",
