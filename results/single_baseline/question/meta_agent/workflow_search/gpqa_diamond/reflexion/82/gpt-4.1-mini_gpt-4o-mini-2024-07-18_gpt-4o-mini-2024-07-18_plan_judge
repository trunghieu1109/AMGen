Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point, we need to calculate the concentrations of acetic acid and NaOH at those points. At 25% titration, we have 25% of the acetic acid neutralized, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. At the equivalence point, we will have a solution of sodium acetate, and we can calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of acetate ions. After performing the calculations, we can compare the results with the provided choices.
