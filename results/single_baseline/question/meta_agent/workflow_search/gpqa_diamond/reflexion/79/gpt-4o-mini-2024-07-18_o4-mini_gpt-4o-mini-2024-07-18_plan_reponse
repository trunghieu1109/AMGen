Thus wA=115\u22122wG and wC=61\u22122wT. For ACAGTGACC (#A=3,#C=3,#G=2,#T=1) we get f=3wA+3wC+2wG+wT=528\u22124wG\u22125wT. Testing the four choices: 333,315,351,185, we look for nonnegative integer solutions (wA,wC,wG,wT). 185 fails completely (no solution). 333,315,351 all admit solutions, so more constraints are needed. If we impose that G (having three H-bonds) > C (two H-bonds), we require wG>wC i.e. wG >61\u22122wT. The only choice that admits integer wG,wT with wG >wC is 315 (e.g. wT=1,wG=52 gives wA=11,wC=59). Thus the most biologically plausible answer is 315.\n\nAnswer:B",
