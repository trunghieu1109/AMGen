Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the output for 'ACAGTGACC', we need to analyze the outputs for the given inputs 'AGG' and 'TGCTGA'. The outputs are 115 and 176 respectively. We can look for a pattern or a rule that relates the input strings to their outputs. One possible approach is to consider the lengths of the strings or the sum of ASCII values of the characters. However, without a clear formula or pattern from the examples, we can only make an educated guess based on the provided choices. The choices are 333, 315, 351, and 185. Since we have no definitive method to calculate the output, we will select one of the choices based on intuition or estimation, but we should also consider the nature of the inputs and outputs given.
