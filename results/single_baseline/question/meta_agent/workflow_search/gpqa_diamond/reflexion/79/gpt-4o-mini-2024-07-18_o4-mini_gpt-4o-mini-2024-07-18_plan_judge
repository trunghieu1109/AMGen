Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We assume a simple linear model f(seq)=wA·#A + wC·#C + wG·#G + wT·#T. From AGG→115 we get wA +2wG=115; from TGCTGA→176 we get wA +wC +2wG +2wT=176. Thus wA=115−2wG and wC=61−2wT. For ACAGTGACC (#A=3,#C=3,#G=2,#T=1) we get f=3wA+3wC+2wG+wT=528−4wG−5wT. Testing the four choices: 333,315,351,185, we look for nonnegative integer solutions (wA,wC,wG,wT). 185 fails completely (no solution). 333,315,351 all admit solutions, so more constraints are needed. If we impose that G (having three H-bonds) > C (two H-bonds), we require wG>wC i.e. wG >61−2wT. The only choice that admits integer wG,wT with wG >wC is 315 (e.g. wT=1,wG=52 gives wA=11,wC=59). Thus the most biologically plausible answer is 315.
