            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star spots and equate it to the amplitude caused by a transiting exoplanet. The star has a temperature of 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so they are at 5000K. The filling factor of the spots is 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The brightness of a blackbody is proportional to T^4, so the brightness ratio of the spots to the unspotted surface is (5000/6000)^4. The effective brightness of the spotted hemisphere is 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4). The amplitude of the variation is the difference between the spotted and unspotted brightness. For a transiting planet, the amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Equating these gives us the radius ratio.\n\nAnswer:C)",
