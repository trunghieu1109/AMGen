### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent p40I (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X and its constituent elements. Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. A common reagent that fits this description is deuterated water (D2O), where deuterium (D) is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. When D2O reacts with a liquid Y, it releases a gas W with equal numbers of neutrons and protons, which suggests that W could be D2 (deuterium gas), as deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The precipitate G that forms and releases B upon heating could be a compound like calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which releases CO2 (B) upon heating. The melting point of CO2 is close to 277 K. The reaction of a keto acid with D2O could produce a compound with 2 oxygen atoms, such as a deuterated keto acid. The lightest element in D2O is deuterium (D), and the heaviest is oxygen (O). The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16. Since D2O contains two deuterium atoms, we sum the masses: 2 (for D) + 2 (for D) + 16 (for O) = 20. However, the problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all isotopes. Since deuterium is the only isotope of hydrogen considered here, and oxygen is the heaviest element, the cumulative atomic mass is 2 (for D) + 16 (for O) = 18. But this does not match any of the choices. Re-evaluating, if we consider the possibility of a different substance X, such as a compound containing carbon (C) and oxygen (O), the lightest element could be carbon (12) and the heaviest could be oxygen (16). The cumulative atomic mass would then be 12 + 16 = 28, which is close to 29. Therefore, the closest choice is 29.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent mciB:
The reasoning provided in the solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the final calculation. The problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, considering all isotopes. The solution correctly identifies deuterium (D) as the lightest element and oxygen (O) as the heaviest element in D2O. The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16. Since D2O contains two deuterium atoms, the cumulative atomic mass should be calculated as 2 (for D) + 2 (for D) + 16 (for O) = 20. However, the solution incorrectly concludes that the cumulative atomic mass is 18. The correct cumulative atomic mass is 20, which does not match any of the given choices. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

    <pre>Substance X is likely deuterated water (D2O), where deuterium (D) is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. The lightest element in D2O is deuterium, and the heaviest is oxygen. The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16. Since D2O contains two deuterium atoms, the cumulative atomic mass is 2 (for D) + 2 (for D) + 16 (for O) = 20. However, this does not match any of the choices. Re-evaluating, if we consider a different interpretation, such as a compound containing carbon (C) and oxygen (O), the lightest element could be carbon (12) and the heaviest could be oxygen (16). The cumulative atomic mass would then be 12 + 16 = 28, which is close to 29. Therefore, the closest choice is 29.
