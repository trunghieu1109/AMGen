    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;29&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;25&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;35&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;31&#39;}

    <pre>Substance X is the deuteride analog of lithium aluminum hydride, i.e. LiAlD4, used in organic reductions. It incorporates the heavier isotope deuterium. Step 1: Reaction with water (liquid Y) yields D2 gas (each D atom has one proton and one neutron) and precipitate Al(OH)3. Step 2: Heating Al(OH)3 releases water (B), whose melting point (~273–277 K) matches the clue. Step 3: X’s formula LiAlD4 contains Li, Al, and four D isotopes. The lightest element is deuterium (atomic mass ≈2) present 4 times → cumulative mass ≈4×2=8. The heaviest is Al (≈27). Sum = 8+27 = 35, matching choice3.
