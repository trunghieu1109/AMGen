Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Substance X is likely deuterated water (D2O), where deuterium (D) is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. The lightest element in D2O is deuterium, and the heaviest is oxygen. The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16. Since D2O contains two deuterium atoms, the cumulative atomic mass is 2 (for D) + 2 (for D) + 16 (for O) = 20. However, this does not match any of the choices. Re-evaluating, if we consider a different interpretation, such as a compound containing carbon (C) and oxygen (O), the lightest element could be carbon (12) and the heaviest could be oxygen (16). The cumulative atomic mass would then be 12 + 16 = 28, which is close to 29. Therefore, the closest choice is 29.
