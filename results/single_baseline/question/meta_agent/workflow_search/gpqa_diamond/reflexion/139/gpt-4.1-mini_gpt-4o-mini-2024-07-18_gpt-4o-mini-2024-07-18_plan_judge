Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, we need to identify the elements based on the clues provided. The lightest element is likely hydrogen (H) with an atomic mass of approximately 1, and the heaviest element could be chlorine (Cl) with an atomic mass of about 35. Summing these gives us 1 + 35 = 36. However, since 36 is not one of the provided choices, we need to consider the heaviest element alone, which is chlorine (Cl) with an atomic mass of 35. Therefore, the answer should reflect the closest choice available, which is 35.
