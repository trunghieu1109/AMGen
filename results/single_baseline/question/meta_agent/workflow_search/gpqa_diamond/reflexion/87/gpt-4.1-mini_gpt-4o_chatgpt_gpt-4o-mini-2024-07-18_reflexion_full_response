Question: {'question': 'You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Np2M', content="The question describes a scenario where inner capsid proteins of rotavirus tagged with GFP are delivered to mice. The fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The proliferating cell population in these patches shows high variability in their variable heavy chain gene sequences. This high variability is indicative of a process that introduces mutations to increase antibody diversity. Somatic hypermutation is the process that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in B cells, leading to increased diversity and affinity maturation. Complement activation and class switching recombination do not directly cause high variability in the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs earlier in B cell development and is responsible for initial diversity, but the question suggests ongoing variability, which is characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
