Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes B cell proliferation in Peyer patches, sequencing of their variable heavy chain genes showing high variability. This variability in the variable region after antigen exposure is characteristic of somatic hypermutation occurring in germinal centers to improve antibody affinity. VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development pre-antigen encounter; class switching changes the constant region; complement activation is not relevant to gene variability. Thus the process is somatic hypermutation.
