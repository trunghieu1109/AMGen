Question: {'question': 'You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', 'choice1': 'somatic hypermutation', 'choice2': 'complement activation', 'choice3': 'class switching recombination', 'choice4': 'VDJ recombination'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent M6D3', content='In the scenario described, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after isolating the proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches suggests that the B cells are undergoing a process that increases the diversity of their antibodies. This is characteristic of somatic hypermutation, which occurs after B cells have been activated and are proliferating in response to an antigen. The other processes listed (complement activation, class switching recombination, and VDJ recombination) do not specifically account for the high variability observed in the variable region of the heavy chain gene. Therefore, the correct answer is somatic hypermutation.\n\nAnswer:A', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
