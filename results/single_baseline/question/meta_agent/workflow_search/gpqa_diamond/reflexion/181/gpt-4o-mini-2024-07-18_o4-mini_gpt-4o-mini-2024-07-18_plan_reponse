            "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n",
            "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.",
            "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.",
            "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.",

        "response": "The Mott\u2013Gurney law requires trap-free, single-carrier transport with ideal (Ohmic) injection\u2014i.e. no injection barrier\u2014and negligible diffusion, since the current is space-charge limited (drift-dominated). Choice 1 matches these conditions.\n\nAnswer:A)",
