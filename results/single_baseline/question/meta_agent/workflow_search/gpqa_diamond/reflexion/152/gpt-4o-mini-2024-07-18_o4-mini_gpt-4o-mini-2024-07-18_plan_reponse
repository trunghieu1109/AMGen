            "\u03b1-\u03b2 unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

            "A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

        "response": "For A: malonate enolate adds to methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate giving a trimethyl propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate with p-tolyl at C2, matching \u201ctrimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\u201d For B: the enamine from cyclohexanone (1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine) adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile and on hydrolysis gives 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione adds to but-3-en-2-one under base to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Only choice 4 has all three correct.\n\nAnswer:D)",
