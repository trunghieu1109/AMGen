            "\u03b1-\u03b2 unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

        "response": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the products of the given Michael addition reactions. In a Michael addition, a nucleophile adds to the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. \n\nFor reaction (A), dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the beta position of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH, leading to the formation of trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\nFor reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as the nucleophile and attacks the beta position of (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+, leading to the formation of 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n\nFor reaction (C), cyclohexane-1,3-dione acts as the nucleophile and attacks the beta position of but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O, leading to the formation of 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nNow, we match these products with the given choices.\n\nAnswer:A)",
