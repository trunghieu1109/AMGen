        "response": "To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the conservation of energy. The total energy E of the system is given by E = \\gamma mc^2 + U, where \\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor and U is the potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator, U = (1/2)kx^2. At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. The total energy is conserved, so we equate the total energy at maximum amplitude and maximum speed. At maximum amplitude, E = mc^2/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2) + (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, E = mc^2/\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2). Solving for v_{max}, we find v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-(1/(1+kA^2/(2mc^2)))}.\n\nAnswer:B)",
