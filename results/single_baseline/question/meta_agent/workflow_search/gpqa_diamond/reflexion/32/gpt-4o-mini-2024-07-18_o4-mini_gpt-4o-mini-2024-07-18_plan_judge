Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction is a Dielsâ€“Alder between 2,5-dimethylthiophene (diene) and maleic anhydride. The exo adduct places the anhydride bridge oxygen anti to the methyl substituents, giving opposite configurations at C4 and C7 (one R, one S). Only choice 3 has 4R,7S with the epoxy (O-bridge) correctly named.
