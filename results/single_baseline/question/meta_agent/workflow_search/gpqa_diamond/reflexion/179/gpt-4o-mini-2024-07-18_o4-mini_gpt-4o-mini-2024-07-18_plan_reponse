        "response": "We need the total Coulomb energy of 13 charges: one at the center and 12 arranged to minimize repulsion on a sphere of radius R=2\u2009m (the Thomson problem). Each charge is q=2e=3.204\u00d710^-19\u2009C. \n\nCenter\u2013peripheral contribution: 12 pairs at distance 2\u2009m gives U_cp = 12 k q^2 / 2 = 6 k q^2.\nPeripheral\u2013peripheral contribution: The minimum for N=12 on a unit sphere has dimensionless energy E12 \u2243 44.758, giving U_pp = k q^2 (E12 / R) = k q^2 (44.758 / 2) = 22.379 k q^2.  \nTotal U = k q^2 (6 + 22.379) = 28.379 k q^2 \u2243 28.379 \u00d7 (8.988\u00d710^9\u2009\u00d7\u2009(3.204\u00d710^-19)^2) \u2243 2.62\u00d710^-26\u2009J.  \n\nAmong the choices, 2.822\u00d710^-26\u2009J (choice A) is the only one of the correct order of magnitude.\n\nAnswer:A)",
