Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are at a distance of 2 m from P. Each charge is 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). The potential energy between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2). In this system, the 13th charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 m. The potential energy for each pair is U_pair = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2. There are 12 such pairs, so the total potential energy is U_total = 12 * U_pair. Substituting the values, we get U_total = 12 * (8.988 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. Calculating this gives the total energy.
