Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the interactions between the charges. The potential energy U between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²). In this case, we have 12 charges of 2e each at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P. The total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges with respect to the charge at P. Since all charges are identical and at the same distance, we can calculate the energy for one pair and then multiply by 12. The charge of an electron is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C, so 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C. Therefore, the potential energy for one charge at distance 2 m is U = k * (2e * 2e) / 2 = (8.99 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. We calculate this value and then multiply by 12 to get the total energy. After performing the calculations, we find the total energy and compare it with the provided choices to find the correct answer.
