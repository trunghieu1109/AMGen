Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the total Coulomb energy of 13 charges: one at the center and 12 arranged to minimize repulsion on a sphere of radius R=2 m (the Thomson problem). Each charge is q=2e=3.204×10^-19 C. 

Center–peripheral contribution: 12 pairs at distance 2 m gives U_cp = 12 k q^2 / 2 = 6 k q^2.
Peripheral–peripheral contribution: The minimum for N=12 on a unit sphere has dimensionless energy E12 ≃ 44.758, giving U_pp = k q^2 (E12 / R) = k q^2 (44.758 / 2) = 22.379 k q^2.  
Total U = k q^2 (6 + 22.379) = 28.379 k q^2 ≃ 28.379 × (8.988×10^9 × (3.204×10^-19)^2) ≃ 2.62×10^-26 J.  

Among the choices, 2.822×10^-26 J (choice A) is the only one of the correct order of magnitude.
