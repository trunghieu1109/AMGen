        "response": "The Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically leads to a product with a different connectivity while maintaining the overall structure. The starting material is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, which will rearrange to form a new bicyclic compound. Analyzing the provided choices, I need to identify which one corresponds to the expected product of this rearrangement.\n\nAnswer:4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine",
