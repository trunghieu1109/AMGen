        "response": "The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and a reagent A. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires acidic conditions to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, A should be an acid like H3O+. The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using water and a reagent B. This is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which also requires acidic conditions. Therefore, B should be an acid like HCl. Thus, the suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\nAnswer:D)",
