Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hj0Z', content='The reaction of a ketone with NaCN to form a cyanohydrin requires acid to generate HCN, so A must be H₃O⁺. The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strong acid (HCl), not weak acetic acid. Thus A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl corresponds to choice 4, i.e. D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
