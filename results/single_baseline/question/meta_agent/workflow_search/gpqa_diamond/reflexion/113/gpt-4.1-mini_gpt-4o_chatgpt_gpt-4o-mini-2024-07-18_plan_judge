Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and a reagent A. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires acidic conditions to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, A should be an acid like H3O+. The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using water and a reagent B. This is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which also requires acidic conditions. Therefore, B should be an acid like HCl. Thus, the suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl.
