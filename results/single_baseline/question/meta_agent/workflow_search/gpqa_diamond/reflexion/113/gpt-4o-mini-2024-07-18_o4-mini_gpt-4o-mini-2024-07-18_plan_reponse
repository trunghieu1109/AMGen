        "response": "The reaction of a ketone with NaCN to form a cyanohydrin requires acid to generate HCN, so A must be H\u2083O\u207a. The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strong acid (HCl), not weak acetic acid. Thus A = H\u2083O\u207a and B = HCl corresponds to choice 4, i.e. D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
