Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction of a ketone with NaCN to form a cyanohydrin requires acid to generate HCN, so A must be H₃O⁺. The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strong acid (HCl), not weak acetic acid. Thus A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl corresponds to choice 4, i.e. D).
