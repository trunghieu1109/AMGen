Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Step 1: Toluene with HNO3/H2SO4 gives nitrotoluene, favoring the para isomer (1 = p-nitrotoluene).
Step 2: MnO2 oxidizes the benzylic methyl to an aldehyde, giving 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (2).
Step 3: Aldol condensation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone under NaOH yields 4-nitrobenzalacetone (3), a planar α,β-unsaturated ketone.
Symmetry analysis of 3: it's planar, so has a single mirror plane (the molecular plane), but no C2 axis or inversion center. Its only symmetry element (besides identity) is that one σ plane → point group cs.
