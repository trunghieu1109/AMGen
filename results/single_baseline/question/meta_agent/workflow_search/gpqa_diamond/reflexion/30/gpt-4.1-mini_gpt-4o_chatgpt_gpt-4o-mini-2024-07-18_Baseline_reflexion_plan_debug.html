    <pre>First, toluene is nitrated using nitric acid and sulfuric acid, which typically results in the formation of nitrotoluene, specifically para-nitrotoluene due to the directing effects of the methyl group. Next, the nitrotoluene is oxidized using MnO2 and H2SO4, which would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, forming para-nitrobenzoic acid. Finally, the para-nitrobenzoic acid is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, which suggests an aldol condensation reaction. However, since para-nitrobenzoic acid does not have an alpha hydrogen, it cannot undergo aldol condensation directly. Instead, the reaction might involve the formation of a salt or some other interaction. The symmetry of the final product, considering the para substitution and potential interactions, is likely to be Cs, which is a common symmetry for such substituted benzenes.
