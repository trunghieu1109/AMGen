        "response": "Step 1: Toluene with HNO3/H2SO4 gives nitrotoluene, favoring the para isomer (1 = p-nitrotoluene).\nStep 2: MnO2 oxidizes the benzylic methyl to an aldehyde, giving 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (2).\nStep 3: Aldol condensation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone under NaOH yields 4-nitrobenzalacetone (3), a planar \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone.\nSymmetry analysis of 3: it's planar, so has a single mirror plane (the molecular plane), but no C2 axis or inversion center. Its only symmetry element (besides identity) is that one \u03c3 plane \u2192 point group cs.\n\nAnswer:A)",
