            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",

            "stronger \u2013 slower",

        "response": "The standard potentials are E\u00b0(O\u2082/H\u2082O) = 1.229 V in acid and E\u00b0(O\u2082/HO\u2013) = 0.401 V in base, so O\u2082 is a weaker oxidant in basic solution. Kinetically the O\u2082 reduction reaction in acidic media is sluggish (requires high overpotential), i.e. slow.\n\nAnswer:C",
