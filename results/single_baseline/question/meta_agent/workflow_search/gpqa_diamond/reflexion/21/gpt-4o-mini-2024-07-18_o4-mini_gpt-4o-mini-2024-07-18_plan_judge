Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The standard potentials are E°(O₂/H₂O) = 1.229 V in acid and E°(O₂/HO–) = 0.401 V in base, so O₂ is a weaker oxidant in basic solution. Kinetically the O₂ reduction reaction in acidic media is sluggish (requires high overpotential), i.e. slow.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
