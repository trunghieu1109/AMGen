Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In electrochemistry, oxygen is generally considered a stronger oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions due to the stability of the species formed. Kinetically, reactions involving oxygen tend to occur faster in acidic solutions because the acidic environment can facilitate the reaction mechanisms. Therefore, the correct combination is 'stronger – faster'.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 3
