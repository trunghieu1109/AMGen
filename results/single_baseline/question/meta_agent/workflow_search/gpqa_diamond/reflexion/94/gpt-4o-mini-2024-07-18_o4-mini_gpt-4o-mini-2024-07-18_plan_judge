Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The starting enone has two isolated C=C bonds (at C1–C2 and C5–C6) that undergo epoxidation to give two epoxides (50:50). Treatment with MeLi/CuI (a Gilman reagent) opens an epoxide, installing a Me and converting the epoxide oxygen into an OH, while the other C=C remains untouched. That gives a ketone at C4, one remaining alkene, one new OH, and a new Me. Of the given choices, only C corresponds to one alkene, one ketone, one OH and the correct count of methyl groups (attack on the internal epoxide leads to OH at C5 and two Me at C6 in their numbering).
