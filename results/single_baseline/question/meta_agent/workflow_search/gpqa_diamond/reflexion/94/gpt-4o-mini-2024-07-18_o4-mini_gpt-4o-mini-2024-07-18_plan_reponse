        "response": "The starting enone has two isolated C=C bonds (at C1\u2013C2 and C5\u2013C6) that undergo epoxidation to give two epoxides (50:50). Treatment with MeLi/CuI (a Gilman reagent) opens an epoxide, installing a Me and converting the epoxide oxygen into an OH, while the other C=C remains untouched. That gives a ketone at C4, one remaining alkene, one new OH, and a new Me. Of the given choices, only C corresponds to one alkene, one ketone, one OH and the correct count of methyl groups (attack on the internal epoxide leads to OH at C5 and two Me at C6 in their numbering).\n\nAnswer:C)",
