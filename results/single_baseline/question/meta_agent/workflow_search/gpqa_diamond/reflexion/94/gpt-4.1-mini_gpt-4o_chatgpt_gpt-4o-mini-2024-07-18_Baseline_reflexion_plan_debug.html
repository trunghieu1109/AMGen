    <pre>The compound 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one has a ketone group and two double bonds. When treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), an epoxidation reaction occurs. The mCPBA will react with one of the double bonds to form an epoxide. Since there are two double bonds, two different epoxides can be formed, leading to two different products in a 1:1 ratio. In the second step, methyllithium is treated with copper(I) iodide to form a Gilman reagent (a lithium diorganocopper compound). This reagent can perform conjugate addition (1,4-addition) to the enone system. The epoxide can also be opened by the organocuprate. Considering the possible transformations, the most likely product is the one where the organocuprate adds to the enone and the epoxide is opened, leading to a diol. The product that matches this description is 4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol.
