        "response": "To determine the valid structure of product 4, I need to carefully analyze the reaction sequence and the stereochemistry involved in each transformation. The starting material undergoes hydrogenation, which will affect the double bond, followed by epoxidation, which introduces an epoxide group. The subsequent treatment with sodium methoxide will lead to a ring-opening reaction, and finally, the esterification with propanoic acid and DCC will yield the final product. I will consider the stereochemistry and functional groups in each step to identify the correct structure among the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:choice2",
