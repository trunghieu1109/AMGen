    <pre>We start from (R)-(+)-limonene (1-methyl-4-isopropenylcyclohex-1-ene).  Hydrogenation with Pd/C consumes 1 equiv Hâ‚‚, reducing the exocyclic double bond to give 4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexene (product 1).  Epoxidation of the remaining internal alkene with mCPBA yields the 1,2-epoxide (product 2).  Methoxide ring-opens the epoxide at C2, giving a trans 1-hydroxy-2-methoxy substituent pattern (product 3).  Esterification of the C1 OH with propionic acid/DCC/DMAP yields a cyclohexyl propionate with trans OMe and OCOPr at C2 and C1, respectively (product 4).  Trans substitution on adjacent carbons corresponds to opposite absolute configurations at C1 and C2.  The retained chiral center at C4 remains R.  The only choice with 1S,2R,4R is choice 4.
