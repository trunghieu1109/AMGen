Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, we need to consider the structure of product 3 after ozonolysis and the reaction with dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, leading to carbonyl compounds, which can affect the NMR spectrum. The splitting pattern in NMR is influenced by the number of neighboring hydrogen atoms. Given the options, I will analyze the possible coupling patterns based on typical organic chemistry principles.

Answer:doublet of triplets
Extracted answer: doublet of triplets
Correct answer: 2
