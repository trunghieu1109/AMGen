            "1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?",

        "response": "The reaction sequence involves 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH to form a ketone, as indicated by the IR spectrum. The subsequent reaction with aluminum isopropoxide might involve reduction or rearrangement, but the key transformation is ozonolysis, which typically cleaves double bonds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely near an electronegative group or a carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens. A triplet of triplets suggests coupling with three sets of non-equivalent hydrogens, which is plausible given the complexity of the transformations.\n\nAnswer:B)",
