The most downfield proton is on the methine carbon flanked by two carbonyls. It is coupled to two sets of two equivalent methylene protons on either side. Since the two vicinal coupling constants are different, this proton will appear as a triplet of triplets rather than a simple quintet or doublet of triplets.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Qcor (yourself):\nB)\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent koo2:\nThe downfield methine proton is flanked by four magnetically equivalent protons and thus couples with essentially one J‚Äêvalue, giving a simple quintet (n+1=5) rather than a triplet of triplets.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better."}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
