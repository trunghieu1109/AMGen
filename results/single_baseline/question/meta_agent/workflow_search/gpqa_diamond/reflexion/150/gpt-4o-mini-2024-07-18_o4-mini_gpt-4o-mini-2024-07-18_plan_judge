Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, find the eigenvalues of P by solving det(P−λI)=0. The characteristic equation yields eigenvalues λ=1,0,−1. The projector onto eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector v₀ satisfying Pv₀=0: this gives v₀∝(1,0,−1). Normalizing v₀ gives φ₀=(1/√2,0,−1/√2). The state ψ=(-1,2,1) has norm √6, so the normalized state is ψ/√6. The probability of measuring 0 is |⟨φ₀|ψ/√6⟩|² = |(1/√2)(−1/√6)+(−1/√2)(1/√6)|² = (−1/√3)² = 1/3.
