An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0).

        "response": "First, find the eigenvalues of P by solving det(P\u2212\u03bbI)=0. The characteristic equation yields eigenvalues \u03bb=1,0,\u22121. The projector onto eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector v\u2080 satisfying Pv\u2080=0: this gives v\u2080\u221d(1,0,\u22121). Normalizing v\u2080 gives \u03c6\u2080=(1/\u221a2,0,\u22121/\u221a2). The state \u03c8=(-1,2,1) has norm \u221a6, so the normalized state is \u03c8/\u221a6. The probability of measuring 0 is |\u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8/\u221a6\u27e9|\u00b2 = |(1/\u221a2)(\u22121/\u221a6)+(\u22121/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6)|\u00b2 = (\u22121/\u221a3)\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nAnswer:A",
