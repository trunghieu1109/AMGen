Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent WFZD', content='To determine the mass dimension of \\kappa in the given Lagrangian, we need to analyze the dimensions of the other components in the interaction term. The fermionic field \\psi has a mass dimension of \\frac{3}{2} in 4 dimensions. The field strength tensor F^{\\mu\\nu} has a mass dimension of 2. The term \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} must have a total mass dimension of 4, as it is part of the Lagrangian density. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\left[\\bar{\\psi}\\right] + \\left[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\right] + \\left[\\psi\\right] + \\left[F^{\\mu\\nu}\\right] + \\left[\\kappa\\right] = 4. Since \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} is a product of gamma matrices, it is dimensionless. Thus, we have \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 + \\left[\\kappa\\right] = 4, which simplifies to \\left[\\kappa\\right] = -1. This indicates that \\kappa has mass dimension -1. Regarding renormalizability, since the interaction term has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice is that the mass dimension of \\kappa is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nAnswer:The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=-1.
