proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we need to consider the mass dimensions of the fields and constants in the interaction Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \) is 4. The mass dimension of a Dirac field \( \psi \) is \( \frac{3}{2} \), and the mass dimension of the field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is 2. The \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a combination of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, the mass dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) is \( 3 \), since \( \bar{\psi} \) has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \) and \( \psi \) has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). Thus, the mass dimension of the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). To make the Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L}_{int} \) have dimension 4, \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \( \kappa \) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.
