Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='We compare densities: option a: Earth analog density ~5.5 g/cm^3. Option b: given density ~5.5. Option d: half mass with same composition yields lower density (~4.8). Option c: 5× Earth mass, same composition leads to stronger self-compression raising density above 5.5 (approx ~7–8). Thus c has highest density.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
