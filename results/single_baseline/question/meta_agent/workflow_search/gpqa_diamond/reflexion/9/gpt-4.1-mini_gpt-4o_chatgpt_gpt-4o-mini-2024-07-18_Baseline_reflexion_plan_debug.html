    <pre>To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to consider the mass and volume of each planet. Density is mass divided by volume. 

- Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have the same density as Earth, which is approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
- Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3 already gives us the density, which is 5.5 g/cm^3.
- Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth would likely have a higher density than Earth because as mass increases, the planet&#39;s radius does not increase linearly, leading to a higher density. 
- Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth would likely have a lower density than Earth because it would be less compressed.

Option c) is likely to have the highest density because as planets become more massive, they tend to become more compressed, increasing their density.
