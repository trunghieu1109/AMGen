        "response": "We compare densities: option a: Earth analog density ~5.5 g/cm^3. Option b: given density ~5.5. Option d: half mass with same composition yields lower density (~4.8). Option c: 5\u00d7 Earth mass, same composition leads to stronger self-compression raising density above 5.5 (approx ~7\u20138). Thus c has highest density.\n\nAnswer:C)",
