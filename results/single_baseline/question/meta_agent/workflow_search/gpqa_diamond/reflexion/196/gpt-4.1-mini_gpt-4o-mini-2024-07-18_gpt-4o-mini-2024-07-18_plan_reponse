        "response": "To identify the final product of Compound X after reacting with red phosphorus and HI, we need to analyze the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak around 3400\u20132500 cm-1, indicating the presence of an acidic functional group, likely a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. The NMR data shows signals that correspond to aromatic protons and aliphatic protons, indicating a complex structure. Given the choices, the presence of a carboxylic acid suggests that the product is likely to be a benzoic acid derivative. Among the choices, '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid' fits the description of having a carboxylic acid functional group and matches the expected structure based on the NMR data.\n\nAnswer:B",
