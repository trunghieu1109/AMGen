Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In chromatography (e.g., TLC or column), compounds with similar polarities travel similar distances and their spots overlap (‘on top of each other’). This indicates poor separation due to similar polarity, not bonding, optical rotation, or boiling point issues.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
