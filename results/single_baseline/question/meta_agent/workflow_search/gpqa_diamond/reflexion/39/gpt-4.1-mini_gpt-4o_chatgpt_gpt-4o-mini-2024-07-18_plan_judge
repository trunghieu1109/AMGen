Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating as expected. In a synthetic organic chemistry context, this could mean that during a purification process like chromatography, the compounds are not separating into distinct bands or spots. This is often due to the compounds having similar properties that affect their separation. The most relevant property in this context is polarity, as compounds with similar polarities will travel together in chromatography, leading to them being 'on top of each other'.
