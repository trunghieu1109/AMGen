Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wCan', content="The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating or are overlapping in some way. This is most likely related to their physical properties or interactions. The first choice mentions non-covalent/van der Waals interactions, which could lead to compounds stacking or aggregating. The other choices refer to properties like polarity, optical rotation, and boiling points, which do not directly imply that compounds are physically on top of each other. Therefore, the first choice is the most relevant.\n\nAnswer:A", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
