            "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?",
            "The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.",

        "response": "The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not separating or are overlapping in some way. This is most likely related to their physical properties or interactions. The first choice mentions non-covalent/van der Waals interactions, which could lead to compounds stacking or aggregating. The other choices refer to properties like polarity, optical rotation, and boiling points, which do not directly imply that compounds are physically on top of each other. Therefore, the first choice is the most relevant.\n\nAnswer:A",
