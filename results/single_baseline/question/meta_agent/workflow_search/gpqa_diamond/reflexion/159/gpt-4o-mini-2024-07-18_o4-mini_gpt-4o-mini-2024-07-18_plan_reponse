            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "For N\u2192\u221e the aperture becomes a circular aperture of diameter D=2a. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with minima at ka\u2009sin\u03b8=a\u2009(2\u03c0/\u03bb)\u2009sin\u03b8=xn where xn are zeros of J1: x1\u22483.8317, x2\u22487.0156. Thus \u03b81\u2248x1\u03bb/(2\u03c0a)=3.8317\u03bb/(2\u03c0a)=1.22\u03bb/(2D)=0.61\u03bb/a, \u03b82\u22487.0156\u03bb/(2\u03c0a)=2.23\u03bb/(2D)=1.117\u03bb/a.
