Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: For N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of diameter D=2a. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with minima at ka sinθ=a (2π/λ) sinθ=xn where xn are zeros of J1: x1≈3.8317, x2≈7.0156. Thus θ1≈x1λ/(2πa)=3.8317λ/(2πa)=1.22λ/(2D)=0.61λ/a, θ2≈7.0156λ/(2πa)=2.23λ/(2D)=1.117λ/a. The angular separation Δθ=θ2−θ1≈1.117λ/a−0.61λ/a=0.507λ/a≈0.506λ/a, matching choice 4.
