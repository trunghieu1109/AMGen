Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In the rest frame of the glass the light travels at speed u′=c/n=1/n. The glass itself moves at speed v relative to the lab in the same direction. By the relativistic velocity‐addition formula, the light’s speed u in the lab is u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v), which is choice (3) or C).
