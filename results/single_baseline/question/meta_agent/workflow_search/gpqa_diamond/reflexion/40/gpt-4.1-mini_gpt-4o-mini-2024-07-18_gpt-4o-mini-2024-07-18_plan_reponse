        "response": "To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and the speed of light in glass is c/n. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. Using the formula for the addition of velocities, we substitute u = 1/n (the speed of light in glass) and v (the speed of the glass). After applying the formula and simplifying, we arrive at the correct expression for the speed of light relative to the observer.\n\nAnswer:(1-n*v)/(n+v)",
