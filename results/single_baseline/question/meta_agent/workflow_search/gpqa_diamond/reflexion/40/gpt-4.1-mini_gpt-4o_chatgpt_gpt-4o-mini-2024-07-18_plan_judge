Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer, we need to consider the effects of the glass's motion on the speed of light. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The formula is: v' = (v + u) / (1 + vu/c^2), where v is the velocity of the glass, u is the velocity of light in the glass relative to the glass, and v' is the velocity of light relative to the observer. Here, u = c/n and c = 1, so we have v' = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n). Simplifying this expression gives us the speed of light relative to the observer.
