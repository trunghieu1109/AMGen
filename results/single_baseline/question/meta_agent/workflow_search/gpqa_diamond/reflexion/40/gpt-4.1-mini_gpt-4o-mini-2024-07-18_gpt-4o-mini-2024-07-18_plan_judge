Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and the speed of light in glass is c/n. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. Using the formula for the addition of velocities, we substitute u = 1/n (the speed of light in glass) and v (the speed of the glass). After applying the formula and simplifying, we arrive at the correct expression for the speed of light relative to the observer.

Answer:(1-n*v)/(n+v)
Extracted answer: (1-n*v)/(n+v)
Correct answer: 3
