            "A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?

By the relativistic velocity\u2010addition formula, the light\u2019s speed u in the lab is u=(u\u2032+v)/(1+u\u2032v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v), which is choice (3) or C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
