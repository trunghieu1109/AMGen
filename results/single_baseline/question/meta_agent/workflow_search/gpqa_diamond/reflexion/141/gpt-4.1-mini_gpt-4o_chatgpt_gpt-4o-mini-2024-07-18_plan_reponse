In the Bloch sphere representation, a pure state is represented by a point on the surface of the sphere, while a mixed state is represented by a point inside the sphere. The density matrix given is actually the maximally mixed state, which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2: \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I \\). The Bloch vector \\( \\vec{r} \\) for this state is \\( (0, 0, 0) \\), which is the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nAnswer:A)",
