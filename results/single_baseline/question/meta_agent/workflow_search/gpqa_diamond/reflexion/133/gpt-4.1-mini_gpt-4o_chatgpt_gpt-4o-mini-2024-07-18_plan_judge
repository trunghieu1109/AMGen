proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we need to determine the moles of H+ and OH- ions that react. First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid and dissociates to give 2 H+ per molecule: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+. Total moles of H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates to give 2 OH- per molecule: 0.5 M * 0.2 L * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-. The reaction is H+ + OH- -> H2O, so the limiting reactant is OH- with 0.2 moles. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically -57.1 kJ/mol for strong acid-strong base reactions. Therefore, the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * -57.1 kJ/mol = -11.42 kJ. Converting to kcal, -11.42 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) = -2.72 kcal.
