Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction described involves the formation of a double bond between the cyclohexyl group and the methyl group attached to the nitrogen of 3-methylpyrrolidine. This suggests a condensation reaction where an aldehyde or ketone reacts with an amine to form an imine or enamine. The product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, indicates that a cyclohexylidene group is introduced. This is consistent with the reaction of an aldehyde with an amine to form an imine, followed by tautomerization to an enamine. Therefore, the suitable reagent A should be an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group, which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The catalyst B is likely an acid that can facilitate the condensation reaction, such as TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid).
