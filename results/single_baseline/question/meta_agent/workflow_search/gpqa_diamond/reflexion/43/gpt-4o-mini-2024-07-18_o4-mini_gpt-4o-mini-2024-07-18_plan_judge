Question: Example(question='A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:', choice1='Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant', choice2='Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells', choice3='Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ', choice4="Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide", correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to identify which assay does NOT probe mitochondrial function. Choice 1 uses luciferase to measure ATP levels, reflecting mitochondrial output. Choice 2 stains mitochondria for imaging. Choice 4 uses JC-1 dye to measure mitochondrial membrane potential. Choice 3 measures glucose uptake on isolated mitochondria, but glucose uptake occurs at the plasma membrane, not inside mitochondria, so this assay will not reveal mitochondrial function.
