The first product is 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one, which indicates that the reactant should be 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol. The second product is 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, which suggests that the reactant should be 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one. I will compare these insights with the choices given to find the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one",
