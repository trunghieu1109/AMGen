Question: Example(question='acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)', choice1='12', choice2='10', choice3='5', choice4='8', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: We need to count the number of chemically distinct 1H NMR signals in the final di‐ester nitrile product. The molecule is symmetric (meso), so equivalent halves merge. First, the two ethyl CH3 groups are equivalent → 1 signal. The two ethyl OCH2 groups are equivalent, and we assume their protons are not resolved into diastereotopic pairs → 1 signal. The two methine CH(CN) protons are equivalent → 1 signal. Along the pentane bridge there are three distinct methylene environments: the CH2 adjacent to CH(CN), the next CH2, and the central CH2; both terminal CH2’s on each side are equivalent by symmetry so these three environments give 3 signals. Total = 1 (CH3) + 1 (OCH2) + 1 (CH) + 3 (bridge CH2’s) = 6. However, the two CH2’s adjacent to the CH(CN) and the next CH2 each become diastereotopic due to the chiral center and would each split into two distinct signals, adding 2 additional signals (one for each diastereotopic pair). This yields 6 + 2 = 8 signals, matching choice D.
