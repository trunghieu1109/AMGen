            "Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (\u0277F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the element Y and the compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. The key information is that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, and A5 is obtained by adding Y to a solution of A4. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. The decomposition of A1 suggests it is a higher fluoride of Y, and A2 is a lower fluoride. The oxidation of xenon suggests Y is a strong oxidizer, likely a transition metal or a heavy p-block element. The fluorination of Y to form A3 suggests Y forms a stable fluoride. The decomposition of A5 in water suggests it forms a hydrolysis product. Considering these clues, Y could be a heavy element like iodine or a transition metal. The molecular weight range for A4 is asked, and we have four choices. We need to deduce the likely molecular weight of A4 based on the known properties of the compounds. If we assume Y is iodine, then A4 could be IF5 or IF7, which have molecular weights of 221.9 and 259.9, respectively. However, IF5 is more common and fits the range 220-240. Therefore, the molecular weight of A4 likely falls in the range 220-240.\n\nAnswer:A)",
