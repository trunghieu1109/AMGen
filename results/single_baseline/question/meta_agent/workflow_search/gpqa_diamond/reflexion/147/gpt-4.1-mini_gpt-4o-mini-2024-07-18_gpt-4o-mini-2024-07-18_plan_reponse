            "Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (\u0277F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.",

        "response": "To determine the molecular weight range of substance A4, we need to analyze the information provided about the compounds involving fluorine and element Y. The interactions with xenon and the formation of A5 from A4 suggest that A4 is a significant compound in this series. The molecular weight ranges provided indicate that we should consider typical molecular weights of binary fluorides and their combinations with element Y. Given the context, the most reasonable range for A4's molecular weight is likely to be 160-180, as it aligns better with the expected weights of binary fluorides and their interactions, rather than the heavier range of 220-240.\n\nAnswer:C) 160-180",
