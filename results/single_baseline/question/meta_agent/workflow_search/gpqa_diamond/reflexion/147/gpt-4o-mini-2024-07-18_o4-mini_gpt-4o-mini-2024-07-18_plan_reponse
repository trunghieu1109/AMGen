            "Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (\u0277F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.",

        "response": "We are told A1 decomposes to A2 and F2 at 293 K, and that A2 has wF=31.96%. Let A2=YF_n. Then 19n/(M_Y+19n)=0.3196 \u21d2 M_Y\u2248121.4 for n=3. That matches antimony (M\u2248121.8), so Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. A1=SbF4 (which decomposes to SbF3+F2), A3=SbF5 (direct Sb+F2). A4 must be the colorless \u2018\u2018fluoroantimonic acid\u2019\u2019 HSbF6 made by mixing SbF5 and HF. Its molar mass=1+121.8+6\u00b719=~236.8, which lies in the 220\u2013240 range.\n\nAnswer:A)",
