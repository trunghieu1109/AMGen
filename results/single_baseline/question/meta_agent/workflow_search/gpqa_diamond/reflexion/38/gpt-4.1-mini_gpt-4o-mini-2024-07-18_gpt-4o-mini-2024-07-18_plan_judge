Question: Example(question='We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.1', choice3='0.35', choice4='0.6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the numerical value of 'a', we need to normalize the wave function over the interval from x=1 to x=3. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over this interval equals 1. The absolute square of the wave function is |(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i|^2. We calculate this and integrate it from 1 to 3, then set the result equal to 1 to solve for 'a'.
