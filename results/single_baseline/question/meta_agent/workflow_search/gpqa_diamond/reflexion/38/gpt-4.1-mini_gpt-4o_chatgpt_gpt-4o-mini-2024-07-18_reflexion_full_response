Question: {'question': 'We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?', 'choice1': '0.85', 'choice2': '1.1', 'choice3': '0.35', 'choice4': '0.6'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent vKM3', content="To find the value of 'a', we need to normalize the wave function over the interval where the particles are found, which is x=1 to x=3. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, which is |(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i|^2. We integrate this probability density from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1 to find 'a'. The integral of the probability density over the interval must equal 1 for normalization. After performing the integration and solving for 'a', we find that 'a' must be 0.6 to satisfy the normalization condition.\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
