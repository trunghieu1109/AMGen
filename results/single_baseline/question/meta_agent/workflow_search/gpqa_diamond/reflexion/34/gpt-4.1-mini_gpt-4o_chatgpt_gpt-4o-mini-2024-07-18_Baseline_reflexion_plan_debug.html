    <pre>The operator Ay is given as Ay = c * S, where c = h/4π and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). This matrix S is similar to the Pauli matrix σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c times the eigenvalues of S, which are ±c. Since c = h/4π, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/4π. The eigenvectors of S are the same as those of σ_y, which are (1, i) and (1, -i). The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not necessarily of Az, because Ay and Az do not commute. Therefore, the correct statement is that the eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.
