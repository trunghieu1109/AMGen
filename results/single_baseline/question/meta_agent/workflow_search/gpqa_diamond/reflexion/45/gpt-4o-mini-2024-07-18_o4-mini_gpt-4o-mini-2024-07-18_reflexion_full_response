Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9Uxz', content='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene will undergo self‐metathesis to give the symmetrical internal alkene (and ethene, which is excluded). The dimer has two stereocenters (one in each half) plus the new C=C double bond, which can be E or Z. Coupling of two R centers (RR) gives one enantiomeric pair for E and one for Z; coupling of R and S gives meso‐E and meso‐Z (achiral). Thus we have: RR‐E and SS‐E (enantiomers), RR‐Z and SS‐Z (enantiomers), meso‐E, and meso‐Z. Total distinct stereoisomers = 6.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
