Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene can undergo ring-closing metathesis with Grubbs catalyst, leading to the formation of cyclic products. The racemic nature of the starting material suggests that there are two enantiomers, which can lead to different stereoisomers. Each enantiomer can potentially form different cyclic products based on the position of the double bond and the resulting ring sizes. After considering the possible combinations and the stereochemistry involved, it appears that there are 8 distinct products formed from this reaction.
