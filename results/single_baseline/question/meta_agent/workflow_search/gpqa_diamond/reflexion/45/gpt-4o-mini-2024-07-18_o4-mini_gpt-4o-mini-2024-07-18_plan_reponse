        "response": "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene will undergo self\u2010metathesis to give the symmetrical internal alkene (and ethene, which is excluded). The dimer has two stereocenters (one in each half) plus the new C=C double bond, which can be E or Z. Coupling of two R centers (RR) gives one enantiomeric pair for E and one for Z; coupling of R and S gives meso\u2010E and meso\u2010Z (achiral). Thus we have: RR\u2010E and SS\u2010E (enantiomers), RR\u2010Z and SS\u2010Z (enantiomers), meso\u2010E, and meso\u2010Z. Total distinct stereoisomers = 6.\n\nAnswer:B)",
