Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene will undergo self‐metathesis to give the symmetrical internal alkene (and ethene, which is excluded). The dimer has two stereocenters (one in each half) plus the new C=C double bond, which can be E or Z. Coupling of two R centers (RR) gives one enantiomeric pair for E and one for Z; coupling of R and S gives meso‐E and meso‐Z (achiral). Thus we have: RR‐E and SS‐E (enantiomers), RR‐Z and SS‐Z (enantiomers), meso‐E, and meso‐Z. Total distinct stereoisomers = 6.
