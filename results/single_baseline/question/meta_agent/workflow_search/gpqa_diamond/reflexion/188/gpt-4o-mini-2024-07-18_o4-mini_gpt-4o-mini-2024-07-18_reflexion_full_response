Question: {'question': 'Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', 'choice1': 'Magnon', 'choice2': 'Skyrmion', 'choice3': 'Pion', 'choice4': 'Phonon'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qSLA', content='1. A magnon is a spin wave corresponding to the Nambu–Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken spin‐rotation symmetry in a magnet.\n2. A pion is a Nambu–Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.\n3. A phonon is a Nambu–Goldstone boson due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n4. A skyrmion is a topological soliton (a stable field configuration), not a Goldstone boson from a broken continuous symmetry.\nTherefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
