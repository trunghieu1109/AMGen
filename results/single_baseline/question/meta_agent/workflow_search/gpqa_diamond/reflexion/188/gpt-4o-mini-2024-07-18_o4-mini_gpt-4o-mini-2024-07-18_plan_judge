Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: 1. A magnon is a spin wave corresponding to the Nambu–Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken spin‐rotation symmetry in a magnet.
2. A pion is a Nambu–Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.
3. A phonon is a Nambu–Goldstone boson due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.
4. A skyrmion is a topological soliton (a stable field configuration), not a Goldstone boson from a broken continuous symmetry.
Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the skyrmion.
