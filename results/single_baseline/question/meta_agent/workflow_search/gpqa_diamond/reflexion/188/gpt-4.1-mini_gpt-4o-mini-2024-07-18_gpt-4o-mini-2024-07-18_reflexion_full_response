Question: {'question': 'Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', 'choice1': 'Magnon', 'choice2': 'Skyrmion', 'choice3': 'Pion', 'choice4': 'Phonon'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QYWg', content='To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. Magnons are associated with the breaking of spin symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in systems with chiral symmetry breaking. Pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a lattice and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the other three. Therefore, the answer is Phonon.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
