        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "1. A magnon is a spin wave corresponding to the Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken spin\u2010rotation symmetry in a magnet.\n2. A pion is a Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.\n3. A phonon is a Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n4. A skyrmion is a topological soliton (a stable field configuration), not a Goldstone boson from a broken continuous symmetry.\nTherefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B",
