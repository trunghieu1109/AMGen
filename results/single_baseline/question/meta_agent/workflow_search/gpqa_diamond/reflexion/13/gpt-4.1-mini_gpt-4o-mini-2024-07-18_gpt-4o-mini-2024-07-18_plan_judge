Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes a scenario where ChIP-seq peaks disappear when a different fixation method (PFA+DSG) is used. This suggests that the peaks are likely associated with regions that are sensitive to the fixation method. Active promoters and enhancers are known to be more sensitive to cross-linking conditions, as they are involved in dynamic processes like transcription. Therefore, it is most likely that the disappearing peaks are found at active promoters and enhancers, as these regions are more affected by the fixation method used.
