Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: ChIP-seq is a method used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. It involves cross-linking proteins to DNA, shearing the DNA, immunoprecipitating the protein-DNA complexes, and then sequencing the DNA. PFA (paraformaldehyde) is a common cross-linking agent that can capture protein-DNA interactions. DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is another cross-linker that can capture protein-protein interactions. When ChIP peaks disappear with PFA+DSG fixation, it suggests that the interactions were indirect, possibly mediated by other proteins. Active promoters and enhancers are regions where transcription factors like IKAROS bind directly to DNA, so peaks at these sites are less likely to disappear with DSG. Repeats, introns of large genes, and random locations might have indirect interactions. However, repeats are known to have complex chromatin structures and can be sites of indirect binding. Therefore, disappearing peaks are most likely found at repeats.
