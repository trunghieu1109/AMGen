Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The disappearing peaks under more stringent PFA+DSG crosslinking are characteristic of hyperChIPable regions where transient or non-specific binding in open chromatin is captured by PFA alone but lost when additional crosslinking reduces ChIP artifacts. These regions correspond to active promoters and enhancers.
