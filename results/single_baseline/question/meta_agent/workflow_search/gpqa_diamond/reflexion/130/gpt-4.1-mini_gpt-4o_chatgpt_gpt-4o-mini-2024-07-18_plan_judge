Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR and two peaks in 13C NMR, indicating symmetry. The reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene suggests a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a bicyclic structure. The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3, but differ in stereochemistry. The NOESY cross-peak in the major product indicates spatial proximity between two sets of protons. The choices involve different proton environments. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm likely corresponds to the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene moiety, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm could be bridgehead protons or protons near the anhydride. The cross-peak suggests these protons are spatially close, which is consistent with a Diels-Alder adduct where the methyl groups are close to the bridgehead protons. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that reflects this spatial proximity.
