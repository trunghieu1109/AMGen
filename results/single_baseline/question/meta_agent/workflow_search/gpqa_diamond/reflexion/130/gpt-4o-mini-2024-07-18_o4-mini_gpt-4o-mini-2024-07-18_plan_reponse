            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",
            "A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm",

        "response": "The reaction is a Diels\u2013Alder of maleic anhydride with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, giving endo (major) and exo (minor) norbornene-like adducts. In the endo product the anhydride\u2019s carbonyls lie syn to the bridgehead methylene, placing the endo-facing methyl groups close to those two bridge protons. Thus in the NOESY of the major product one sees a cross-peak between the 6H singlet (endo methyls at ~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet (bridge CH\u2082 at ~3.5 ppm).\n\nAnswer:A)",
