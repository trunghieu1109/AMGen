Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The given potential in polar coordinates V(r,θ)=½kr²+³/₂ kr² cos²θ can be written in Cartesian coordinates using r²=x²+y² and cos²θ=x²/r². Thus V=½k(x²+y²)+³/₂k x²=2k x²+½k y² =½(4k)x²+½(k)y². This describes two independent harmonic oscillators: along x with spring constant 4k (frequency ω_x=√(4k/m)=2√(k/m)) and along y with spring constant k (frequency ω_y=√(k/m)). The energy spectrum is E=(n_x+½)ħω_x + (n_y+½)ħω_y =ħ√(k/m)(2n_x+n_y+3/2), which matches choice1.
