Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The potential V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) can be rewritten as V(r, θ) = (1/2 + 3/2 cos^2(θ))kr^2. This suggests a separation into radial and angular parts. The radial part is a harmonic oscillator, while the angular part modifies the energy levels. The energy levels should reflect the contributions from both parts. The choice E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m) suggests a combination of quantum numbers that might not fully account for the angular dependence. A more careful analysis of the angular part is needed to determine the correct energy spectrum.
