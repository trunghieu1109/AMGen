Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The potential given has both radial and angular components, which suggests that the energy levels will depend on the quantum numbers associated with both dimensions. The correct energy spectrum should reflect the contributions from both the radial and angular parts of the potential. Analyzing the choices again, I need to identify the one that correctly incorporates the contributions from both n_x and n_y in a way that aligns with the potential's structure.

Answer:E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m)
Extracted answer: E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m)
Correct answer: 1
