            "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.",

        "response": "To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we analyze the information provided. Mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating they likely contain double bonds or reactive sites. The hydrogenation of mixture X leads to a hydrocarbon Z with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This suggests that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. The total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X can be inferred from the properties of the compounds involved and the stoichiometry of the reactions. Given the choices provided, we need to find the most reasonable total based on typical structures of hydrocarbons that fit the description. The total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is likely to be 22, as it aligns with common hydrocarbon structures that could lead to the formation of a saturated hydrocarbon Z.\n\nAnswer:A",
