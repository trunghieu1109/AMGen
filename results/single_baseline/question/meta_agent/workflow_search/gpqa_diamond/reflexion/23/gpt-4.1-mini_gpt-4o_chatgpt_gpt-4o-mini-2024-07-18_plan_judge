Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The problem involves an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes. Upon treatment with platinum, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the absence of alkenes. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y results in a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This suggests Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to a molecular formula of C7H8 (toluene), as the mass fraction of hydrogen in toluene is approximately 14.28%. Since Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is formed from hydrogenation of X, mixture X likely contains alkenes that can be hydrogenated to form toluene. The simplest alkenes that can disproportionate to form toluene are styrene (C8H8) and ethylene (C2H4). The total number of hydrogen atoms in styrene and ethylene is 8 + 4 = 12.
