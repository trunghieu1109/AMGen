Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent a26l', content='First identify which neutrino sources contribute in each energy band after removing pp-III (^8B) neutrinos. In the 700–800\u2009keV band only the weak continuum from CNO neutrinos is present (pep is at 1.44\u2009MeV, 7Be lines at 384\u2009keV and 861\u2009keV, pp stops at 420\u2009keV). In the 800–900\u2009keV band the dominant contribution is the monochromatic 7Be line at 861\u2009keV, plus the same small CNO continuum. Numerically, 7Be flux ≃5×10^9\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹, CNO continuum ≃4×10^7\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹ per 100\u2009keV. So flux₁/flux₂ ≃4×10^7/(5×10^9+4×10^7)≈8×10^-3≈10^-2.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
