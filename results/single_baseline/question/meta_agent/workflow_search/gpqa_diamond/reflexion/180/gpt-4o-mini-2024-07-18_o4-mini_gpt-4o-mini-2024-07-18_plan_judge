Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First identify which neutrino sources contribute in each energy band after removing pp-III (^8B) neutrinos. In the 700–800 keV band only the weak continuum from CNO neutrinos is present (pep is at 1.44 MeV, 7Be lines at 384 keV and 861 keV, pp stops at 420 keV). In the 800–900 keV band the dominant contribution is the monochromatic 7Be line at 861 keV, plus the same small CNO continuum. Numerically, 7Be flux ≃5×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹, CNO continuum ≃4×10^7 cm⁻² s⁻¹ per 100 keV. So flux₁/flux₂ ≃4×10^7/(5×10^9+4×10^7)≈8×10^-3≈10^-2.
