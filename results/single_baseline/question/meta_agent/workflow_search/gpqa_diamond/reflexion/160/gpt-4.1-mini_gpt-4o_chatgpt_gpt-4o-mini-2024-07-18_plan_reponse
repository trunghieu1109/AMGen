            "While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be \u03bb1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to \u03bb1; rather, it was \u03bb2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about \u03bb2 based on the aforementioned scenario?",

        "response": "The mean free path \u03bb1 is for gas molecules in the vacuum without the electron beam. When the electron beam is introduced, the mean free path \u03bb2 is for electron scattering with gas molecules. Electrons typically have a longer mean free path than gas molecules due to their smaller size and less frequent interactions. Therefore, \u03bb2 should be greater than \u03bb1. The choice that reflects this understanding is '\u03bb2 >= 1.22*\u03bb1', indicating that \u03bb2 is significantly greater than \u03bb1.\n\nAnswer:D)",
