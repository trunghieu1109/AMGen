            "While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be \u03bb1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to \u03bb1; rather, it was \u03bb2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about \u03bb2 based on the aforementioned scenario?",

        "response": "First, the classical mean free path of gas molecules is \u03bb1=kT/(\u221a2\u2009P\u2009\u03c3), where \u03c3 is the molecular collision cross\u2010section. For electron scattering off those same gas molecules, only the gas molecules have a thermal speed distribution, while the high\u2010energy electrons have a nearly mono\u2010energetic, much higher velocity. One finds that the \u221a2 factor in the denominator disappears in the electron\u2010molecule mean free path, giving \u03bb2=kT/(P\u2009\u03c3). Hence \u03bb2/\u03bb1=\u221a2\u22481.414. Thus \u03bb2>\u03bb1, in fact exceeding 1.22\u2009\u03bb1.\n\nAnswer:D)",
