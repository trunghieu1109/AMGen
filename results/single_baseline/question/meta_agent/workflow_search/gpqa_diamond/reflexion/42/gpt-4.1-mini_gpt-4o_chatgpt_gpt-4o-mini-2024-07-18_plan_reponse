            "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n",

        "response": "To determine the correct IUPAC name, we need to analyze the structure of the benzene ring with the given substituents. The carboxylic acid group is the principal functional group, so it will be at position 1. The groups are meta to each other, so we place the carboxylic acid at position 1, the cyano group at position 3, and the formyl group at position 5. The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions 2 and 6, respectively. The methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 4. The methoxy and alcohol are ortho to the nitrile, which is consistent with this arrangement. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nAnswer:A)",
