            "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n",

        "response": "We need to name a benzene ring with COOH (priority) at position 1, and five other substituents. The COOH, CHO and CN are meta to one another, so CHO and CN occupy two of the meta positions (3 and 5). A methoxy group is para (4), and OH and NMe2 occupy the two ortho positions (2 and 6). The methoxy (4) and OH must both be ortho to the CN. This is possible only if CN is at 5, giving OH at 6 and OMe at 4. The remaining substituent (CHO) goes to 3 and NMe2 to 2. Numbering starts at COOH (1) and proceeds through NMe2 at 2, CHO at 3, OMe at 4, CN at 5, OH at 6. For the lowest set of locants by alphabetical order of substituent prefixes, the first substituent at 2 is dimethylamino (D) vs hydroxy (H) if reversed, so 2-NMe2 is correct. The substituents are then listed alphabetically: cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M). This matches choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)",
