            "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n",

        "response": "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule, we need to analyze the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid is the highest priority functional group, and we will number the ring starting from the carboxylic acid. The carbaldehyde (formyl) and cyano groups are meta to each other and to the carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, while the methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are also ortho to the cyano group. After analyzing the positions and the names of the substituents, the correct IUPAC name that reflects all these substituents and their positions is '3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid'.\n\nAnswer:choice2",
