            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton in the 1H NMR spectrum, along with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, suggests that the compound may exist in two different forms. The LC-MS analysis showing two peaks of equal intensities with the same mass spectrum indicates that these forms are chemically similar. The most plausible explanation for this observation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which can lead to different environments for the same proton, resulting in the observed peaks. However, the possibility of conformational isomerism or other equilibria should also be considered. Given the options, the best fit is still diastereoisomers, as they can lead to the observed NMR pattern.\n\nAnswer:B",
