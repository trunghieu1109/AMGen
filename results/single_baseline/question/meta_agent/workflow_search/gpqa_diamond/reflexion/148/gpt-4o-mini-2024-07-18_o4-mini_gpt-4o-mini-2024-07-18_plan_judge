Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The two peaks for the same proton with equal integrals, separate LC peaks at elevated temperature but identical mass spectra all point to two stereoisomers that interconvert slowly or are stable under LC and NMR conditions. Epimerization at the α-carbon during coupling would give diastereomeric peptides: same mass, different retention and chemical shifts. Enantiomers wouldn’t separate on achiral LC or NMR, contamination would show different mass or integrals, and double coupling would alter the mass.
