            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The observations suggest that the compound exists in two forms that are chemically identical but differ in some structural aspect. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which suggests the presence of two distinct environments for this proton. The LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, indicating two forms with the same molecular weight. Enantiomers would not show different peaks in NMR or LC-MS under normal conditions, as they are identical in achiral environments. Diastereoisomers, however, can have different NMR chemical shifts and can be separated by LC-MS, as they are not mirror images and have different physical properties. The 'double coupling' explanation does not fit the observations, as it would not result in two distinct peaks with the same mass. Contamination with a precursor would likely show a different mass spectrum. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\nAnswer:B)",
