Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question contrasts Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) with Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY). Both arise from nondisjunction during meiosis, but Klinefelter’s patients typically exhibit milder phenotypes. This is because one of the two X chromosomes in XXY individuals undergoes X-inactivation early in embryogenesis. X-inactivation is mediated by chromatin modifications, including histone methylation, to silence one X chromosome. Thus, the extra X is largely transcriptionally inactive, reducing phenotypic impact. This mechanism corresponds to choice 3: chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote.
