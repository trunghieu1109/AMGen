            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).",

        "response": "To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone can exhibit tautomerism due to its ability to form keto-enol pairs, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit such behavior. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Next, for optical isomerism, we need to look at the structures of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist as enantiomers, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and cannot show optical isomerism. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism. Based on this analysis, the correct choices are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate",
