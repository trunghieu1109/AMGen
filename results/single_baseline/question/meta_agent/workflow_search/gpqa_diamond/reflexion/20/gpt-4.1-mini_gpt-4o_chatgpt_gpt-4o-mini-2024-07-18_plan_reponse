            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).",
            "A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate",
            "A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate",
            "A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate",

        "response": "To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to consider the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a stable compound that does not exhibit tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. For optical isomerism, we need to check for chirality. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:C)",
