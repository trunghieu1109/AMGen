Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to identify which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B). Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and undergoes keto-enol tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and does not tautomerize. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the 2-carbon (–CH(OH)–), but dimethyl fumarate (an alkene with identical substituents) is achiral. Thus A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice 3.
