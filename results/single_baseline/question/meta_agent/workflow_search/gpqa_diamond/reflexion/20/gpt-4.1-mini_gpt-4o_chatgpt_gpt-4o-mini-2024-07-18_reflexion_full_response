Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kdyo', content='To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to consider the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a stable compound that does not exhibit tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. For optical isomerism, we need to check for chirality. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
