Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kdyo', content='We need to identify which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B). Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and undergoes keto-enol tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and does not tautomerize. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the 2-carbon (–CH(OH)–), but dimethyl fumarate (an alkene with identical substituents) is achiral. Thus A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
