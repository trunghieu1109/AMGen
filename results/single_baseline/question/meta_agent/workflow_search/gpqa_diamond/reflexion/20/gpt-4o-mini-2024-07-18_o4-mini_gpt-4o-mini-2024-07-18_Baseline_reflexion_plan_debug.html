    <pre>We need to identify which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B). Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and undergoes keto-enol tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and does not tautomerize. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the 2-carbon (–CH(OH)–), but dimethyl fumarate (an alkene with identical substituents) is achiral. Thus A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice 3.
