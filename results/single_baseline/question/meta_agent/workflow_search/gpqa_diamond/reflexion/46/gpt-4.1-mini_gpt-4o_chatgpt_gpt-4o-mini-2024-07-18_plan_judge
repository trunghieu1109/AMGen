Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), which is characteristic of a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2 group, and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3 group, suggesting an ethyl group. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be an NH2 group. The doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Considering these data, the compound is likely to be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an ethyl ester group, a para-substituted aromatic ring, and an NH2 group.
