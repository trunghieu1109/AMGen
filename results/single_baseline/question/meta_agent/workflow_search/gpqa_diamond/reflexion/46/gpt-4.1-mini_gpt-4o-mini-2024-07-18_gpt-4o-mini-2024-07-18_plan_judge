Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The provided IR and NMR data suggest the presence of functional groups and structural features that can help identify the compound C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum indicates hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, while the NMR data shows signals consistent with an ethyl group and aromatic protons. The integration and multiplicity of the NMR signals must be carefully matched with the proposed structures in the choices. After re-evaluating the options based on the spectral data, the correct compound that fits the molecular formula and the spectral characteristics is '4-aminophenyl propionate'.
