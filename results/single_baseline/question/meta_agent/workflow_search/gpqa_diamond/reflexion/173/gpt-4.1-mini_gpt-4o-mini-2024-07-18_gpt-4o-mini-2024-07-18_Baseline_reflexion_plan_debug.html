    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;20 MeV.&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent w7FQ (yourself):
To solve the problem, we first need to understand the mass distribution after the fission. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m and the mass of the heavier fragment be 2m. According to the problem, the total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, which means: m + 2m = 0.99M, leading to 3m = 0.99M, thus m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the initial mass M corresponds to this energy. After fission, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The energy released in the fission is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. This energy will be converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. Using conservation of momentum and energy, we can find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) in a relativistic way. In the classical approximation, we would use the formula for kinetic energy T = (1/2)mv^2, which would yield a different value for T1. The difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical T1 can be calculated, and we can compare it to the provided choices to find the correct answer.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent w7FQ (yourself):
20 MeV.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent iDTZ:
The reasoning provided is mostly correct, but the final answer of 20 MeV may not be accurate without detailed calculations. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy should be carefully derived using the correct formulas and conservation laws. The choice of 20 MeV needs to be verified against the calculations.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
