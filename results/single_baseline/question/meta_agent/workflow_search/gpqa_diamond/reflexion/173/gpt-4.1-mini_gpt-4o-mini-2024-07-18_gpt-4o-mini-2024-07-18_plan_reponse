            "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)",

        "response": "To find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the classical kinetic energy calculated using the non-relativistic approximation, we first need to determine the masses of the fragments. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m and the heavier fragment be 2m. Given that the total mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, we have m + 2m = 0.99M, leading to 3m = 0.99M, thus m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the energy released in the fission is 3 GeV. This energy is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. Using conservation of momentum and energy, we can find T1 in a relativistic way. The classical approximation would yield a different value for T1. The difference between the two values can be calculated and compared to the provided choices to find the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:20 MeV.",
