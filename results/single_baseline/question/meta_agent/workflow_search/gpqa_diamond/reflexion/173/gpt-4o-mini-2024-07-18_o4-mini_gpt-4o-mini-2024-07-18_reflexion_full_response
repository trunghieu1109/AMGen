Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ViMF', content='We have an initial nucleus of mass M with rest energy 300 GeV that fissions into two fragments of rest masses m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99 M, so ΔE=(M–(m1+m2))c^2=0.01Mc^2=3 GeV is converted to kinetic energy. Classically, by momentum conservation m1v1=m2v2, the kinetic energy splits as T1/T2=m2/m1=1/2, so T1_classical=1/3⋅3 GeV=1 GeV. Relativistically, let m1c^2=198 GeV, m2c^2=99 GeV. Solve sqrt((198)^2+(pc)^2)+sqrt((99)^2+(pc)^2)=300 GeV gives pc≈19.97 GeV. Then E1=sqrt(198^2+(pc)^2)≈199.005 GeV, so T1_rel=E1–198 GeV≈1.005 GeV. The difference ΔT=1.005 GeV–1 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
