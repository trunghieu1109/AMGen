Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, we need to determine the rest masses of the two fragments. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, then the rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m, which is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, 3m = 0.99M, giving m = 0.33M. The rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV/c^2. The rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The energy released in the fission is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let p be the momentum of the lighter fragment, then the momentum of the heavier fragment is -p. The total energy of the lighter fragment is E1 = sqrt((0.33M)^2c^4 + p^2c^2), and the total energy of the heavier fragment is E2 = sqrt((0.66M)^2c^4 + p^2c^2). The kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is T1 = E2 - 0.66Mc^2. In the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is T1_classical = p^2/(2 * 0.66M). We need to find the difference T1 - T1_classical. Using the energy conservation, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, so the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Solving for p and using the relativistic and classical expressions for kinetic energy, we find the difference is approximately 10 MeV.
