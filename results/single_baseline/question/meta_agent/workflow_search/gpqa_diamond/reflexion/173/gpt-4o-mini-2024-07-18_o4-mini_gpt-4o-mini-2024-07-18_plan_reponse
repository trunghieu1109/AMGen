            "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)",

        "response": "We have an initial nucleus of mass M with rest energy 300 GeV that fissions into two fragments of rest masses m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99 M, so \u0394E=(M\u2013(m1+m2))c^2=0.01Mc^2=3 GeV is converted to kinetic energy. Classically, by momentum conservation m1v1=m2v2, the kinetic energy splits as T1/T2=m2/m1=1/2, so T1_classical=1/3\u22c53 GeV=1 GeV. Relativistically, let m1c^2=198 GeV, m2c^2=99 GeV. Solve sqrt((198)^2+(pc)^2)+sqrt((99)^2+(pc)^2)=300 GeV gives pc\u224819.97 GeV. Then E1=sqrt(198^2+(pc)^2)\u2248199.005 GeV, so T1_rel=E1\u2013198 GeV\u22481.005 GeV. The difference \u0394T=1.005 GeV\u20131 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)",
