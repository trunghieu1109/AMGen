            "reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?",

        "response": "To determine the molecular symmetry group of product E, we need to analyze the information given about the reactions and the nature of the products. The symmetry groups provided are C2, C2v, D4h, and D\u221eh. Without specific structural information about E, we can infer that if E is extremely hazardous, it might have a more complex structure, possibly indicating a higher symmetry. D4h is a high symmetry group that includes square planar and octahedral geometries, while D\u221eh is associated with linear molecules. Given the context, D4h could be a reasonable assumption for a complex hazardous molecule. However, without more specific details about the structure of E, it's difficult to definitively choose. Based on common knowledge of hazardous compounds, D4h is a plausible symmetry group for a complex molecule. Therefore, I will choose D4h as the answer.\n\nAnswer:D4h",
