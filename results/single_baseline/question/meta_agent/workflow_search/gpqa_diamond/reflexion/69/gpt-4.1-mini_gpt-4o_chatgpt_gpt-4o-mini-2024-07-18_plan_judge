proposed answer: To determine the molecular symmetry group of E, we need to deduce the identities of the compounds involved. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. This suggests that C could be a phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) type compound, where A is phosphorus (P) and B is chlorine (Cl2). C (PCl5) reacts with water to form phosphoric acid (H3PO4, strong acid F) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, weak acid G). When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it forms hazardous product E. If D is ammonia (NH3), then E could be phosphine (PH3), which is hazardous. The symmetry group of PH3 is C3v. However, if D is hydrogen (H2), then E could be phosphine (PH3) as well, which still has C3v symmetry. The reaction of D with B to form H, a solvent, suggests D could be hydrogen (H2) and B could be chlorine (Cl2), forming HCl, which is a solvent in some cases. However, the most likely scenario is that E is PH3, which has C3v symmetry. None of the given choices match C3v, so we need to reconsider. If E is a different hazardous compound, such as PCl3, it would have C3v symmetry as well. However, the choices given do not match C3v. If we consider the possibility of a different hazardous compound, such as PCl5, it would have D3h symmetry, but this is not a choice either. The most likely hazardous compound with a symmetry group from the choices given is PCl3, which has C3v symmetry, but this is not a choice. Therefore, we must consider the possibility of a different interpretation. If E is a linear molecule, such as Cl2, it would have D∞h symmetry. Given the choices, D∞h is the most plausible symmetry group for a hazardous compound that could be formed in this context.
