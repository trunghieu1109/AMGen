Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to evaluate the provided options. Each of the issues listed can lead to errors, but we need to identify which combination is most representative of common problems. The confusion between 'chr' and 'no chr' is a frequent issue, as is reference assembly mismatch. Incorrect ID conversion can also lead to significant errors. Therefore, the option that includes the most relevant issues should be selected.
