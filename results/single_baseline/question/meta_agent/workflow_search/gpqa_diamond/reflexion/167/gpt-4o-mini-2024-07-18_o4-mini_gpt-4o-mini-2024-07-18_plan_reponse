While data format incompatibilities often trigger immediate failures or clear error messages, the latter three issues\u2014chromosome naming mismatches, using the wrong genome assembly, and ID conversion problems\u2014tend to silently propagate errors and produce subtly flawed results. Therefore, the most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors are issues 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
