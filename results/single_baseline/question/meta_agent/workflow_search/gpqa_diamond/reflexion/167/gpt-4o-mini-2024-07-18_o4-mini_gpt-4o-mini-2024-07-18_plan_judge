Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question lists four potential issues that can introduce hard-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis: 1) incompatible data formats, 2) “chr”/“no chr” chromosome naming inconsistencies, 3) reference assembly mismatches, and 4) incorrect ID conversion. While data format incompatibilities often trigger immediate failures or clear error messages, the latter three issues—chromosome naming mismatches, using the wrong genome assembly, and ID conversion problems—tend to silently propagate errors and produce subtly flawed results. Therefore, the most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors are issues 2, 3, and 4.
