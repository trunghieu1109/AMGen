Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: 1. Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which nitrates the benzene to form nitrobenzene (product 1). 2. Nitrobenzene is treated with Br2 and iron powder, which brominates the benzene ring to form 3-bromonitrobenzene (product 2). 3. 3-bromonitrobenzene is reduced with Pd/C under hydrogen to form 3-bromoaniline (product 3). 4. 3-bromoaniline is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4 to form 3-bromo-4-fluorobenzene diazonium salt (product 4). 5. The diazonium salt is heated to release N2 and form 3-bromofluorobenzene, which is then treated with anisole to form 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl (final product 5).
