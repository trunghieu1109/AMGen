        "response": "Let x = [Ca2+], then stoichiometric EDTA dissociation yields [EDTA]=x and [CaEDTA]=0.02\u2013x. The formation constant K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) = (0.02\u2013x)/(x^2) \u2248 0.02/x^2 (since x\u226a0.02). Thus x^2 \u2248 0.02/5\u00d710^10 = 4\u00d710^\u201313, so x \u2248 \u221a(4\u00d710^\u201313) = 6.3\u00d710^\u20137 M.\n\nAnswer:C)",
