        "response": "To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA. The reaction can be represented as: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc Ca-EDTA^2-. Given that KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10 and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, we can set up the equilibrium expression. Assuming that the concentration of Ca^2+ is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is approximately 0.02 M (since x is small), we can write KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * 0.02). Solving for x gives us the concentration of Ca^2+. The large value of KCa-EDTA indicates that the complexation is very favorable, leading to a very low concentration of free Ca^2+. After careful calculation, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C",
