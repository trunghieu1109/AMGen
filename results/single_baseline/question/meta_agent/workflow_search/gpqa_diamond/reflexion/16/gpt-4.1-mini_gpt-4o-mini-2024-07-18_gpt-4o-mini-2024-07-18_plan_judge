Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA. The reaction can be represented as: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA^2-. Given that KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10 and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, we can set up the equilibrium expression. Assuming that the concentration of Ca^2+ is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is approximately 0.02 M (since x is small), we can write KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * 0.02). Solving for x gives us the concentration of Ca^2+. The large value of KCa-EDTA indicates that the complexation is very favorable, leading to a very low concentration of free Ca^2+. After careful calculation, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.
