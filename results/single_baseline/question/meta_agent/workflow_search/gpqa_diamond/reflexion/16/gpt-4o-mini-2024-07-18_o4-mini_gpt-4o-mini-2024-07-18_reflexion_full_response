Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UPac', content='Let x = [Ca2+], then stoichiometric EDTA dissociation yields [EDTA]=x and [CaEDTA]=0.02–x. The formation constant K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) = (0.02–x)/(x^2) ≈ 0.02/x^2 (since x≪0.02). Thus x^2 ≈ 0.02/5×10^10 = 4×10^–13, so x ≈ √(4×10^–13) = 6.3×10^–7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
