        "response": "The problem involves a Ca-EDTA complex with a given formation constant (KCa-EDTA). The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The formation constant KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10 indicates the equilibrium between Ca2+ ions, EDTA, and the Ca-EDTA complex. The equilibrium expression is KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]). Assuming that the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M and that it dissociates slightly, we can set up the equilibrium expression. Let x be the concentration of Ca2+ ions at equilibrium. Then, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca2+] = x, and [EDTA] = x. Plugging these into the equilibrium expression gives 5x10^10 = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Since K is very large, x is very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. Thus, 5x10^10 \u2248 0.02/x^2, leading to x^2 \u2248 0.02/5x10^10. Solving for x gives x \u2248 sqrt(0.02/5x10^10) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-7. Therefore, the concentration of Ca2+ ions is approximately 2x10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)",
