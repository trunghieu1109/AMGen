Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Use the method of images. A point charge q at distance d from center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R induces an image charge q' = - (R/d) q located at distance a = R^2/d from center. The separation between real and image charges is d - a = (d^2 - R^2)/d. The interaction energy is U_int = k q q' / (d - a), but the net potential energy of assembling the system with a grounded conductor is half this: U = (1/2) U_int = (1/2) * k q * (-(R/d) q) / [(d^2 - R^2)/d] = - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2).
