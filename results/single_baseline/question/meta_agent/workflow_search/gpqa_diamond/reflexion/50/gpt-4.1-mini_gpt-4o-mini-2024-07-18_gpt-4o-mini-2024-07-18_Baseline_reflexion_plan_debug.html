    <pre>To find the net potential energy of the system with a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, we need to consider the method of images. The potential energy can be derived from the interaction between the charge and the induced charge on the sphere. The correct formula for the potential energy in this configuration is typically derived from the method of images, leading to the expression that accounts for the distance and the radius of the sphere. After analyzing the choices, the correct expression for the potential energy is found to be U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2).
