        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the method of image charges. When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, an image charge q' is placed inside the sphere to satisfy the boundary conditions. The image charge q' is located at a distance R^2/d from the center of the sphere, and its magnitude is q' = -qR/d. The potential energy of the system is due to the interaction between the real charge q and the image charge q'. The potential energy U is given by the formula U = k * q * q' / (d - R^2/d), where k is Coulomb's constant. Substituting q' = -qR/d, we get U = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2). This matches choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
