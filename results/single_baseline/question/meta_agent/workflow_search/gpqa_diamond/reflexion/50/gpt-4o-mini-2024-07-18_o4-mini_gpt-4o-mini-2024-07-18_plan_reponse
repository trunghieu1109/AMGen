        "response": "Use the method of images. A point charge q at distance d from center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R induces an image charge q' = - (R/d) q located at distance a = R^2/d from center. The separation between real and image charges is d - a = (d^2 - R^2)/d. The interaction energy is U_int = k q q' / (d - a), but the net potential energy of assembling the system with a grounded conductor is half this: U = (1/2) U_int = (1/2) * k q * (-(R/d) q) / [(d^2 - R^2)/d] = - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2).\n\nAnswer:A)",
