Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2, we can use the relationship between the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital periods. The mass function for binary stars indicates that the mass of the system is related to the amplitude of the radial velocity variations and the orbital period. We can calculate the mass ratio using the given amplitudes and periods for both systems. The mass of a binary system can be approximated using the formula that relates the mass to the radial velocity amplitude and the orbital period. After performing the calculations, we can determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.
