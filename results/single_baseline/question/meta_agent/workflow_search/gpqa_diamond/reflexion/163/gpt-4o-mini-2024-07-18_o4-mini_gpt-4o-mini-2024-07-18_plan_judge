Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Compute total mass via Kepler’s law: M ∝ (K1+K2)^3 P. Convert K-sum to AU/yr (1 km/s≈0.2109 AU/yr). For system1: (10+5)=15 km/s→3.1635 AU/yr, P=2→M1∝3.1635^3·2≈63.3. For system2: (15+10)=25 km/s→5.2725 AU/yr, P=1→M2∝5.2725^3·1≈146.6. Ratio≈63.3/146.6≈0.432≈0.4.
