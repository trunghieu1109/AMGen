Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, we use the formula: <S_y> = (psi)^dagger * (S_y operator) * (psi), where psi is the spin state and the S_y operator is given by (hbar/2) * sigma_y. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), which we can write as a column vector: psi = [3i, 4]. The sigma_y matrix is given as: sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Therefore, the S_y operator is (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. We first calculate the action of the S_y operator on the state psi: S_y * psi = (hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4] = (hbar/2) * [4, -3]. Next, we calculate the conjugate transpose of psi, which is (psi)^dagger = [-3i, 4]. The expectation value <S_y> is then: <S_y> = [-3i, 4] * (hbar/2) * [4, -3] = (hbar/2) * (12i - 12i) = 0. Therefore, the expectation value is 0.
