Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we will apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We know that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. The uncertainty in momentum Δp can be calculated as Δp = m * Δv, where m is the mass of the electron and Δv can be approximated as v since we are considering the uncertainty in position. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can then be calculated using ΔE = Δp * v. We will perform the calculations step by step to ensure accuracy.
