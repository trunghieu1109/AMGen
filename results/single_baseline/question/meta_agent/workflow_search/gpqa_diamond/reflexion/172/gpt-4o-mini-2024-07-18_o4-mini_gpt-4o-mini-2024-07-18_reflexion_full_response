Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent nc0F', content='Step 1: Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10^(-10) m and electron speed v = 2×10^8 m/s.\nStep 2: Use Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2, so Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx).\nStep 3: ħ ≈ 1.055×10^(-34) J·s, so Δp ≈ (1.055×10^(-34) J·s)/(2×1×10^(-10) m) ≈ 5.275×10^(-25) kg·m/s.\nStep 4: Kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m). For small Δp, ΔE ≈ (dE/dp)·Δp = (p/m)·Δp = v·Δp.\nStep 5: Thus ΔE ≈ v·Δp ≈ (2×10^8 m/s)·(5.275×10^(-25) kg·m/s) ≈ 1.055×10^(-16) J ≈ 10^(-16) J.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
