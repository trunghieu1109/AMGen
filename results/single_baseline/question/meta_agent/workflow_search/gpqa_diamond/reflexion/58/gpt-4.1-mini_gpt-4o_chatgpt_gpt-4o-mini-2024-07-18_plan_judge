Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the pH of the solution, we need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each component and find the net concentration of H+ or OH- in the final solution. First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Next, calculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 moles (since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per molecule). For CH3COOH, it is a weak acid, but we can consider its initial moles: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. However, the strong acid and base will dominate. The net moles of OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. The total volume of the solution is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.10 moles / 1.2 L = 0.0833 M. The pOH = -log(0.0833) = 1.08. The pH = 14 - pOH = 12.92.
