Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging in these values, we get v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6*0.5)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. For the total energy, we use the relativistic energy formula E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). For the first astronaut, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1.25, and for the second astronaut, gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1.1547. The total energy is E = gamma1 * 2m * c^2 + gamma2 * 3m * c^2 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 + 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 = 5.9641mc^2, which is approximately 5.96mc^2.
