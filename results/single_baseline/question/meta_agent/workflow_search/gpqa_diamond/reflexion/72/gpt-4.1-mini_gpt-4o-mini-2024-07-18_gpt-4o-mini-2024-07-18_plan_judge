Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2 / c^2)). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging in these values, we calculate the relative speed. For the total energy, we need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut using E = γmc^2, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). We calculate γ for each astronaut and then find the total energy of the system by summing their energies. After careful consideration, the correct total energy should be recalculated to ensure accuracy.

Answer:v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5mc^2
Extracted answer: v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5mc^2
Correct answer: 1
