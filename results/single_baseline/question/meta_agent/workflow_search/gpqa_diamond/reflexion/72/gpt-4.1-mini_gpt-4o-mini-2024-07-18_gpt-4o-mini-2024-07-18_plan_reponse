        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "To find the relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2 / c^2)). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging in these values, we calculate the relative speed. For the total energy, we need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut using E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). We calculate \u03b3 for each astronaut and then find the total energy of the system by summing their energies. After careful consideration, the correct total energy should be recalculated to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnswer:v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5mc^2",
