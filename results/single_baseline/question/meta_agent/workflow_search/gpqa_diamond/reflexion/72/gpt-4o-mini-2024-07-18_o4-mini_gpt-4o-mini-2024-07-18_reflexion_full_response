Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zsdh', content='First, compute the relative velocity of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 v2 / c^2). Here v1 = 0.6 c and v2 = 0.5 c, so v_rel = (0.6 c - 0.5 c) / (1 - 0.6·0.5) = 0.1 c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1429 c ≈ 0.14 c. Next, compute each astronaut’s relativistic energy: E1 = γ1 m1 c^2 with m1 = 2m, γ1 = 1/√(1 - 0.6^2) = 1.25, so E1 = 2m·1.25 c^2 = 2.5 m c^2. E2 = γ2 m2 c^2 with m2 = 3m, γ2 = 1/√(1 - 0.5^2) ≈ 1.1547, so E2 = 3m·1.1547 c^2 ≈ 3.4641 m c^2. The total energy is E = E1 + E2 ≈ (2.5 + 3.4641) m c^2 ≈ 5.9641 m c^2 ≈ 5.96 m c^2. Matching to the given choices gives choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
