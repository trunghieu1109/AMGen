            "When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.

        "response": "First, recognize that the bicyclic epoxide is simply an epoxycyclohexane (the O bridge at C-1/C-6) bearing Me substituents at C-1, C-3 and C-4.  Upon treatment with Me2CuLi, ring opening occurs at the less hindered epoxide carbon (C-6), with inversion there.  The alkoxide at C-1 is then protonated to give a cyclohexanol.  Thus the four Me\u2019s end up at (new) C-1 (original C-1), C-2 (original C-6), C-4 (orig. C-4) and C-5 (orig. C-3), all retaining R configuration except C-2 which inverts from S\u2192R.  Numbering the cyclohexanol (OH at C-1) and choosing the direction that gives lowest locants for the Me substituents yields (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, i.e. choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
