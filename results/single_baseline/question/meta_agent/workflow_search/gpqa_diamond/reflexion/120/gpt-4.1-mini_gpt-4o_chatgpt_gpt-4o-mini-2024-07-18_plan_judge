Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The compound (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a bicyclic epoxide. When reacted with Me2CuLi, the methyl group from the organocuprate will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, which is the carbon at position 6. This attack leads to ring opening and inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. The resulting product will have a new methyl group at the position where the epoxide was opened, and the stereochemistry will be inverted at that carbon. The product will be a cyclohexanol derivative with the methyl group added at the less hindered position, and the stereochemistry will be adjusted accordingly. The correct product should match the stereochemistry of the options given.
