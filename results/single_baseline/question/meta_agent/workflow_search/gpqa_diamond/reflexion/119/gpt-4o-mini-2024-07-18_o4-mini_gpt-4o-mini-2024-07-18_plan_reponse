        "response": "Assume a uniform stellar density n in space. The number of stars between distances d and d+dd is dN = 4\u03c0n d^2 dd. Parallax p is related to distance by d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p^2, and |dd| = (1/p^2)|dp|. Substituting d = 1/p into d^2 gives (1/p^2), so per unit parallax dN/dp = 4\u03c0n (1/p^2) (1/p^2) \u221d 1/p^4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
