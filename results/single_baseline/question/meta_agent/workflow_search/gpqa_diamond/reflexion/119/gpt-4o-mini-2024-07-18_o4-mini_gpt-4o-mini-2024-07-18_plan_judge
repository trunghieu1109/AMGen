Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Assume a uniform stellar density n in space. The number of stars between distances d and d+dd is dN = 4πn d^2 dd. Parallax p is related to distance by d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p^2, and |dd| = (1/p^2)|dp|. Substituting d = 1/p into d^2 gives (1/p^2), so per unit parallax dN/dp = 4πn (1/p^2) (1/p^2) ∝ 1/p^4.
