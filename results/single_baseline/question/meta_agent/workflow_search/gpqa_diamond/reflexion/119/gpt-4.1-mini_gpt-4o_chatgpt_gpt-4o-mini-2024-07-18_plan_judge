Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell at a distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is proportional to r^2 (since volume of a shell is 4Ï€r^2dr). The parallax plx is inversely proportional to the distance r (plx = 1/r for small angles in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). Therefore, r = 1/plx. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is proportional to (1/plx)^2. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^2.
