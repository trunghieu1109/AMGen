Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UD2w', content='Assume a uniform stellar density n in space. The number of stars between distances d and d+dd is dN = 4πn d^2 dd. Parallax p is related to distance by d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p^2, and |dd| = (1/p^2)|dp|. Substituting d = 1/p into d^2 gives (1/p^2), so per unit parallax dN/dp = 4πn (1/p^2) (1/p^2) ∝ 1/p^4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
