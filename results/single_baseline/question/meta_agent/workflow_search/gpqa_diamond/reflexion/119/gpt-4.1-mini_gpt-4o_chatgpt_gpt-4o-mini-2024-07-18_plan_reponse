        "response": "If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell at a distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is proportional to r^2 (since volume of a shell is 4\u03c0r^2dr). The parallax plx is inversely proportional to the distance r (plx = 1/r for small angles in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). Therefore, r = 1/plx. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is proportional to (1/plx)^2. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
