Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2wxi', content='If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell at a distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is proportional to r^2 (since volume of a shell is 4Ï€r^2dr). The parallax plx is inversely proportional to the distance r (plx = 1/r for small angles in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). Therefore, r = 1/plx. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is proportional to (1/plx)^2. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
