Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is related to the volume of space that corresponds to a given parallax. The distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax (d = 1/plx). The volume of space increases with the cube of the distance, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax will decrease with the cube of the distance. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx as ~ 1/plx^3.
