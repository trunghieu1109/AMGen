            "Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.",

Choice2 rewrites these as qc/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080(dc\u2212d\u00b7v)) and \u03bc\u2080qc v/(4\u03c0(dc\u2212d\u00b7v)), matching the standard form, whereas the other choices are either static fields or have incorrect signs. Therefore the correct answer is choice2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
