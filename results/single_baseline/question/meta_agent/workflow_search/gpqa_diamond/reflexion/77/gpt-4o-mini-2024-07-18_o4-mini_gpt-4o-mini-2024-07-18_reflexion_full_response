Question: {'question': 'Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent CjuO', content='The retarded potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard–Wiechert potentials: V(r,t)=q/(4πε₀)[1/(d−d·v/c)] and A(r,t)=μ₀qv/(4π[d−d·v/c]). Choice2 rewrites these as qc/(4πε₀(dc−d·v)) and μ₀qc v/(4π(dc−d·v)), matching the standard form, whereas the other choices are either static fields or have incorrect signs. Therefore the correct answer is choice2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
