            "Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.",

        "response": "To determine the correct expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge, we need to consider the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential V and vector potential A depend on the position and velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr. The correct expressions involve the distance d from the charge to the observation point and the velocity vector of the charge. The choices provided include different forms of these potentials, and we need to identify which one aligns with the standard results from electromagnetic theory.\n\nAnswer:V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}",
