proposed answer: We have three vicinal diols undergoing Pinacol rearrangement. The favored 1,2-shift is that which leaves behind the more stabilized cation. 

For A (3-methyl-4-phenylpentane-3,4-diol), protonation of the OH at C3 and loss of water gives a tertiary cation at C3. From C4 the ethyl group (â€“CH2CH3) migrates more readily than phenyl because ethyl migration leaves a benzylic cation at C4, whereas phenyl migration would leave a simple secondary cation. The resulting ketone is pentan-2-one with substituents at C3: ethyl and phenyl, i.e. 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

For B (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol), protonation of OH at C2 yields a resonance-stabilized benzylic cation at C2. A 1,2-shift of the aryl group from C3 to C2 leaves the cation at C3, which collapses to the ketone at C3. Numbering to give the carbonyl lowest locant gives pentan-2-one with two aryl substituents at C3, one being the p-hydroxyphenyl: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

For C (1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol), protonation of OH at C1 and loss of water gives the cation at C1. A 1,2-shift of a 4-methoxyphenyl from C2 to C1 is favored over phenyl migration because it leaves a benzylic cation at C2. The OH at C2 then becomes the ketone. Numbering so the carbonyl is at C1 gives the product 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.

These match choice1.
