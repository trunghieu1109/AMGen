Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime and then use its velocity to find the distance. The lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \), where \( \Gamma_X = 320 \text{ MeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582119569 \times 10^{-22} \text{ MeV s} \). The velocity \( v \) can be found using the relativistic relation \( v = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X c^2}{E_X}\right)^2} \), where \( m_X = 1.2 \text{ GeV} \), \( E_X = 8 \text{ GeV} \), and \( c \) is the speed of light. Finally, the mean decay distance \( d \) is \( d = v \tau \).
