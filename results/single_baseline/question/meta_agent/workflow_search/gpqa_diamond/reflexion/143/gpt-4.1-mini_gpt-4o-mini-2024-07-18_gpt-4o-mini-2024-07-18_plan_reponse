        "response": "To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can use the relation between the decay width (\u0393) and the mean lifetime (\u03c4) of the particle. The mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u210f / \u0393, where \u210f is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s). We can convert the width from MeV to Joules using the conversion factor 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J. After calculating \u03c4, we can find the mean decay distance using the formula d = \u03b2c\u03c4, where \u03b2 is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (c). The energy E and mass m can be used to find \u03b2. The calculations yield the mean decay distance, which we can then compare to the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:5.0223 * 10^-16 m",
