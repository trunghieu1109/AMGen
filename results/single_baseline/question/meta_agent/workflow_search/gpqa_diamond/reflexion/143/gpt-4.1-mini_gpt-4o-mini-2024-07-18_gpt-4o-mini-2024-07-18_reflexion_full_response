Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Rbm0', content="To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can use the relation between the decay width (Γ) and the mean lifetime (τ) of the particle. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ℏ / Γ, where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 J·s). We can convert the width from MeV to Joules using the conversion factor 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J. After calculating τ, we can find the mean decay distance using the formula d = βcτ, where β is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (c). The energy E and mass m can be used to find β. The calculations yield the mean decay distance, which we can then compare to the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:5.0223 * 10^-16 m", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
