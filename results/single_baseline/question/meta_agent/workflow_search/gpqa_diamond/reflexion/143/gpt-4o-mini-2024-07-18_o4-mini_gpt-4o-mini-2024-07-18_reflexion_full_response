Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 7yCH', content='We want the mean decay distance L = βγcτ. The resonance width Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV gives lifetime τ = ħ/Γ ≈ (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) = 2.056×10^-24 s. The Lorentz factor γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.667. Assuming β≈1, L ≈ γ·c·τ ≈ 6.667·(3×10^8 m/s)·(2.056×10^-24 s) ≈ 4.11×10^-15 m. The closest choice is 4.0655×10^-15 m.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
