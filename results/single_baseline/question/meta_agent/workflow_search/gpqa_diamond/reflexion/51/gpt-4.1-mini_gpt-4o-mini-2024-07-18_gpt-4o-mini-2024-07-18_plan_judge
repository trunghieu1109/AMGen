Question: Example(question="Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.", choice1='~2.9', choice2='~4.5', choice3='~7.8', choice4='~1.1', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we can use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the formula: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * (e^(-ΔE/kT)), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies of the levels, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases from 6000K to 5500K. We can calculate the change in the ratio using the temperatures and the energy difference corresponding to the wavelength of 1448 Å. The energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. After calculating the energy difference and applying the temperatures, we can find the ratio change. The calculations lead to a factor of approximately 4.5, which corresponds to choice 2.
