Question: Example(question='Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.\n1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A\n(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C', choice1='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice2='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', choice3='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice4='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: For A: the acid‐catalyzed reaction of the N,O-acetal (aminal) with an allylic alcohol undergoes an aza-Prins/Claisen‐type cyclization to give a 6-membered O/N heterocycle, i.e. 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. Only choices 3 and 4 have this. For C: the vinyl ether undergoes a thermal Claisen rearrangement to yield an unsaturated aldehyde (not an alcohol), i.e. 4-methylenehexanal. Only choices 1 and 3 give the aldehyde. Thus A and C point to choice 3. For B: the 1,5-diyne with vicinal Me substituents undergoes a double sigmatropic rearrangement (the terminal π bonds migrate into the central σ) to give a cyclobutane with two exocyclic alkenes. Retention of original stereochemistry (R,S) leads to one E and one Z alkene, i.e. (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane. That matches choice 3. Therefore the correct multiple‐choice letter is C.
