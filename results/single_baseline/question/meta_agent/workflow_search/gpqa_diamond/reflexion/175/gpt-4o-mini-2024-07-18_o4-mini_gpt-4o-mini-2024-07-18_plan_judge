Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First normalize the state ψ=(–1,2,1) so ||ψ||²=6. Operator P has eigenvalue 0 eigenvector v₀=(1,0,–1)/√2. The amplitude ⟨v₀|ψ⟩=–√2, so ⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩=–√2/√6=–1/√3, giving P(P=0)=1/3. After collapse the state is v₀, and Q=–1 corresponds to |3⟩=(0,0,1), so probability P(Q=–1|P=0)=|⟨3|v₀⟩|²=1/2. Joint probability=(1/3)(1/2)=1/6, which is choice B).
