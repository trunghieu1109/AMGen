            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

        "response": "First normalize the state \u03c8=(\u20131,2,1) so ||\u03c8||\u00b2=6. Operator P has eigenvalue 0 eigenvector v\u2080=(1,0,\u20131)/\u221a2. The amplitude \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9=\u2013\u221a2, so \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8_norm\u27e9=\u2013\u221a2/\u221a6=\u20131/\u221a3, giving P(P=0)=1/3. After collapse the state is v\u2080, and Q=\u20131 corresponds to |3\u27e9=(0,0,1), so probability P(Q=\u20131|P=0)=|\u27e83|v\u2080\u27e9|\u00b2=1/2. Joint probability=(1/3)(1/2)=1/6, which is choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
