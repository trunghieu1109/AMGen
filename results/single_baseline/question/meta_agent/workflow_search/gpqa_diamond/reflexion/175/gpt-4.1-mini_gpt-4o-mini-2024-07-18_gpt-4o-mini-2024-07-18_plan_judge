Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we first need to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices for P and Q. The measurement of P gives us the probability of measuring 0, and then we will use the resulting state to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q. The matrix for P has an eigenvalue of 0 with a corresponding eigenvector, and we will normalize this eigenvector to find the probability. After measuring P, we will project the state onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of 0, and then use this new state to measure Q and find the probability of getting -1. After performing the calculations, we find that the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/3.
