Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To parallelize the computation of the matrix exponential using fractional (rational) approximations, one rewrites the approximation in a partial fraction form. This decomposes the problem into a sum of independent resolvent computations (each involving (I − tA/λ_k)^{-1}), which can be executed concurrently. This linear partial fraction decomposition is the key step that converts the inherently sequential algorithm into a parallel one.
