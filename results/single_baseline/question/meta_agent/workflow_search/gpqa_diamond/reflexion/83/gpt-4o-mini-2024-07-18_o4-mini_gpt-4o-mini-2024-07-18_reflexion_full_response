Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hvkM', content='To parallelize the computation of the matrix exponential using fractional (rational) approximations, one rewrites the approximation in a partial fraction form. This decomposes the problem into a sum of independent resolvent computations (each involving (I − tA/λ_k)^{-1}), which can be executed concurrently. This linear partial fraction decomposition is the key step that converts the inherently sequential algorithm into a parallel one.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
