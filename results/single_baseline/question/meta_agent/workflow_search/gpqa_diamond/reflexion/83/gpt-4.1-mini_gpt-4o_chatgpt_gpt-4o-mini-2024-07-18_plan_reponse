        "response": "To convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, we need to consider how the computations can be divided and executed concurrently. In the context of approximating the matrix exponential function using a fractional approximation, the key factor would be related to how the approximation can be split into independent parts that can be computed in parallel. The options given are: 1) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions, 2) Stability analysis, 3) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation, and 4) Complex roots of fractional approximation. The linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation suggests a way to decompose the problem into simpler parts that can be computed independently, which is a common technique in parallel computing. Therefore, the key factor is likely the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation.\n\nAnswer:C)",
