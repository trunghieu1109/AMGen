Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Upon reevaluating the compounds for optical isomerism, I recognize that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate can exist as two enantiomers due to its geometric isomerism, which qualifies it for optical isomerism as well. Therefore, both compounds 2 and 4 show optical isomerism. The other compounds, benzophenone and dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, do not exhibit optical isomerism. Thus, the correct answer includes both methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, leading to the conclusion that choice 4 (1, 2 and 4) is the correct answer.
