            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "Optical isomerism occurs in compounds with chiral centers. Let's analyze each compound: 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound could potentially show optical isomerism if the biphenyl structure is hindered from rotating freely, but typically it does not have a chiral center. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the second carbon, making it capable of optical isomerism. 3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center and does not show optical isomerism. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is a trans-alkene and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism. Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n\nAnswer:1 and 2",
