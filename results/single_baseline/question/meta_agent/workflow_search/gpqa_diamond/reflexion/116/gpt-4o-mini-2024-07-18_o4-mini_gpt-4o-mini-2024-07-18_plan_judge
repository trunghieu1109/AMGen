Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to identify which compounds are chiral (optical isomers).
1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: biphenyl with ortho substituents prevents free rotation, giving stable atropisomers => chiral.
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate): has a stereogenic alpha-carbon => chiral.
3. benzophenone: planar ketone, no stereocenter => achiral.
4. dimethyl fumarate: trans-alkene with identical substituents, plane of symmetry => achiral.
Thus only 1 and 2 are optically active, corresponding to choice2.
