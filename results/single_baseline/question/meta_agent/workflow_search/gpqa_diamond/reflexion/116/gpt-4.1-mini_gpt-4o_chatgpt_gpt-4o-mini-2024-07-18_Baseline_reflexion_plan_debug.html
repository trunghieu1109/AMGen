    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5I2v (yourself):
Optical isomerism occurs in compounds that have chiral centers, meaning they have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound has a biphenyl structure, which can exhibit chirality if the substituents on the biphenyl rings are such that they prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. However, without specific substituents that create chirality, it may not show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon with the hydroxy group), making it capable of optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers, as it is a simple ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon. It does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is a trans-alkene, and while it can have geometric isomers (cis/trans), it does not have a chiral center and thus does not show optical isomerism.

Based on this analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) is the only one that shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes compound 2.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5I2v (yourself):
2 and 3

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent gaoZ:
The analysis correctly identifies that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism. However, the choice &#39;2 and 3&#39; is incorrect because benzophenone (compound 3) does not have a chiral center and does not show optical isomerism. The correct choice should only include compound 2.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound could potentially show optical isomerism if the biphenyl structure is hindered from rotating freely, but typically it does not have a chiral center. 2.

Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center and does not show optical isomerism. 4.
