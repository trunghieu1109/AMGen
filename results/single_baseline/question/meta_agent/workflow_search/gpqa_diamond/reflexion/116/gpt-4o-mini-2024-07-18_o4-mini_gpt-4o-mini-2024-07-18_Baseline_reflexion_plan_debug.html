    <pre>We need to identify which compounds are chiral (optical isomers).
1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: biphenyl with ortho substituents prevents free rotation, giving stable atropisomers =&gt; chiral.
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate): has a stereogenic alpha-carbon =&gt; chiral.
3. benzophenone: planar ketone, no stereocenter =&gt; achiral.
4. dimethyl fumarate: trans-alkene with identical substituents, plane of symmetry =&gt; achiral.
Thus only 1 and 2 are optically active, corresponding to choice2.
