    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2vga (yourself):
To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or if they can exist as non-superimposable mirror images. Optical isomerism typically arises from the presence of chiral centers. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound has multiple substituents and can potentially have chiral centers, but the biphenyl structure may lead to symmetry that could prevent optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon with the hydroxyl group, thus it can show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center and is symmetrical, so it does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound has a double bond and can exist in two geometric isomers (cis and trans), but it does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2, which includes the only compound that shows optical isomerism.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2vga (yourself):
B

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent oZtn:
The analysis correctly identifies that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism due to its chiral center. However, it incorrectly states that dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate can exist as two enantiomers due to its geometric isomerism, which is a form of stereoisomerism. Therefore, the correct answer should include both methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, making choice 4 (1, 2 and 4) the correct answer instead of choice 2.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>Upon reevaluating the compounds for optical isomerism, I recognize that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate can exist as two enantiomers due to its geometric isomerism, which qualifies it for optical isomerism as well. Therefore, both compounds 2 and 4 show optical isomerism. The other compounds, benzophenone and dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate, do not exhibit optical isomerism. Thus, the correct answer includes both methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, leading to the conclusion that choice 4 (1, 2 and 4) is the correct answer.
