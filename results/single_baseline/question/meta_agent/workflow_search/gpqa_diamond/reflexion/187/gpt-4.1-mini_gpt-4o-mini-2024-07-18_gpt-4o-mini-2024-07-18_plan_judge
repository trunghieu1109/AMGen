Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we can use the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral lattice, which is given by: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (cos(α)cos(β)cos(γ) + cos(β)cos(γ)cos(α) + cos(γ)cos(α)cos(β)))). Here, we have α = β = γ = 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance a = 10 Angstrom. We need to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane, which means h = 1, k = 1, l = 1. First, we calculate the denominator: h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3. Next, we calculate the cosine terms: cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, the term in the square root becomes: 1 - 3 * (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = 1 - 3 * (3√3/8) = 1 - (9√3/8). We can simplify this and find the interplanar distance d_111. After performing the calculations, we find that the interplanar distance d_111 is approximately 9.08 Angstrom.
