Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8Lu3', content='For a rhombohedral cell with a = 10 Å and α = β = γ = 30°, use the general interplanar spacing formula 1/d² = (1/(a²Δ)) [ (h²+k²+l²) sin²α − 2(hk+hl+kl)(cosα − cos²α ) ], where Δ = 1 − 3cos²α + 2cos³α. Here h = k = l = 1, cos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sin²30° = 0.25. Compute cos²α = 0.75, cos³α ≈ 0.6495, so Δ = 1 − 2.25 + 1.2990 ≈ 0.0490. The numerator = 3×0.25 − 2×3×(0.8660 − 0.75) = 0.053847. Thus 1/d² = 0.053847/(100×0.049038) ≈ 0.01098, so d ≈9.541 Å. This matches choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
