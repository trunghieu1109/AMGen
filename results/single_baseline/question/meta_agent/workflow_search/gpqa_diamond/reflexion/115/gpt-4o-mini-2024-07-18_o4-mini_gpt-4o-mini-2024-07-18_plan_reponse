            "Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.",

        "response": "The NMR of A (6H triplet at 0.9 ppm, 4H quartet at 1.3 ppm) matches n-butane. Radical bromination gives 2-bromobutane B, which on elimination yields cis- and trans-2-butene C. The cis isomer undergoes an endo Diels\u2013Alder with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to give a cyclohexene bearing three methyls (two from the dienophile, one from the diene) and an OH at C1. Endo approach places all three methyls syn, i.e. cis to each other at C4, C5, C6. Of the choices, only (1S,4R,5S,6S) has C5 and C6 both having the same configuration, so the answer is A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
