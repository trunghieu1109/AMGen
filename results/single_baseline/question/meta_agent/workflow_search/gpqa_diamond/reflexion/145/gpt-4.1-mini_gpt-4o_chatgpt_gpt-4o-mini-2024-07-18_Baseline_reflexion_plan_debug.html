    <pre>5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene can undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. In this case, the diene is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and the dienophile is maleic anhydride. The reaction will proceed with the formation of a new six-membered ring. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the endo rule, which states that the endo product is favored. The endo product is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (in this case, the carbonyl groups of maleic anhydride) are oriented towards the electron-rich diene in the transition state. This leads to the formation of a bicyclic structure with specific stereochemistry. The fluorine substituent on the diene will influence the stereochemistry of the product. Based on the endo rule and the stereochemistry of the starting materials, the major product is likely to be (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.
