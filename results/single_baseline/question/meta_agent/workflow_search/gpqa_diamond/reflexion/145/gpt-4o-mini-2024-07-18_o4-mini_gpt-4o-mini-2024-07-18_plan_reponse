        "response": "In the Diels\u2013Alder reaction of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene with maleic anhydride, the endo approach is favored, placing the anhydride syn to the bridge and the small fluorine substituent in the exo position. In the bicyclic product the exo substituent at C-8 corresponds to the S configuration. Only choice 2 has C-8 as S while preserving the correct endo stereochemistry at the other centers.\n\nAnswer:B)",
