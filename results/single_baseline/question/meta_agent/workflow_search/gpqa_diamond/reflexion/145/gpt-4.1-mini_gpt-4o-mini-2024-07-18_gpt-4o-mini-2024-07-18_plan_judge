Question: Example(question='5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What is the major product?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the major product of the reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride, we need to analyze the Diels-Alder reaction mechanism. The diene (5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride) will react to form a cyclohexene derivative. The stereochemistry of the product is crucial, and we need to identify which of the given choices corresponds to the most stable and correctly oriented product. After careful consideration of the stereochemistry and stability, the correct choice should be identified.
