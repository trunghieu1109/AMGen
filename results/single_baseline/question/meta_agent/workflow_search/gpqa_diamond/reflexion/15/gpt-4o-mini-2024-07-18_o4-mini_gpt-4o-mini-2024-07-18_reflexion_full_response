Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bD3a', content='We need to count how many of the seven listed compounds are chiral (optically active).\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no stereocenter → achiral.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: two stereocenters, no internal mirror → chiral.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso (internal mirror) → achiral.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: enantiomeric form → chiral.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on ring → chiral.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters all on same face → chiral (propeller-like, no internal mirror).\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no stereocenter (two identical methyls at C-3) → achiral.\n\nChiral compounds are #2, #4, #5, #6 → total 4.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
