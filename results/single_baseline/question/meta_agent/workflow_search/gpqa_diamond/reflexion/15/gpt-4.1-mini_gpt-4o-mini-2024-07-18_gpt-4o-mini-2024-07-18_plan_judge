proposed answer: To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is not superimposable on its mirror image. Let's evaluate each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene - This compound has a double bond and does not have a chiral center, so it is not optically active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione - This compound has chiral centers and is optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid - This compound has two chiral centers and is optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid - This compound also has two chiral centers but is a meso compound, thus it is not optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol - This compound has one chiral center and is optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol - This compound has multiple hydroxyl groups but is symmetric and does not have a chiral center, so it is not optically active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one - This compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

Now, counting the optically active compounds: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are optically active. Therefore, there are 4 compounds that exhibit optical activity.
