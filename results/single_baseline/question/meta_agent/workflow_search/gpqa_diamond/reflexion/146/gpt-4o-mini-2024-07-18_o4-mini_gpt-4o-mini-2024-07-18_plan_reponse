        "response": "We have the reaction p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. The antiproton is essentially at rest, so the total initial energy is 2m_pc\u00b2 \u2248 2\u00d7938\u2009MeV = 1876\u2009MeV. The rest energy for the four A particles is 4\u00d7300\u2009MeV = 1200\u2009MeV, leaving 1876\u22121200 = 676\u2009MeV of kinetic energy to share equally among them. Each A thus has kinetic energy KE = 676/4 = 169\u2009MeV, giving a total energy E = 300 + 169 = 469\u2009MeV. The Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = E/(mc\u00b2) = 469/300 \u2248 1.563, so \u03b2 = \u221a(1\u22121/\u03b3\u00b2) = \u221a(1\u22121/1.563\u00b2) \u2248 0.77.\n\nAnswer:C)",
