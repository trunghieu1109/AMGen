Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the velocity of particle A in the annihilation process, we need to apply conservation of energy and momentum principles. The initial energy consists of the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton, plus the kinetic energy of the slowly moving antiproton. After the annihilation, we have two particles A, each with mass m_A = 300 MeV/c^2. We can calculate the total energy and momentum before and after the annihilation to determine the velocity of particle A. After performing the calculations, the velocity of particle A is found to be approximately 0.91c.
