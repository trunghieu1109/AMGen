        "response": "In the annihilation process, a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The rest energy of the proton and antiproton is approximately 938 MeV each. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume its kinetic energy is negligible. The total energy available for the creation of the A particles is therefore 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV, so the total rest mass energy for the four A particles is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy, 1876 MeV - 1200 MeV = 676 MeV, is the kinetic energy of the four A particles. Since the particles are produced in pairs, we can assume they share this kinetic energy equally. Therefore, each A particle has a kinetic energy of 676 MeV / 4 = 169 MeV. The total energy of each A particle is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, which is 300 MeV + 169 MeV = 469 MeV. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2, we can solve for the velocity of the A particle. The momentum p is given by p = sqrt((E/c)^2 - (m_0c)^2). The velocity v is given by v = pc^2 / E. Substituting the values, we find v = sqrt(1 - (m_0c^2/E)^2) * c = sqrt(1 - (300/469)^2) * c = 0.91c.\n\nAnswer:B)",
