proposed answer: We have the reaction p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is essentially at rest, so the total initial energy is 2m_pc² ≈ 2×938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The rest energy for the four A particles is 4×300 MeV = 1200 MeV, leaving 1876−1200 = 676 MeV of kinetic energy to share equally among them. Each A thus has kinetic energy KE = 676/4 = 169 MeV, giving a total energy E = 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. The Lorentz factor is γ = E/(mc²) = 469/300 ≈ 1.563, so β = √(1−1/γ²) = √(1−1/1.563²) ≈ 0.77.
