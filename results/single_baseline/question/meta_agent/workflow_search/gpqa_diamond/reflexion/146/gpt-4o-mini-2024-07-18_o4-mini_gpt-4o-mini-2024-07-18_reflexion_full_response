Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zUtU', content='We have the reaction p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is essentially at rest, so the total initial energy is 2m_pc² ≈ 2×938\u2009MeV = 1876\u2009MeV. The rest energy for the four A particles is 4×300\u2009MeV = 1200\u2009MeV, leaving 1876−1200 = 676\u2009MeV of kinetic energy to share equally among them. Each A thus has kinetic energy KE = 676/4 = 169\u2009MeV, giving a total energy E = 300 + 169 = 469\u2009MeV. The Lorentz factor is γ = E/(mc²) = 469/300 ≈ 1.563, so β = √(1−1/γ²) = √(1−1/1.563²) ≈ 0.77.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
