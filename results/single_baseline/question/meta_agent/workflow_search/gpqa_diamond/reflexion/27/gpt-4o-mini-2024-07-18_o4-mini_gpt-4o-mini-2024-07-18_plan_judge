Question: Example(question='S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice2='(2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice3="(1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol", choice4='(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We start with S-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one (4S). Protecting the OH gives 1. Ph2CuLi does a 1,4-addition, delivering Ph to C3 from the face opposite the bulky TBSO at C4, giving 3R. The resulting enolate is then alkylated with benzyl bromide at C2, delivering Bn trans to Ph (to minimize sterics), giving 2S. LDA/iodomethane at C6 gives Me trans to Bn at C2, giving 6S. Finally, HCl deprotects TBS to OH at C4 (retaining 4S). Thus product 4 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one, choice A).
