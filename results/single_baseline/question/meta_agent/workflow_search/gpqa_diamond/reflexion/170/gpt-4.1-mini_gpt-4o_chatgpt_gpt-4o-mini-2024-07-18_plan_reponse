        "response": "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups like alkyl groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) are ortho/para-directing, while deactivating groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta-directing. Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The more activating the group, the higher the yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order from least to most para-isomer yield is: 4 (NO2, strongly deactivating, meta-directing) < 6 (COOH, deactivating, meta-directing) < 2 (COOC2H5, deactivating, meta-directing) < 1 (CH3, activating, ortho/para-directing) < 5 (C2H5, activating, ortho/para-directing) < 3 (Cl, ortho/para-directing but less activating than alkyl groups).\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
