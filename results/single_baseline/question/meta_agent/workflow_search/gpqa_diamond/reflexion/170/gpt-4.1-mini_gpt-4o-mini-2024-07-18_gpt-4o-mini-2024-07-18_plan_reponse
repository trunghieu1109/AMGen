        "response": "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as -CH3 and -C2H5 will direct bromination to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as -NO2 and -COOH will direct bromination to the meta position. The order of influence on the para yield will depend on the strength of these effects. Generally, EDGs increase the yield of para-substituted products, while EWGs decrease it. Based on this reasoning, we can analyze the substances: 1) -CH3 (EDG), 2) -COOC2H5 (EDG), 3) -Cl (weakly EWG), 4) -NO2 (strong EWG), 5) -C2H5 (EDG), 6) -COOH (strong EWG). The substances can be arranged based on their substituents' effects on the para yield. After careful consideration, the correct order is found to be 4<6<2<1<5<3, which corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
