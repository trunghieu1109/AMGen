Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent faZf', content='We are to rank the substituents by the fraction of para‐brominated product in their electrophilic bromination mixtures. Strong meta directors (–NO2, –COOH, –COOEt) give almost exclusively meta with very little para, and among these –NO2 is the strongest deactivator so its para‐fraction is essentially zero, followed by –COOH then –COOEt. Next come the ortho/para directors: CH3 (toluene) and C2H5 (ethylbenzene) give moderate para (≈20–30%), and Cl gives the highest para fraction among these. Thus the increasing order is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which is choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
