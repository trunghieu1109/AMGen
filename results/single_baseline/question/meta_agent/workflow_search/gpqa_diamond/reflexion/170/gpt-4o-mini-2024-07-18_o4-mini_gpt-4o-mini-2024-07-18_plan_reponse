        "response": "We are to rank the substituents by the fraction of para\u2010brominated product in their electrophilic bromination mixtures. Strong meta directors (\u2013NO2, \u2013COOH, \u2013COOEt) give almost exclusively meta with very little para, and among these \u2013NO2 is the strongest deactivator so its para\u2010fraction is essentially zero, followed by \u2013COOH then \u2013COOEt. Next come the ortho/para directors: CH3 (toluene) and C2H5 (ethylbenzene) give moderate para (\u224820\u201330%), and Cl gives the highest para fraction among these. Thus the increasing order is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which is choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
