            "Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?",

        "response": "Under LTE, the level population N\u221dexp(\u2212\u0394E/(kT)). The ratio of populations for the same level in star1 and star2 is N1/N2=exp[\u0394E*(1/(kT2)\u22121/(kT1))]. Given N1/N2=2, ln2=\u0394E/k*(T1\u2212T2)/(T1T2). Ignoring the constant for the functional form yields ln2=(T1\u2212T2)/(T1T2), which matches choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
