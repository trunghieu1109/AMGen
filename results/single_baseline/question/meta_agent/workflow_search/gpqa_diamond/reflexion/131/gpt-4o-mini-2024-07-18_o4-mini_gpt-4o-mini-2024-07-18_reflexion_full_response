Question: {'question': 'The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hg4h', content='We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatics showing two aromatic singlets (each 2\u2009H) ⇒ each isomer has 2 equivalent aromatic H’s. All tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,3,4-; 1,2,3,5-; and 1,2,4,5-) satisfy this. 1,4-diethylbenzene is ruled out (would show CH2/CH3 couplings). The methyl region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio ⇒ three signals after one overlap of two eq environments (giving the large 2-unit peak) from two tetramethylbenzenes. The only pair in the choices that gives two aromatic singlets plus a methyl pattern with one overlapping methyl signal is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:A', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
