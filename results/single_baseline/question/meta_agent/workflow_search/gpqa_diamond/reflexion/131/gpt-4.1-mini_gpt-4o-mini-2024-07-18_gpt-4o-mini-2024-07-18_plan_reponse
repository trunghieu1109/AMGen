            "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.",

        "response": "To determine which two compounds are present in the mixture, we analyze the NMR signals. The presence of two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio suggests that there are two different aromatic protons that are equivalent in each compound. The three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio indicate that there are different types of protons in the aliphatic region, likely due to the presence of methyl groups. The compounds listed have different arrangements of methyl and ethyl groups, which will affect the NMR signals. By examining the structures of the compounds, we can deduce which two would give the observed NMR pattern.\n\nAnswer:1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene",
