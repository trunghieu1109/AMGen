    <pre>We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatics showing two aromatic singlets (each 2 H) ⇒ each isomer has 2 equivalent aromatic H’s. All tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,3,4-; 1,2,3,5-; and 1,2,4,5-) satisfy this. 1,4-diethylbenzene is ruled out (would show CH2/CH3 couplings). The methyl region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio ⇒ three signals after one overlap of two eq environments (giving the large 2-unit peak) from two tetramethylbenzenes. The only pair in the choices that gives two aromatic singlets plus a methyl pattern with one overlapping methyl signal is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
