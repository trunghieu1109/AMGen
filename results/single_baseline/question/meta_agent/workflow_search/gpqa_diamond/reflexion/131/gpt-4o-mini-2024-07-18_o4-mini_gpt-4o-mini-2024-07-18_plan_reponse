            "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.",

        "response": "We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatics showing two aromatic singlets (each 2\u2009H) \u21d2 each isomer has 2 equivalent aromatic H\u2019s. All tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,3,4-; 1,2,3,5-; and 1,2,4,5-) satisfy this. 1,4-diethylbenzene is ruled out (would show CH2/CH3 couplings). The methyl region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio \u21d2 three signals after one overlap of two eq environments (giving the large 2-unit peak) from two tetramethylbenzenes. The only pair in the choices that gives two aromatic singlets plus a methyl pattern with one overlapping methyl signal is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:A",
