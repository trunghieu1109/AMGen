Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction between an alkene and bromine typically results in the addition of bromine across the double bond. In this case, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added, it will add across this double bond, resulting in a dibromo compound. The enol group (OH) is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond, so the addition of bromine will result in a dibromo alcohol. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, leading to a trans product. Therefore, the major product is likely to be a dibromo alcohol with trans stereochemistry.
