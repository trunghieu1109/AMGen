        "response": "The reaction between an alkene and bromine typically results in the addition of bromine across the double bond. In this case, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added, it will add across this double bond, resulting in a dibromo compound. The enol group (OH) is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond, so the addition of bromine will result in a dibromo alcohol. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, leading to a trans product. Therefore, the major product is likely to be a dibromo alcohol with trans stereochemistry.\n\nAnswer:C)",
