        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "The reaction sequence involves forming an enolate from cyclohexanone using LDA, which then reacts with benzaldehyde in an aldol reaction to form a beta-hydroxy ketone. Upon acidification, this forms product 1. When product 1 is treated with DAST, the hydroxyl group is converted to a fluoride, and the stereochemistry at that carbon is inverted. Therefore, the final product 2 will have a fluorine where the hydroxyl group was, with inverted stereochemistry.\n\nAnswer:C",
