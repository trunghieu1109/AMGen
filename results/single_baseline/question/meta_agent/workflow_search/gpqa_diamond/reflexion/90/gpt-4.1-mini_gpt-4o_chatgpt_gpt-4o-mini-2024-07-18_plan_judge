Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.\n\n1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?', choice1='(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one', choice2='((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', choice3='(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', choice4='((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction sequence involves forming an enolate from cyclohexanone using LDA, which then reacts with benzaldehyde in an aldol reaction to form a beta-hydroxy ketone. Upon acidification, this forms product 1. When product 1 is treated with DAST, the hydroxyl group is converted to a fluoride, and the stereochemistry at that carbon is inverted. Therefore, the final product 2 will have a fluorine where the hydroxyl group was, with inverted stereochemistry.
