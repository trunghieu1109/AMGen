        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "Cyclohexanone under LDA gives the enolate that adds to benzaldehyde, forming the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone. Excess DAST then converts the ketone C=O into a geminal difluoride and the secondary alcohol into a fluoride by an SN2 process, inverting that stereocenter. The result is a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl group bearing a fluoromethyl phenyl substituent with inverted configuration. This matches choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
