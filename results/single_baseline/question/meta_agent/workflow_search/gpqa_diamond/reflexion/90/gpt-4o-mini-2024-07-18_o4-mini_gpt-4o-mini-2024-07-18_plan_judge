Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.\n\n1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?', choice1='(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one', choice2='((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', choice3='(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', choice4='((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Cyclohexanone under LDA gives the enolate that adds to benzaldehyde, forming the Î²-hydroxy ketone. Excess DAST then converts the ketone C=O into a geminal difluoride and the secondary alcohol into a fluoride by an SN2 process, inverting that stereocenter. The result is a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl group bearing a fluoromethyl phenyl substituent with inverted configuration. This matches choice 4.
