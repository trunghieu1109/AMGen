            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "To determine the correct fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 and the corresponding dependence on wavelength, I need to analyze the provided choices. The typical behavior of radiation from oscillating charge distributions suggests that the power radiated varies with angle and wavelength in specific ways. I will evaluate each choice to find the one that correctly represents the fraction of power at the specified angle and its dependence on wavelength.\n\nAnswer:1/4, \\lambda^(-4)",
