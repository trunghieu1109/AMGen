            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "The radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge along z behaves like an electric dipole: P(\u03b8) \u221d sin^2\u03b8 with maximum at \u03b8=90\u00b0. Thus at \u03b8=30\u00b0, fraction = sin^2(30\u00b0)=1/4. Dipole radiation power \u221d \u03c9^4 \u221d \u03bb^(\u20134). Hence the correct choice is 1/4, \u03bb^(\u20134), i.e. choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
