Question: {'question': 'Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', 'choice1': '1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice2': '3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', 'choice3': '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice4': '1/4, \\lambda^(-3)'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 7FQi', content='The radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge along z behaves like an electric dipole: P(θ) ∝ sin^2θ with maximum at θ=90°. Thus at θ=30°, fraction = sin^2(30°)=1/4. Dipole radiation power ∝ ω^4 ∝ λ^(–4). Hence the correct choice is 1/4, λ^(–4), i.e. choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
