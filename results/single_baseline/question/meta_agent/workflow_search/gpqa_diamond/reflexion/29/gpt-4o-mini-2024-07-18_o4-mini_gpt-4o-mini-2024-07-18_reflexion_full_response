Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Vz4B', content='To find the color absorbed, first convert the emission energy to wavelength:\nE = 2.3393 eV;  λ (nm) = 1240 eV·nm / E = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530.2 nm\n530 nm falls in the green–yellow region of the spectrum (often called yellow–green).  Since the nearest option given is “Yellow,” that is the best match.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
