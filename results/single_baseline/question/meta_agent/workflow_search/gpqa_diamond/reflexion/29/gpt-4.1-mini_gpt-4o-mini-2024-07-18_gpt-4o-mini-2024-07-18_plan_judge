Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a color in the blue-green range of the visible spectrum. The absorbed color will be the complementary color of the emitted light. Since blue-green light is emitted, the complementary color that is absorbed would be in the yellow-orange range. Therefore, the correct answer is that the dye absorbs yellow light.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 3
