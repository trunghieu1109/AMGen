Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the color absorbed, first convert the emission energy to wavelength:
E = 2.3393 eV;  λ (nm) = 1240 eV·nm / E = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530.2 nm
530 nm falls in the green–yellow region of the spectrum (often called yellow–green).  Since the nearest option given is “Yellow,” that is the best match.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 3
