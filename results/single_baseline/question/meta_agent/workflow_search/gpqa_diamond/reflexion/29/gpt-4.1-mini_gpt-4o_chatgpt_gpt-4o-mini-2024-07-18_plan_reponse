        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. To find the color of light absorbed, we need to consider the complementary color of the emitted light. The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength in the visible spectrum. Using the formula E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light, we can calculate the wavelength. The wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV is approximately 530 nm, which is in the green region of the spectrum. The complementary color of green is red. Therefore, the color of light absorbed by the compound is red.\n\nAnswer:C)",
