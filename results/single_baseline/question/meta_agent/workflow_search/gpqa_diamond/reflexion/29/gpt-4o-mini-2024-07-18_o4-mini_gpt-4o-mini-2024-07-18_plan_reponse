        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "To find the color absorbed, first convert the emission energy to wavelength:\nE = 2.3393 eV;  \u03bb (nm) = 1240 eV\u00b7nm / E = 1240 / 2.3393 \u2248 530.2 nm\n530 nm falls in the green\u2013yellow region of the spectrum (often called yellow\u2013green).  Since the nearest option given is \u201cYellow,\u201d that is the best match.\n\nAnswer:B)",
