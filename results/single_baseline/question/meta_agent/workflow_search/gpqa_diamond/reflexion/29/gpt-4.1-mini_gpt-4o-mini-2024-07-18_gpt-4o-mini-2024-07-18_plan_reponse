        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a color in the blue-green range of the visible spectrum. The absorbed color will be the complementary color of the emitted light. Since blue-green light is emitted, the complementary color that is absorbed would be in the yellow-orange range. Therefore, the correct answer is that the dye absorbs yellow light.\n\nAnswer:B",
