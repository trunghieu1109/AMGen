        "response": "To find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole, we can use the formula for the entropy of a black hole, which is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula: S = k * A / (4 * l_p^2), where A is the area of the event horizon, k is the Boltzmann constant, and l_p is the Planck length. The area A can be found from the radius of the black hole, which can be estimated from the angular size \u03b8 and the distance d. The angular size \u03b8 = 2 * R / d, where R is the Schwarzschild radius. Solving for R, we get R = \u03b8 * d / 2. The area A = 4 * \u03c0 * R^2. Substituting R = \u03b8 * d / 2 into the area formula, we get A = \u03c0 * (\u03b8 * d)^2. The entropy S is then proportional to A, so S ~ (\u03b8 * d)^2. Substituting \u03b8 = 10^-17 degrees = 10^-17 * (\u03c0/180) radians and d = 10^10 parsecs = 10^10 * 3.086 * 10^16 meters, we can calculate the order of magnitude of S.\n\nAnswer:C)",
