            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",

        "response": "The question involves understanding which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the active chromatin of a shmoo in yeast. The shmoo formation in yeast is related to mating and involves changes in gene expression, which would involve the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex for transcription. The nucleosome histone complex is always present as it is part of the chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not directly related to shmoo formation or active transcription. Therefore, the pre-replication complex is least likely to be observed in this context.\n\nAnswer:B)",
