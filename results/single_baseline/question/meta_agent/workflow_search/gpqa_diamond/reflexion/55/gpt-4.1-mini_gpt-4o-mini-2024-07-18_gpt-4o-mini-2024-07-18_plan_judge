proposed answer: To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions, we need to consider the allowed transitions based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The allowed transitions must change the orbital angular momentum quantum number l by ±1. Therefore, the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0) must go to a state with l=1, which can be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. The second transition must then go from that state to |1,0,0⟩ (l=0). We also need to consider the probabilities given for each transition route. After analyzing the choices, the correct transition route and probability must be identified.

Answer:The transition route and the corresponding probability are |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and \frac{1}{3}.
Extracted answer: The transition route and the corresponding probability are |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and \frac{1}{3}.
