Spontaneous dipole emission from an l=0, m=0 level to l=1, m′ is governed by Clebsch–Gordan coefficients C(0,0;1,q|1,m′), which have equal magnitude for m′=−1,0,+1.  Summing over the three photon polarizations gives equal branching of 1/3 into each m′ channel.  Next, each 2p (l=1, m) decays to 1s (l=0, m=0) with probability |C(1,m;1,−m|0,0)|²=1/3.  Hence the two‐step cascade via any given m has probability (1/3)·(1/3)=1/9.  There are three such routes (m=+1,0,−1).  No single‐route probability in the multiple choices matches 1/9, so one must list all three.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 85KS (yourself):\nThe two–step dipole cascades and their probabilities are\n\n\\[\n|3,0,0\\rangle\\;\\xrightarrow[\\Delta n=-1,\\,\\Delta l=+1]{}\\;|2,1,m\\rangle\\;\\xrightarrow[\\Delta n=-1,\\,\\Delta l=-1]{}\\;|1,0,0\\rangle,\n\\]\nwith\n\n\\[\nP\\bigl(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,m\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle\\bigr)\n=\\frac{1}{3}\\times\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{9},\n\\]\nfor each m=+1,\\;0,\\;−1.  Thus the three possible routes are\n\n1) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,1\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle,\\;P=1/9;\\)\n2) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,0\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle,\\;P=1/9;\\)\n3) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,-1\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle,\\;P=1/9.\\)\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Qv43:\nThe derivation you gave (each two‐step route has P=(1/3)×(1/3)=1/9) is internally consistent for pure dipole branching among the three m sublevels. However, none of the four provided choices lists 1/9, so your answer cannot match any of the given options. In other words, while your calculation of 1/9 per route is correct in isolation, it does not answer the multiple‐choice question as stated.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
