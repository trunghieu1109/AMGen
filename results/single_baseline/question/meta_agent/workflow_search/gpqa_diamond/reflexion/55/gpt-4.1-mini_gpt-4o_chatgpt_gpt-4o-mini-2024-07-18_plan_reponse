        "response": "The initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, which means n=1, l=0, m=0. For a dipole transition, the selection rules are \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. The first transition must go from |3,0,0\u27e9 to a state with n=2, l=1, and m=0, \u00b11. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,1\u27e9, and |2,1,-1\u27e9. The second transition must go from the intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9, which requires \u0394l = -1 and \u0394m = 0. The only intermediate state that satisfies both transitions is |2,1,0\u27e9. The probability for this route is given as 1/3.\n\nAnswer:B)",
