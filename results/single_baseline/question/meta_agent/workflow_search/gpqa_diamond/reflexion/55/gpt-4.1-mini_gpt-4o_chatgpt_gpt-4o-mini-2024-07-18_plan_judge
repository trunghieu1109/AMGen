Question: Example(question='The |3,0,0\\rangle state in the standard notation |n,l,m\\rangle of the H -atom in the non-relativistic theory decays to the state |1,0,0\\rangle via two dipole transition. The transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex),', choice1='|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\nand \\frac{1}{4}', choice2='|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}', choice3='|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}', choice4='\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and \\frac{2}{3}', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which means n=1, l=0, m=0. For a dipole transition, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The first transition must go from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with n=2, l=1, and m=0, ±1. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. The second transition must go from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩, which requires Δl = -1 and Δm = 0. The only intermediate state that satisfies both transitions is |2,1,0⟩. The probability for this route is given as 1/3.
