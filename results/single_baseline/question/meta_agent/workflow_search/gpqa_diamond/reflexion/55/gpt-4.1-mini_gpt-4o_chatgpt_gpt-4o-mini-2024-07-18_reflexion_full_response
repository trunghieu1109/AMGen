Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5KSQ', content='The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which means n=1, l=0, m=0. For a dipole transition, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The first transition must go from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with n=2, l=1, and m=0, ±1. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. The second transition must go from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩, which requires Δl = -1 and Δm = 0. The only intermediate state that satisfies both transitions is |2,1,0⟩. The probability for this route is given as 1/3.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
