Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The scientist is running a qPCR with a calibration curve. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3, which indicates a perfect qPCR reaction. The Ct values should decrease by approximately 3.3 cycles for each ten-fold dilution if the efficiency is 100%. Let's check the Ct values:

- From 100000 to 10000 copies/µl, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 to 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. The difference is about 3.3 cycles.
- From 10000 to 1000 copies/µl, the Ct values are 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 to 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. The difference is about 3.3 cycles.
- From 1000 to 100 copies/µl, the Ct values are 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 to 24, 24.3, 24.6. The difference is about 3.3 cycles.
- From 100 to 10 copies/µl, the Ct values are 24, 24.3, 24.6 to 20.7, 21, 21.3. The difference is about 3.3 cycles.

The Ct values are consistent with the expected decrease of 3.3 cycles per ten-fold dilution, which is expected for 100% efficiency. The deviation between technical replicates is 0.3, which is acceptable. Therefore, the discrepancies are not due to the Ct values not being in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid, nor is it due to the ten-fold dilution being more than 3.3 cycles. The deviation is not more than 0.3 between technical replicates, and qPCR can be used for quantification. Therefore, none of the choices seem to explain a discrepancy, but if we must choose one, the closest is choice 3, as the deviation is exactly 0.3, which is the threshold.
