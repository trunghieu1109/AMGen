Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the discrepancies in the qPCR results, we need to analyze the provided choices in relation to the data. The efficiency of qPCR is 100%, and the slope of -3.3 indicates that a ten-fold dilution corresponds to approximately 3.3 cycles, which is consistent with the expected results. The R2 value of 1 indicates a perfect fit for the calibration curve. The Ct values for the triplicates show some variation, but we need to assess if the deviations are significant. The choice that best explains the discrepancies is the one that addresses the technical replicates' deviations, as they should ideally be close to each other. Therefore, the most relevant choice is that the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates, which indicates a lack of precision in the measurements.
