Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 in spherical coordinates, we can use the divergence theorem. The divergence of a radial field in spherical coordinates can be computed, and since the field falls off as 1/r^2, we expect the divergence to be zero everywhere except at the origin. Therefore, the volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R will yield a result that corresponds to the surface integral over the sphere's surface. The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume. In this case, the divergence of f(r) is zero everywhere except at the origin, leading to a net contribution of zero from the volume integral. Thus, the most appropriate answer for the integral is 0.
