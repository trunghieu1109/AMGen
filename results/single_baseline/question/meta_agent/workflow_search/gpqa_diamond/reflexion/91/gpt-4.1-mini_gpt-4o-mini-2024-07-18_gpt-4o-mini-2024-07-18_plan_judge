Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we need to analyze the structure and count the number of each type of bond present in the molecule. We will then use the provided bond energies to calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule and the energy released when forming the bonds from the elements in their standard states. After performing the calculations, we will compare the result with the provided choices to find the correct answer.

Answer:11200 kJ/mol
Extracted answer: 11200 kJ/mol
Correct answer: 3
