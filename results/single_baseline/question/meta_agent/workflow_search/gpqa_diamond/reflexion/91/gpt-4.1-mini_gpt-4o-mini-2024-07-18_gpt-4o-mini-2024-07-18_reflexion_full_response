We will calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule and then compare it to the energy released when forming the bonds from the elements in their standard states. The enthalpy of formation can be derived from these values. After performing the calculations, we will compare the result with the provided choices.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent bB4u (yourself):\n11200 kJ/mol\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent piFH:\nThe calculation of the enthalpy of formation seems to be based on the bond energies provided, but without detailed breakdown of the bonds in the molecule, it's hard to verify the accuracy. The answer should be checked against the total number of bonds and their respective energies to ensure correctness.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better."}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
