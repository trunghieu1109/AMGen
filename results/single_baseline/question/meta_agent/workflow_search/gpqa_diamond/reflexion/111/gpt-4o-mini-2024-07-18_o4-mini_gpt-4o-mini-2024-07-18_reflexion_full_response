Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2J45', content='We have the unnormalized state |α⟩ = (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2−i)|↓⟩. Its norm² = |1+i|² + |2−i|² = 2 + 5 = 7, so |α⟩ = (1/√7)[(1+i)|↑⟩ + (2−i)|↓⟩]. The operator A has matrix (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] = (ħ/2)σ_x, with eigenstates |±⟩ = (|↑⟩ ± |↓⟩)/√2. Compute ⟨+|α⟩ = (1/√2√7)[(1+i)+(2−i)] = 3/√14 ⇒ P₊ = 9/14 ≈ 0.64. ⟨−|α⟩ = (1/√14)(−1+2i) ⇒ P₋ = 5/14 ≈ 0.36. The expectation ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨σ_x⟩ = (ħ/2)(P₊−P₋) = (ħ/2)(4/14) = ħ/7.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
