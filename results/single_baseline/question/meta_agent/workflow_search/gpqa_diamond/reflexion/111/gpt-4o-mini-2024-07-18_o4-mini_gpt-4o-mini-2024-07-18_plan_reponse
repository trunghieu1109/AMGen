Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. ",

Its norm\u00b2 = |1+i|\u00b2 + |2\u2212i|\u00b2 = 2 + 5 = 7, so |\u03b1\u27e9 = (1/\u221a7)[(1+i)|\u2191\u27e9 + (2\u2212i)|\u2193\u27e9]. The operator A has matrix (\u0127/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] = (\u0127/2)\u03c3_x, with eigenstates |\u00b1\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 \u00b1 |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2. Compute \u27e8+|\u03b1\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2\u221a7)[(1+i)+(2\u2212i)] = 3/\u221a14 \u21d2 P\u208a = 9/14 \u2248 0.64. \u27e8\u2212|\u03b1\u27e9 = (1/\u221a14)(\u22121+2i) \u21d2 P\u208b = 5/14 \u2248 0.36. The expectation \u27e8A\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)(P\u208a\u2212P\u208b) = (\u0127/2)(4/14) = \u0127/7.\n\nAnswer:D)",
