    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7k55 (yourself):
The given state is |l1, l2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. This is a coupled angular momentum state where l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2, and m = -1. We want to find the probability of measuring L1z = -침 and L2z = -침. In the uncoupled basis, the possible values of m1 and m2 (the z-components of the individual angular momenta) are -1, 0, and 1. The condition m1 + m2 = m = -1 must be satisfied. The possible pairs (m1, m2) that satisfy this are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). We are interested in the pair (-1, -1). The state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; can be expressed in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m1, m2&gt; using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coefficient for the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; in terms of |1, -1&gt; is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(1, 1, 2, -1; -1, -1). This coefficient is 1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this coefficient, which is 1/3.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7k55 (yourself):
0

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent N6p2:
The reasoning provided is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the final answer. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; in terms of |1, -1&gt; is indeed 1/sqrt(3), but the probability is the square of this coefficient, which is 1/3, not 0.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
