    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5N6p (yourself):
In the given state |1,1,2,-1&gt;, the quantum numbers indicate that both electrons are in the p orbital (l=1). The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron in the p orbital are -ħ, 0, and +ħ. For both electrons to have L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ, we need to consider the coupling of their states. The total m value of -1 suggests that one electron must be in the m = -1 state and the other must be in the m = 0 state, or both must be in the m = -1 state. However, since we are looking for the probability of both being -ħ, we need to check the allowed combinations. The only way to achieve both L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ is if both electrons are in the m = -1 state. The probability of this occurring in the coupled state is determined by the normalization of the states. Since there are 3 possible m values (-1, 0, +1) for each electron, the probability of both being in the -1 state is 1/3 for each electron, leading to a joint probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. However, since we are looking for the joint probability of both being -ħ, we need to consider the normalization of the total state. The correct answer is that the joint probability of getting both eigenvalues as -ħ is 0, as there is no valid configuration that allows both electrons to be in the -1 state simultaneously while maintaining the total m value of -1.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5N6p (yourself):
3

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 2VLf:
The reasoning provided indicates that both electrons cannot simultaneously have L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ while maintaining the total m value of -1. Therefore, the joint probability of both being -ħ is indeed 0, as there is no valid configuration that allows this. The answer given as 3 is incorrect.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>In the state |1,1,2,-1&gt;, both electrons are in the p orbital, which means they can have m values of -1, 0, or +1. For both electrons to have L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ, they must both be in the m = -1 state. However, the total m value of the system is -1, which means that if both electrons were in the m = -1 state, the total m would be -2, not -1. Therefore, it is impossible for both electrons to have L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ simultaneously while maintaining the total m value of -1. Thus, the joint probability of getting both eigenvalues as -ħ is 0.
