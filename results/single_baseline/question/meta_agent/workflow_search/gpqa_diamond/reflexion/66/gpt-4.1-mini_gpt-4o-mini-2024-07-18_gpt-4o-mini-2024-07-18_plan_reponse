            "Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n",

        "response": "In the state |1,1,2,-1>, both electrons are in the p orbital, which means they can have m values of -1, 0, or +1. For both electrons to have L_{1z} = -\u0127 and L_{2z} = -\u0127, they must both be in the m = -1 state. However, the total m value of the system is -1, which means that if both electrons were in the m = -1 state, the total m would be -2, not -1. Therefore, it is impossible for both electrons to have L_{1z} = -\u0127 and L_{2z} = -\u0127 simultaneously while maintaining the total m value of -1. Thus, the joint probability of getting both eigenvalues as -\u0127 is 0.\n\nAnswer:0",
