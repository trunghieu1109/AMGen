Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We expand the coupled state |1,1;2,−1⟩ in the uncoupled basis |m1,m2⟩. The only terms with m1+m2=−1 are |0,−1⟩ and |−1,0⟩, each with Clebsch–Gordan coefficient 1/√2. There is no component |−1,−1⟩ (which would give m=−2). Hence the amplitude for m1=−1 and m2=−1 is zero and so is the probability.
