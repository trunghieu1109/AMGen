            "Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n",

        "response": "We expand the coupled state |1,1;2,\u22121\u27e9 in the uncoupled basis |m1,m2\u27e9. The only terms with m1+m2=\u22121 are |0,\u22121\u27e9 and |\u22121,0\u27e9, each with Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficient 1/\u221a2. There is no component |\u22121,\u22121\u27e9 (which would give m=\u22122). Hence the amplitude for m1=\u22121 and m2=\u22121 is zero and so is the probability.\n\nAnswer:C)",
