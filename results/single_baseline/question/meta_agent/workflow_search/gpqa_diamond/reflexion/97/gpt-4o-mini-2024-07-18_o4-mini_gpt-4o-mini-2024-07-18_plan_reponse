        "response": "We need A such that cross\u2010metathesis with propene and a methylideneruthenium species gives 1\u2010(prop\u20101\u2010en\u20101\u2010yl)\u20102\u2010vinylcyclopentane. That product has two substituents on a cyclopentane ring: one prop\u20101\u2010en\u20101\u2010yl (from propene cross\u2010metathesis) and one vinyl (from cross with Ru=CH2 methylidene). Thus A must be cyclopentane with two exocyclic methylene groups (one at C1, one at C2), i.e. 1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane. That's choice 3, corresponding to C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
