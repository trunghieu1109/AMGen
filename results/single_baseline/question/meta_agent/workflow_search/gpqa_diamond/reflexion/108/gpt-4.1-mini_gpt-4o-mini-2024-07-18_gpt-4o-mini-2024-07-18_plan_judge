Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to analyze the conservation of isospin, angular momentum, and parity. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy the Pauli statistics condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, we need to find the combinations of S(NN) and L(NN) that satisfy this condition. We will also consider the parity of the final state, which is affected by the intrinsic parity of particle X and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. We will evaluate each choice to see if it violates any of these conservation laws. After careful consideration, the choice that does not satisfy the conditions is 1S0 -> 3D3 + f, as it does not comply with the required parity and angular momentum conservation rules.
