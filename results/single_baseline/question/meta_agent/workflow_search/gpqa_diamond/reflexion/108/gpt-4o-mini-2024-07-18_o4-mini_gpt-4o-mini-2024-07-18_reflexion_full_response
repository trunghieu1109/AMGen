Question: {'question': 'Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gCKp', content='Initial state: NN in 1S0 has J=0, L=0, S=0, parity +. Final NN in 2S+1L(J) plus emitted X with intrinsic parity –1 and orbital l_x. Conservation: J_final=0 requires J_NN = l_x. Parity requires (–1)^{L_NN}×(–1)×(–1)^{l_x} = +1 ⇒ L_NN + l_x +1 even. Pauli for final T=0: S + L_NN +1 even ⇒ S + L_NN odd. Check each choice:\nA) 3P0 + s: S=1, L_NN=1, J_NN=0 matches l_x=0; parity ok; but S+L_NN=2 even violates Pauli ⇒ forbidden.\nB) 3D1 + p: S+L_NN=3 odd, parity ok, J-coupling ok ⇒ allowed.\nC) 3D3 + f: S+L_NN=3 odd, parity ok, J-coupling ok ⇒ allowed.\nD) 3S1 + p: S+L_NN=1 odd, parity ok, J-coupling ok ⇒ allowed.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
