Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Initial state: NN in 1S0 has J=0, L=0, S=0, parity +. Final NN in 2S+1L(J) plus emitted X with intrinsic parity –1 and orbital l_x. Conservation: J_final=0 requires J_NN = l_x. Parity requires (–1)^{L_NN}×(–1)×(–1)^{l_x} = +1 ⇒ L_NN + l_x +1 even. Pauli for final T=0: S + L_NN +1 even ⇒ S + L_NN odd. Check each choice:
A) 3P0 + s: S=1, L_NN=1, J_NN=0 matches l_x=0; parity ok; but S+L_NN=2 even violates Pauli ⇒ forbidden.
B) 3D1 + p: S+L_NN=3 odd, parity ok, J-coupling ok ⇒ allowed.
C) 3D3 + f: S+L_NN=3 odd, parity ok, J-coupling ok ⇒ allowed.
D) 3S1 + p: S+L_NN=1 odd, parity ok, J-coupling ok ⇒ allowed.
