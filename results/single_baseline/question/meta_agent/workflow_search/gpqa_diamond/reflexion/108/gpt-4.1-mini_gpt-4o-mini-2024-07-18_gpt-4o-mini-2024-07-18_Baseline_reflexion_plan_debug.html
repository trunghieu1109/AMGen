    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent EW5I (yourself):
To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to analyze the conservation of isospin, angular momentum, and parity. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy the Pauli statistics condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, we need to find the combinations of S(NN) and L(NN) that satisfy this condition. We will also consider the parity of the final state, which is affected by the intrinsic parity of particle X and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. We will evaluate each choice to see if it violates any of these conservation laws.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent EW5I (yourself):
1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Ze15:
The analysis of the final NN state and the conservation laws seems to be correct, but the choice of 3D3 + f may not be the only option that violates the conditions. It&#39;s important to check all choices against the conservation of isospin, angular momentum, and parity more thoroughly.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
