    <pre>We start with a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state, which means the initial state has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The intrinsic parity of the initial state is positive, as it is a bound state of two nucleons. The particle X emitted has intrinsic parity -1. We need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity in the final state. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, which means the isospin is 0. According to Pauli statistics, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). For T(NN) = 0, we have S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 (mod 2). This means S(NN) and L(NN) must have opposite parities. We also need to consider the parity of the final state. The parity of the final state is given by (-1)^(L(NN) + l), where l is the angular momentum of the emitted particle X. The initial parity is positive, and the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1, so the final parity must be negative. Therefore, (-1)^(L(NN) + l) * (-1) = -1, which simplifies to (-1)^(L(NN) + l) = 1, meaning L(NN) + l must be even. Now, let&#39;s analyze each choice: 1) 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 1, l = 0. S(NN) + L(NN) = 2, which is even, not satisfying the Pauli condition. 2) 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: Here, S(NN) = 3, L(NN) = 2, l = 1. S(NN) + L(NN) = 5, which is odd, satisfying the Pauli condition. L(NN) + l = 3, which is odd, not satisfying the parity condition. 3) 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 2, l = 3. S(NN) + L(NN) = 3, which is odd, satisfying the Pauli condition. L(NN) + l = 5, which is odd, not satisfying the parity condition. 4) 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 0, l = 1. S(NN) + L(NN) = 1, which is odd, satisfying the Pauli condition. L(NN) + l = 1, which is odd, not satisfying the parity condition. The choice that does not satisfy the Pauli condition is 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s.
