            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",
            "The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.",
            "The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.",

        "response": "In the original decay, the continuous energy spectrum of the E particles is due to the neutrinos (V) sharing energy with them. In the variant decay, the massless particle M can also take a range of energies, allowing the spectrum to remain continuous. However, since M is a single particle, it can potentially take more energy than the two neutrinos combined, which would decrease the maximum energy available to the E particles, thus decreasing the endpoint.\n\nAnswer:B)",
