            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",

        "response": "In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E. When one massless particle M is emitted instead of the two particles V, the energy available for the outgoing particles E changes. Since M is massless, it allows for a different distribution of energy among the outgoing particles E. The total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles will still be continuous, but the shape will be adjusted due to the change in the number of emitted particles and their properties. The endpoint of the spectrum is likely to decrease because the energy that was previously shared with the two V particles is now only partially shared with the massless particle M. Therefore, the correct choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.\n\nAnswer:choice2",
