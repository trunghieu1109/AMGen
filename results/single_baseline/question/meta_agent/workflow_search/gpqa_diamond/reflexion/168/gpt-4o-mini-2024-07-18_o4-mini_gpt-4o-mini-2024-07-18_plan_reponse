            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",
            "The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.",
            "The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.",

        "response": "With only one massless particle M the decay is still a three-body final state (2E+M), so the sum-energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous. The total available energy Q is fixed by the nuclear mass difference, and because M can carry away zero energy (being massless), the maximum sum energy of the E\u2019s still reaches Q. None of the provided choices exactly states \u201ccontinuous with endpoint unchanged,\u201d so the closest match among them (continuous spectrum with an endpoint not higher than Q) is choice B.\n\nAnswer:B",
