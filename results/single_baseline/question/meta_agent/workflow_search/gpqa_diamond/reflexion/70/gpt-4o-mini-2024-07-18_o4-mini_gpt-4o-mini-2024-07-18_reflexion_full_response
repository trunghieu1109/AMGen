Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', 'choice1': '~0.75', 'choice2': '~0.83', 'choice3': '~0.69', 'choice4': '~0.57'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent valg', content='The equilibrium temperature for a planet in a circular orbit with the same albedo scales as T_eq ∝ a^(−1/2). From Kepler’s third law (for a fixed stellar mass), a ∝ P^(2/3), so T_eq ∝ P^(−1/3). For Planet_2, P2=2; for Planet_4, P4=3.5 (in units where Planet_1’s period=1). Thus T4/T2=(P2/P4)^(1/3)=(2/3.5)^(1/3)≈0.83.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
