Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The equilibrium temperature for a planet in a circular orbit with the same albedo scales as T_eq ∝ a^(−1/2). From Kepler’s third law (for a fixed stellar mass), a ∝ P^(2/3), so T_eq ∝ P^(−1/3). For Planet_2, P2=2; for Planet_4, P4=3.5 (in units where Planet_1’s period=1). Thus T4/T2=(P2/P4)^(1/3)=(2/3.5)^(1/3)≈0.83.
