            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

        "response": "The equilibrium temperature for a planet in a circular orbit with the same albedo scales as T_eq \u221d a^(\u22121/2). From Kepler\u2019s third law (for a fixed stellar mass), a \u221d P^(2/3), so T_eq \u221d P^(\u22121/3). For Planet_2, P2=2; for Planet_4, P4=3.5 (in units where Planet_1\u2019s period=1). Thus T4/T2=(P2/P4)^(1/3)=(2/3.5)^(1/3)\u22480.83.\n\nAnswer:B)",
