    <pre>To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which is proportional to the square root of the inverse of the orbital period. The periods of the planets are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, we can denote the periods as P1 = 1, P2 = 2, P3 = 2.5, P4 = 3.5, and P5 = 5. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/P)^(1/4). Thus, the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 can be calculated as follows: T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/4). Substituting the periods, we have T4/T2 = (2/3.5)^(1/4). Calculating this gives us the ratio of the temperatures. After performing the calculation, we find that the ratio is approximately 0.75. Therefore, the closest choice is ~0.75.
