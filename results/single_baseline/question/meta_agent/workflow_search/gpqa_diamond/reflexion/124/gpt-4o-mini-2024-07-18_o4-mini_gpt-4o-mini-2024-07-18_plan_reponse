            "Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke\u2019s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?",

The ground state is N=0: E_0 = (3/2)\u0127\u03c9, first excited N=1: (5/2)\u0127\u03c9, second N=2: (7/2)\u0127\u03c9, third excited N=3: (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. The degeneracy g for level N is (N+1)(N+2)/2. For N=3: g = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = 4*5/2 = 10.\n\nAnswer:A)",
