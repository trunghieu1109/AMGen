proposed answer: The problem describes a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) \hbar \omega, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to n = 0, the first excited state to n = 1, the second excited state to n = 2, and the third excited state to n = 3. For n = 3, the energy is E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \hbar \omega = (9/2) \hbar \omega. The degeneracy of the energy level is given by the number of ways to partition n into three non-negative integers, which is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, the degeneracy is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) \hbar \omega and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.
