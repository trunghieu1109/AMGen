            "Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke\u2019s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?",

        "response": "The problem describes a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to n = 0, the first excited state to n = 1, the second excited state to n = 2, and the third excited state to n = 3. For n = 3, the energy is E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. The degeneracy of the energy level is given by the number of ways to partition n into three non-negative integers, which is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, the degeneracy is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) \\hbar \\omega and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nAnswer:A)",
