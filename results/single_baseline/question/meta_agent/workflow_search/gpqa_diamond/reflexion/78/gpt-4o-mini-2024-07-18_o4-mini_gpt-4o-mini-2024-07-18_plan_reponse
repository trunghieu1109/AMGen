            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "The product NMR shows two methyl singlets (\u03b4 2.28 and 2.31), a para-disubstituted aromatic pattern (4H as two doublets), two vinyl protons (1H each, doublets), and a carbonyl at \u03b4 197.7. This corresponds to CH3CO\u2013CH=CH\u2013C6H4\u2013Me (para-methyl), an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone (p-methylchalcone). A Meinwald rearrangement of an epoxide bearing a para-methylstyryl substituent and a CH2 at the other epoxide carbon yields exactly CH3CO\u2013CH=CH\u2013C6H4\u2013Me. Among the choices, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane has a para-methylphenylvinyl substituent on the epoxide and a CH2 that becomes the acetyl methyl, thus giving the observed product.\n\nAnswer:B)",
