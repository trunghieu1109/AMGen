            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "To identify Compound X (C11H12O), I will analyze the provided NMR data more carefully. The 1H NMR shows signals for two distinct methyl groups (3H, s) and several aromatic protons with different splitting patterns, indicating a substituted aromatic compound. The 13C NMR confirms the presence of aromatic carbons and suggests a structure with an epoxide due to the presence of oxygen. I will compare the molecular formula and the NMR data with the given choices to find the best match, paying close attention to the integration and splitting patterns.\n\nAnswer:choice4",
