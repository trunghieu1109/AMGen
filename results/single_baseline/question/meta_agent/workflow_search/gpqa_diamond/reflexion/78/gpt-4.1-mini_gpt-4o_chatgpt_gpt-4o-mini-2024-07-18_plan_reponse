            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "To identify Compound X, we need to analyze the given NMR data and match it with the possible structures. The 1H NMR shows signals for two singlets at \u03b4 2.28 and 2.31, which could correspond to methyl groups. The aromatic region shows signals at \u03b4 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71, indicating a substituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR shows signals at \u03b4 21.3 and 28.4, likely corresponding to the methyl carbons. The signals at \u03b4 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3 are typical for aromatic carbons. The signal at \u03b4 197.7 suggests a carbonyl group, but since the molecular formula is C11H12O, it is more likely an epoxide carbon. The structure that fits these data is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which has the correct number of carbons and hydrogens, and the NMR signals match the expected pattern for this compound.\n\nAnswer:B)",
