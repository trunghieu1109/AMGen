Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle is the signal recognition particle (SRP) that binds the nascent chain at the ribosome in the cytosol, pauses translation, and targets it to the rough ER where glycosylation (sugar addition) occurs. The chain is ultimately secreted extracellularly.
