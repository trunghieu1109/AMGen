Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ and then use it to find the total energy E. The Lorentz factor γ is calculated as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). With v = 0.96c, we can compute γ. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons is approximately 7.5 atomic mass units (u), which we convert to energy using E = mc². After calculating the energy, we will compare it to the provided choices to find the closest match.
