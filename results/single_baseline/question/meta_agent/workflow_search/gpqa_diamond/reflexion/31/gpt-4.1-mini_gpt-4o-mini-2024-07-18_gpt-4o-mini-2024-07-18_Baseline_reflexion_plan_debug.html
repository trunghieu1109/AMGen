### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent IrHm (yourself):
To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ can be calculated using the formula γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Given that v = 0.96c, we can calculate γ and then find the energy based on the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons is approximately 7.5 atomic mass units (u), and we can convert this to energy using E = mc². After calculating the energy, we can compare it to the provided choices to find the closest match.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent IrHm (yourself):
20.132 GeV

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent sBLH:
The calculation of the energy using the relativistic formula seems to be correct, but the choice of 20.132 GeV should be verified against the actual calculations of the rest mass energy and the Lorentz factor. The rest mass of the lithium nucleus and the conversion to energy must be accurate to ensure the correct answer is chosen.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
