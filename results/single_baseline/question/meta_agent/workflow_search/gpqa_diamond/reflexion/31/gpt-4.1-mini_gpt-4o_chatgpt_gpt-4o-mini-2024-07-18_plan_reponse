        "response": "To find the energy of the lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we first calculate the rest mass energy. The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), and 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2. Therefore, the rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). We then calculate the total energy E = \u03b3 * rest mass energy. Finally, we compare this calculated energy with the given choices to find the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:21.419",
