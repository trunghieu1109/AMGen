Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the required energy E for a Li-6 nucleus (3 protons + 3 neutrons) moving at v = 0.96 c, we compute γ = 1/√(1–β²) = 1/√(1–0.96²) = 3.5714286. The nuclear mass is the atomic mass of 6Li (6.0151228 u) minus 3 electron masses (3×0.00054858 u) = 6.013477 u. Converting to energy: m₀c² = 6.013477 u × 931.494 MeV/u = 5601.53 MeV. Thus E = γ m₀c² = 3.5714286 × 5601.53 MeV = 20005.1 MeV = 20.0051 GeV. None of the provided options matches this at the 1e-4 precision required.
