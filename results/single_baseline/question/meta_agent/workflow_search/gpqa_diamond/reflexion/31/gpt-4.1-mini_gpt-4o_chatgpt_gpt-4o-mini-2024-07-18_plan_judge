Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the energy of the lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we first calculate the rest mass energy. The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), and 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2. Therefore, the rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV. The Lorentz factor γ is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). We then calculate the total energy E = γ * rest mass energy. Finally, we compare this calculated energy with the given choices to find the correct answer.
