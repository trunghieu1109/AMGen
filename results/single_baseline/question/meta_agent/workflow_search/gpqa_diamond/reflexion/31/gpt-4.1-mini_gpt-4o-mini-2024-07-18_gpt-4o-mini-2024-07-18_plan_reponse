        "response": "To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3 and then use it to find the total energy E. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 is calculated as \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). With v = 0.96c, we can compute \u03b3. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons is approximately 7.5 atomic mass units (u), which we convert to energy using E = mc\u00b2. After calculating the energy, we will compare it to the provided choices to find the closest match.\n\nAnswer:B",
