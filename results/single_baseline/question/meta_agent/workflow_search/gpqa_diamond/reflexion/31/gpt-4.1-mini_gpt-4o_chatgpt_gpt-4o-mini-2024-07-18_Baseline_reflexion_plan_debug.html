### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent rHms (yourself):
To find the energy of the nucleus X (which is lithium with 3 neutrons, so it is lithium-6), we need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The speed of the nucleus is given as 0.96c. The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), where 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2. First, calculate the rest mass energy of lithium-6. Then, use the relativistic formula for energy: E = γmc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Calculate γ for v = 0.96c, and then find the total energy E. Compare the calculated energy with the given choices.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent BLHq:
The calculation involves finding the relativistic energy of a lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c. The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 u, and 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2. The Lorentz factor γ is calculated as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). The total energy E is then γ times the rest mass energy. The correct choice should be verified by calculating this energy and comparing it to the given options.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), and 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c^2. Therefore, the rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV. The Lorentz factor γ is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). We then calculate the total energy E = γ * rest mass energy. Finally, we compare this calculated energy with the given choices to find the correct answer.
