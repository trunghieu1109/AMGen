    <pre>The problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that decomposes to form gases. The gases are passed through three tubes: Tube 1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, Tube 2 with Ca(OH)2 solution, and Tube 3 with red-hot copper. The increase in mass of Tube 1 indicates water absorption, and the increase in mass of Tube 3 indicates the formation of CuO, suggesting the presence of oxygen. The unchanged mass of Tube 2 suggests no CO2 was absorbed, meaning no CO2 was produced. The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, which is 0.1 moles. The increase in mass of Tube 1 by 3.60 g corresponds to 0.2 moles of water (since 18 g/mol is the molar mass of water). The increase in mass of Tube 3 by 0.80 g corresponds to 0.05 moles of oxygen (since 16 g/mol is the molar mass of O). The total moles of gas produced is 0.1 moles of gas C, 0.2 moles of water, and 0.05 moles of oxygen, which suggests the decomposition of salts A and B produced these gases. Since the mixture is equimolar, we consider the simplest case where each salt contributes to the formation of these gases. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be deduced from the stoichiometry of the decomposition reactions and the moles of gases produced.
