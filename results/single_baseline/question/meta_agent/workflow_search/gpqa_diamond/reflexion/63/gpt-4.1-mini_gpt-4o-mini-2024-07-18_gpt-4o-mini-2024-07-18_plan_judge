Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the total number of atoms in salts A and B, we need to analyze the information provided. The mixture weighs 7.20 g and is equimolar, meaning the moles of A and B are equal. The weight changes in the tubes indicate reactions occurred with gases produced. Tube 1 absorbed gas, likely water vapor or another gas, while tube 3 formed CuO, indicating a reaction with a gas containing oxygen. The weight of tube 2 did not change, suggesting no reaction occurred with that gas. The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles of gas. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be estimated based on typical salts that could fit the description. Common salts that could be equimolar and fit the weight could be NaCl and KCl, which would give a total of 15 atoms (Na: 1, Cl: 1, K: 1, Cl: 1). Therefore, the most reasonable estimate is 15 atoms, corresponding to choice 1.
