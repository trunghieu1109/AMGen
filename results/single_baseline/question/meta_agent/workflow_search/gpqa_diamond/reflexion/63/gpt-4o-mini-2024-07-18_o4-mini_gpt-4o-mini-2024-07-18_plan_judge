Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let salts be A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃. Molar masses: 64 and 80, equimolar n each satisfy 64n + 80n = 7.20 ⇒ n = 0.05. 
Decompositions:
NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O: from 0.05 mol gives 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.
NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 2H₂O + ½O₂: from 0.05 mol gives 0.05 mol N₂, 0.10 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂.
Total H₂O = 0.20 mol → 3.60 g; O₂ = 0.025 mol → O uptake = 0.80 g; N₂ = 0.10 mol → 2.24 L. Matches data. 
Atoms per formula: NH₄NO₂ has 2N+4H+2O = 8 atoms; NH₄NO₃ has 2N+4H+3O = 9 atoms; total = 17 atoms.
