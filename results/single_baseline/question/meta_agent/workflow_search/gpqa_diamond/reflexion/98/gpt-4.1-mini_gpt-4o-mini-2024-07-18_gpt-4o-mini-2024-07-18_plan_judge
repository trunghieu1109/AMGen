Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid due to the broad peak at 3000 wavenumbers and a strong peak at 1700 wavenumbers. The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns, which suggest a complicated hydrogen environment. The absence of vinyl hydrogens indicates no double bonds. Analyzing the provided options, I need to match the splitting patterns and the presence of functional groups to the correct structure. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (choice 2) has a simpler structure that could correspond to the observed NMR patterns better than the more complex structures. Therefore, I will choose choice 2 as the most likely candidate.
