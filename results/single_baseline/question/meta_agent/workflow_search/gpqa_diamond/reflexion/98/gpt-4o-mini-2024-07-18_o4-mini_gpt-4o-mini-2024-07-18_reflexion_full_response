Question: {'question': 'You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', 'choice1': 'CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', 'choice2': 'CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', 'choice3': 'CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', 'choice4': 'CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH'}\Pattern: reflexion
