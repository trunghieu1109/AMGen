Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zrGJ', content='For decay π+ (at rest) → μ+ + ν, use two-body kinematics: \nE_μ = (m_π^2 + m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≈ 109.8 MeV, so KE_μ = E_μ – m_μ = 109.8 – 105.7 ≈ 4.1 MeV.  \nE_ν = (m_π^2 – m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) = (139.6^2 – 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≈ 29.8 MeV, which is essentially the neutrino kinetic energy.  \nComparing to choices gives KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV and KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV (choice 4).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
