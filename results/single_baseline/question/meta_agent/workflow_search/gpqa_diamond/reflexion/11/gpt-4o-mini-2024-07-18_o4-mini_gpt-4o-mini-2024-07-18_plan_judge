Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: For decay π+ (at rest) → μ+ + ν, use two-body kinematics: 
E_μ = (m_π^2 + m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≈ 109.8 MeV, so KE_μ = E_μ – m_μ = 109.8 – 105.7 ≈ 4.1 MeV.  
E_ν = (m_π^2 – m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) = (139.6^2 – 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≈ 29.8 MeV, which is essentially the neutrino kinetic energy.  
Comparing to choices gives KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV and KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV (choice 4).
