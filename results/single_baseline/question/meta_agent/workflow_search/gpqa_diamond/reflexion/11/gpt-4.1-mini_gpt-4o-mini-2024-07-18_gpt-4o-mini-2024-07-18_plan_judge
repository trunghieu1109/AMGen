Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu, we start with the conservation of energy. The rest mass energy of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass energy of mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is considered massless. The total energy before the decay is 139.6 MeV, and after the decay, it is the rest mass energy of mu(+) plus the kinetic energy of mu(+) and the neutrino. The kinetic energy of the muon can be calculated as KE(mu) = Total energy - Rest mass energy of mu(+) = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. Since the neutrino has negligible mass, its kinetic energy can be considered as part of the energy balance. We need to find the correct choice that matches the calculated kinetic energies based on this analysis.
