Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eOCo', content='To determine the major products of the given reactions, we need to analyze the provided choices for both reactions A and B. The Cope rearrangement typically involves the rearrangement of diene systems, and the products should reflect the expected structural changes.
