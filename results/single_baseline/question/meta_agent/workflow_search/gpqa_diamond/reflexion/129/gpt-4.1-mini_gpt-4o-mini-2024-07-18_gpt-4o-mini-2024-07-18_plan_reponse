        "response": "To detect the Lyman alpha emission at ~1216 Angstroms from neutral hydrogen clouds, we need to consider the redshift (z) that would shift this wavelength into the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. The Lyman alpha line is redshifted according to the formula: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). We want to find the minimum z such that the observed wavelength falls within the optical range. The optical range typically starts around 4000 Angstroms. Setting up the equation: 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z), we can solve for z. Rearranging gives us (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216, which simplifies to z = (4000 / 1216) - 1. Calculating this gives us z \u2248 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for detection is approximately 2.29, which means we should choose the closest option that is greater than or equal to this value.\n\nAnswer:2.4",
