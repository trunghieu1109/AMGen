Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ZPNK', content='The Lyman alpha line at 1216 Å must be redshifted into the optical window (>~3000 Å) of ground-based telescopes. Taking a typical atmospheric cutoff around 3000–3500 Å gives a minimum redshift z_min ≃ (λ_obs/λ_rest) – 1 ≃ (3500/1216) – 1 ≃ 1.88. The closest choice is 1.9.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
