    <pre>To detect the Lyman alpha emission at ~1216 Angstroms from neutral hydrogen clouds, we need to consider the redshift (z) that would shift this wavelength into the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. The Lyman alpha line is redshifted according to the formula: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). We want to find the minimum z such that the observed wavelength falls within the optical range. The optical range typically starts around 4000 Angstroms. Setting up the equation: 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z), we can solve for z. Rearranging gives us (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216, which simplifies to z = (4000 / 1216) - 1. Calculating this gives us z â‰ˆ 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for detection is approximately 2.29, which means we should choose the closest option that is greater than or equal to this value.
