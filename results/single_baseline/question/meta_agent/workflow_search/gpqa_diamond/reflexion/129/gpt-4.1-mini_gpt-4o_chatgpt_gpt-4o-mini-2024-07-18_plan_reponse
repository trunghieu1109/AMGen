        "response": "To detect the Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the range of wavelengths that optical telescopes can observe. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 4000 Angstroms (blue) to 7000 Angstroms (red). The redshift z is given by the formula: observed wavelength = (1 + z) * rest wavelength. We want the observed wavelength to be within the optical range, so we set the lower limit of the observed wavelength to 4000 Angstroms. Solving for z, we have 4000 = (1 + z) * 1216, which gives z = (4000/1216) - 1. Calculating this gives z \u2248 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for detection with optical telescopes is approximately 2.29, which corresponds to choice 2.4 as the closest option.\n\nAnswer:B)",
