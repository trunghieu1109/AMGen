Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The Lyman alpha line at 1216 Å must be redshifted into the optical window (>~3000 Å) of ground-based telescopes. Taking a typical atmospheric cutoff around 3000–3500 Å gives a minimum redshift z_min ≃ (λ_obs/λ_rest) – 1 ≃ (3500/1216) – 1 ≃ 1.88. The closest choice is 1.9.
