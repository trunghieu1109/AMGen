Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent l7Eg', content='We have a supernova ejecta moving relative to the Galaxy at v = 60 000 km/s = 0.2c. The proper time in the ejecta frame is τ = 50 s. The time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is dilated: t = γ\u2009τ with γ = 1/√(1–β²) and β = 0.2, so γ ≈ 1.02062. Thus t ≈ 1.02062 × 50 s ≈ 51.031 s. The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is d = v\u2009t ≈ 60 000 km/s × 51.031 s ≈ 3 061 860 km ≈ 3 060 000 km.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
