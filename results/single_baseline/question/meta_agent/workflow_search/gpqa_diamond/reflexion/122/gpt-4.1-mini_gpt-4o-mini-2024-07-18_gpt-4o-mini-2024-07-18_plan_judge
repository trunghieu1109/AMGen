Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame, we need to consider the relative motion. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s. In the ejecta's reference frame, it perceives the Galaxy's center moving towards it at this speed. Therefore, in the Galaxy's reference frame, the ejecta is also moving towards the center of the Galaxy at the same speed. The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed Ã— time. Here, the speed is 60,000 km/s and the time is 50 seconds. Thus, the distance traveled is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.
