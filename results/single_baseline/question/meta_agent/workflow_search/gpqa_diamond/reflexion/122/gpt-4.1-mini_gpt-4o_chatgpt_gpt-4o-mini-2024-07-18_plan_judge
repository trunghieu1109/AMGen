Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of special relativity since the speed involved (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c = 300,000 km/s). We are given that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. We need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's reference frame and then calculate the distance traveled in that frame.

First, we calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) using the formula: 

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2),

where v = 60,000 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2.

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0204.

The time dilation formula tells us that the time in the Galaxy's frame (t') is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t) by:

t' = gamma * t.

Given t = 50 seconds, we find:

t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Now, we calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame using the speed and the time in the Galaxy's frame:

Distance = speed * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 3,061,200 km.

The closest choice to this calculated distance is 3,060,000 km.
