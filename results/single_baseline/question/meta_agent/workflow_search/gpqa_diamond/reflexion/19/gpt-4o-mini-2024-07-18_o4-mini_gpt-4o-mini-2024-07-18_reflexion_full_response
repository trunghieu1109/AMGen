Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='We want the impulse approximation, where the interaction acts as if on a free nucleon. That requires (1) the current couples only to individual nucleons, (2) no final-state interactions (nucleus transparent), and (4) the nucleon experiences no binding forces during interaction. Assumption 3 (non-relativistic quarks) is not needed for the impulse approximation at the nucleon level. Thus the needed set is 1,2,4, which corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
