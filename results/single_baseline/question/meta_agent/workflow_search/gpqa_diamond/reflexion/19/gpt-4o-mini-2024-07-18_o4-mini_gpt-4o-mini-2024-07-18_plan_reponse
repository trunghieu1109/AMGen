            "A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this \"\"impulse\"\" approximation?\n\n1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.",

        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "We want the impulse approximation, where the interaction acts as if on a free nucleon. That requires (1) the current couples only to individual nucleons, (2) no final-state interactions (nucleus transparent), and (4) the nucleon experiences no binding forces during interaction. Assumption 3 (non-relativistic quarks) is not needed for the impulse approximation at the nucleon level. Thus the needed set is 1,2,4, which corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
