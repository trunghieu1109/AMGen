        "response": "To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \\Delta E of the Hydrogen atom, we first calculate \\Delta E using the formula \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}. With \\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} m, we can find \\Delta E. The paramagnetic coupling term is related to the magnetic field B and the magnetic moment, which can be estimated for an electron in a hydrogen atom. After calculating both values, we can determine the relationship between \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle and \\Delta E. The calculations will show that the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy, leading to the conclusion that \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E.\n\nAnswer:A",
