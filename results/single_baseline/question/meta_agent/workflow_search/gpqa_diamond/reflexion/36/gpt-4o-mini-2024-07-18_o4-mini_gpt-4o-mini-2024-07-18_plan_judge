Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) + ethanedithiol + BF3 → dithiane A having substituent R = CH3CH2 (ethyl) on the acetal carbon.
Step 2: A + BuLi deprotonates the acetal carbon, then alkylation with bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) gives dithiane C bearing two identical ethyl substituents on that carbon.
Step 3: Hydrolysis (HgCl2/H2O/H+) converts C to ketone D = CH3CH2COCH2CH3, i.e. diethyl ketone (symmetrical).
Step 4: Wittig reaction: PPh3 + 3-bromopentane → phosphonium salt, deprotonation → ylide from 3-bromopentane (a secondary center bearing two ethyls), which reacts with D. The alkene E is C(Et)2=C(Et)2, i.e. tesseraethylethene, with full symmetry: the two alkene carbons are equivalent and all four ethyl substituents are equivalent.

Carbon count in E: 2 sp2 carbons + 4 × (CH2–CH3) = 10 C total, but symmetry reduces distinct types to: 1 signal for the two equivalent sp2 carbons, 1 for all CH2’s, 1 for all CH3’s = 3 signals.
