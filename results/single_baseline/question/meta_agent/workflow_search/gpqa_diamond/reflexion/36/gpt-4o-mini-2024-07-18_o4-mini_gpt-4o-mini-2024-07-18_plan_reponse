        "response": "Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) + ethanedithiol + BF3 \u2192 dithiane A having substituent R = CH3CH2 (ethyl) on the acetal carbon.\nStep 2: A + BuLi deprotonates the acetal carbon, then alkylation with bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) gives dithiane C bearing two identical ethyl substituents on that carbon.\nStep 3: Hydrolysis (HgCl2/H2O/H+) converts C to ketone D = CH3CH2COCH2CH3, i.e. diethyl ketone (symmetrical).\nStep 4: Wittig reaction: PPh3 + 3-bromopentane \u2192 phosphonium salt, deprotonation \u2192 ylide from 3-bromopentane (a secondary center bearing two ethyls), which reacts with D. The alkene E is C(Et)2=C(Et)2, i.e. tesseraethylethene, with full symmetry: the two alkene carbons are equivalent and all four ethyl substituents are equivalent.\n\nCarbon count in E: 2 sp2 carbons + 4 \u00d7 (CH2\u2013CH3) = 10 C total, but symmetry reduces distinct types to: 1 signal for the two equivalent sp2 carbons, 1 for all CH2\u2019s, 1 for all CH3\u2019s = 3 signals.\n\nAnswer:A)",
