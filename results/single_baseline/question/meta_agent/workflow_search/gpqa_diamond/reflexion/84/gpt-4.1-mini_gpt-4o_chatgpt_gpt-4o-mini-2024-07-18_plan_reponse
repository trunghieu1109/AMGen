            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, A is the albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes. The semi-major axis can be determined from the radial velocity method, where the Doppler shift is related to the planet's mass and distance from the star. The Doppler shift is proportional to the planet's mass divided by the semi-major axis. Given the shifts, we can set up the ratio of the semi-major axes: (M1 / a1) / (M2 / a2) = (0.03 / 0.04), where M1 and M2 are the masses of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. Solving for the ratio a1/a2, we find that a1/a2 = (M1 / M2) * (0.04 / 0.03). Substituting M1 = 7 Earth masses and M2 = 5 Earth masses, we get a1/a2 = (7/5) * (4/3). The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is then (a2/a1)^(1/2), which is the inverse of the square root of the semi-major axis ratio. Calculating this gives us the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\nAnswer:B)",
