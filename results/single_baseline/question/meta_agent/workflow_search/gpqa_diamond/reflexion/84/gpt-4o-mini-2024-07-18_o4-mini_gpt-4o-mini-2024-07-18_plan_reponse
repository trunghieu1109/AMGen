            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures Teq1/Teq2 for two planets with the same albedo around the same star. Teq\u221dTstar\u221a(Rstar/(2a)), so the ratio Teq1/Teq2=\u221a(a2/a1). We don\u2019t know semimajor axes directly but we have radial velocity amplitudes from Doppler shifts: K1=c\u0394\u03bb1/\u03bb=3\u00d710^5\u2009km/s\u00d70.03/6300\u22481.43\u2009km/s, K2\u22481.905\u2009km/s. For circular, transiting orbits, K\u221dMplanet/P^(1/3) (Mstar constant). Thus (P1/P2)^(1/3)=(M1 K2)/(M2 K1)=(7\u00d71.905)/(5\u00d71.43)\u22481.865, so P1/P2\u22481.865^3\u22486.49. Then a\u221dP^(2/3), so a1/a2=(P1/P2)^(2/3)=6.49^(2/3)\u22483.48. Hence Teq1/Teq2=\u221a(a2/a1)=1/\u221a3.48\u22480.54, matching choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
