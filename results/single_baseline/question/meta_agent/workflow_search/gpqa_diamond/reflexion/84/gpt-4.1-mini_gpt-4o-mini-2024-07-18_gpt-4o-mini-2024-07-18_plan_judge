Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we need to consider that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Since both planets orbit the same star, we can express their equilibrium temperatures in terms of their distances from the star. The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by T_eq = (L / (16 * π * σ * d^2))^(1/4). However, we do not have the distances directly. Given that both planets have the same albedo, we can assume that the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances from the star. Without specific distance values, we cannot calculate the exact ratio, but we can analyze the provided choices. The closest choice that seems reasonable based on typical planetary temperature ratios is ~ 1.05, which corresponds to choice A. However, this is based on the assumption that the distances are similar, which may not be accurate without further data.
