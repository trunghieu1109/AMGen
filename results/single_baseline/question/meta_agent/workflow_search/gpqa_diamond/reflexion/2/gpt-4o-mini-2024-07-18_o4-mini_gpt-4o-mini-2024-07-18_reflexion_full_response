Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TiAN', content='We have |ψ〉=a|↑〉+b|↓〉 with a=0.5, b=√3/2≈0.8660. ⟨σ_z⟩=|a|^2−|b|^2=0.25−0.75=−0.5. ⟨σ_x⟩=2Re(a*b)=2×0.5×0.8660=0.8660. Hence ⟨10σ_z+5σ_x⟩=10(−0.5)+5(0.8660)=−5+4.33=−0.67≈−0.7.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
