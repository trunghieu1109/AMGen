Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TiAN', content='The given state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩. The operator is 10σz + 5σx. We need to find the expectation value ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩. First, calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ separately. For σz, |↑⟩ is +1 and |↓⟩ is -1, so ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = |0.5|^2 - |√3/2|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. For σx, ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = 1, so ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = 2 * 0.5 * √3/2 = √3/2. The expectation value is 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2) = -5 + 5√3/2. Calculate 5√3/2 ≈ 4.33, so the expectation value is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
