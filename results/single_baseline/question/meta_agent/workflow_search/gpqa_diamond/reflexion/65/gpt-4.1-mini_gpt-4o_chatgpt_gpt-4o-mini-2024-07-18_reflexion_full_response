Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5eBU', content='The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators. All operators in the SMEFT must respect certain fundamental symmetries. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime that must be respected by all physical theories, including SMEFT. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations, is also a fundamental symmetry that must be respected. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories that must be respected by all operators. CP symmetry, however, is not necessarily respected by all operators, as CP violation is a known phenomenon in the Standard Model. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
