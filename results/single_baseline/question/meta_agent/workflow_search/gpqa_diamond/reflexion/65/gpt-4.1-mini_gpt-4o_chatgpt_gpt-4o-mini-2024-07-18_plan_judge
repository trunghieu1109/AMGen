Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators. All operators in the SMEFT must respect certain fundamental symmetries. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime that must be respected by all physical theories, including SMEFT. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations, is also a fundamental symmetry that must be respected. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories that must be respected by all operators. CP symmetry, however, is not necessarily respected by all operators, as CP violation is a known phenomenon in the Standard Model. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.
