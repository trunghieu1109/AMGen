Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 65eB', content='SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry (which includes Lorentz invariance) and by the CPT theorem they also respect CPT. CP is not required. Thus the correct choice is 1,2,4 which corresponds to choice4 (D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
