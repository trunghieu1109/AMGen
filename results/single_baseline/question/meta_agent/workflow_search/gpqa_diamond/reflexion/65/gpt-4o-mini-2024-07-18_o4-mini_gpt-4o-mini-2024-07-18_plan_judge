Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry (which includes Lorentz invariance) and by the CPT theorem they also respect CPT. CP is not required. Thus the correct choice is 1,2,4 which corresponds to choice4 (D).

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 4
