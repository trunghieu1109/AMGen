Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this, we need to analyze the resistance levels of the mutants compared to the wild-type. The wild-type has 100% resistance. The g1 mutant has 75% resistance, indicating G1 contributes to resistance but is not solely responsible. The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, suggesting G2 is crucial for resistance, possibly a transcription factor. The g3 mutant has 50% resistance, indicating G3 also contributes to resistance. The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, showing that G1 and G3 together contribute significantly to resistance, but not completely, as g2 is still needed. The g2g3 and g1g2 double mutants both have 0% resistance, reinforcing that G2 is essential for resistance. The fact that g1g3 has 10% resistance suggests some redundancy or interaction between G1 and G3. G2 being a transcription factor fits the data as its absence leads to complete loss of resistance. G1 being epistatic towards G3 means that G1's presence can mask the effect of G3, which is consistent with g1 having higher resistance than g3. Therefore, the best conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.
