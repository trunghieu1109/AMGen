Question: {'question': "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MHjR', content='The g2 knockout shows complete loss of resistance and masks the g1 and g3 phenotypes in double mutants, indicating G2 acts upstream as a transcription factor and is epistatic to both. The partial sensitivities of g1 and g3 and the more severe defect in the g1g3 double mutant indicate G1 and G3 have redundant functions.

Among the choices, only option A describes G2 as a transcription factor and G1 and G3 as redundant, with an epistatic relationship (though the epistasis direction is imperfectly described, A best matches the data).\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent MHjR (yourself):\nA)\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent DQVo:\nThe proposed answer (choice 1) misassigns epistasis. The data show that G2 knockout is fully susceptible and masks both g1 and g3 phenotypes (g1g2 and g2g3 are 0% resistant), so G2—not G1—is epistatic to G1 and G3. G1 and G3 display partial functional redundancy (g1g3 is more sensitive than either single mutant), rather than one being epistatic to the other. Therefore choice 1 is not correct.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
