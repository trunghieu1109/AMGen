proposed answer: We need the relative‐entropy non‐Gaussianity δ_b = S(τ) − S(ρ). For a pure cat state S(ρ)=0, so δ_b= S(τ), the entropy of the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments. For φ=−π/4 the state is the odd cat: |ψ>= (|α>−|−α>)/√(2(1−e^{−2α²})), α=0.5. Compute moments:
⟨a⟩=0,
⟨a^2⟩=α^2=0.25,
⟨n⟩=α^2(1+e^{−2α^2})/(1−e^{−2α^2})≈1.0208.
Then quadrature variances: Var(x)=½(⟨a^2⟩+⟨a†2⟩+⟨a a†⟩+⟨a†a⟩)=1.7708, Var(p)=1.2708. The symplectic eigenvalue ν=√(Var(x)Var(p))≈1.5, giving n_th=ν−½≈1.0. Thus S(τ)=(n_th+1)ln(n_th+1)−n_th ln n_th=2ln2=1.3863 nats.
This matches choice C).
