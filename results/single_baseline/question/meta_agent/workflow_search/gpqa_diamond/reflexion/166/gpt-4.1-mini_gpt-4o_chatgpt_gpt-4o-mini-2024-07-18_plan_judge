proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, we need to evaluate the expression del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the Schrödinger cat state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2)*exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Next, we construct the density matrix rho = |psi><psi|. The reference Gaussian state tau is typically chosen to have the same first and second moments as rho. We then compute the traces trace(rho*ln(rho)) and trace(tau*ln(tau)) to find del_b. This involves some complex calculations, but for the given parameters, the non-Gaussianity can be determined from the provided choices.
