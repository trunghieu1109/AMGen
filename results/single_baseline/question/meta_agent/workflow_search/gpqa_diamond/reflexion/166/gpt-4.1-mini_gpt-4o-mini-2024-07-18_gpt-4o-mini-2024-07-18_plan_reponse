We have the state defined and the parameters phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. We will compute the density matrix rho for the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state tau. After calculating the traces involved in the relative entropy formula, we can determine the value of nG. Given the choices provided, we will find the correct numerical result.\n\nAnswer:1.38",
