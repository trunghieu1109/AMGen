        "response": "To find the partition function Z of the system, we need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. We will calculate the energy E for each configuration and then use the Boltzmann factor e^(-E/kT) to find the contribution to the partition function from each configuration. After calculating the contributions, we will sum them up to find Z. The correct expression for Z will match one of the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)",
