Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.

        "response": "To find the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process \\( \\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \\), we need to consider the threshold energy for this reaction. The threshold energy is determined by the condition that the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is about 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the total energy required is 1.022 MeV. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of the CMB photon is \\( 10^{-3} \\) eV. Using the relation \\( E_{\\gamma} E_{\\text{CMB}} = (m_e c^2)^2 \\), where \\( E_{\\gamma} \\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, we can solve for \\( E_{\\gamma} \\). \\( E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\text{ MeV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\text{ MeV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ eV} = 2.6 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ eV} = 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} \\).\n\nAnswer:C)",
