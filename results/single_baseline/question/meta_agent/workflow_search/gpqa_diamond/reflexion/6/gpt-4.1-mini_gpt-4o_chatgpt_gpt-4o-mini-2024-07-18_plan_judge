Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the process \( \gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \), we need to consider the threshold energy for this reaction. The threshold energy is determined by the condition that the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is about 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the total energy required is 1.022 MeV. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of the CMB photon is \( 10^{-3} \) eV. Using the relation \( E_{\gamma} E_{\text{CMB}} = (m_e c^2)^2 \), where \( E_{\gamma} \) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, we can solve for \( E_{\gamma} \). \( E_{\gamma} = \frac{(0.511 \text{ MeV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = \frac{0.261121 \text{ MeV}^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{11} \text{ eV} = 2.6 \times 10^{11} \text{ eV} = 2.6 \times 10^5 \text{ GeV} \).
