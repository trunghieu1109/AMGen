Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The pair-production threshold requires E_γ E_CMB ≥ (m_e c^2)^2. With m_e c^2 ≃ 0.511 MeV = 5.11×10^5 eV, (m_e c^2)^2 ≃ 2.61×10^11 eV^2. Dividing by E_CMB ≃ 10^-3 eV gives E_γ ≃ 2.61×10^14 eV ≃ 2.6×10^5 GeV.
