Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the formula L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien's Law). Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R1 = 1.5R2. The luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities do not affect luminosity.
