Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we need to consider both the radius and mass of the stars. The luminosity of a star can be approximated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the fourth power of the radius and the square of the temperature. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can assume they have similar temperatures. However, the mass-luminosity relation also plays a role, especially since Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. The effective luminosity can be calculated by considering both the radius and mass. The radius ratio is (1.5)^4 = 5.0625, and the mass ratio is (1.5)^3.5, which is approximately 11.39. The combined effect will give us a luminosity ratio that is greater than the radius effect alone. After careful consideration of these factors, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor close to one of the provided choices.
