Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two stars radiating as black bodies. Star₁ has R₁/R₂=1.5, and spectroscopic measurements show the same observed peak wavelength λ_obs, but Star₂ has radial velocity v=700 km/s (redshift). For Star₁ (v≈0), λ₁,em=λ_obs. For Star₂, λ₂,obs=λ₂,em(1+v/c)=λ_obs, so λ₂,em=λ_obs/(1+β) with β=700×10³/3×10⁸≈2.33×10⁻³. Thus T₂/T₁=λ₁,em/λ₂,em=1+β≈1.00233, so T₁/T₂≈1/(1.00233)=0.99767. Luminosity ratio L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴=1.5²·0.99767⁴≈2.25·0.9907≈2.23.
