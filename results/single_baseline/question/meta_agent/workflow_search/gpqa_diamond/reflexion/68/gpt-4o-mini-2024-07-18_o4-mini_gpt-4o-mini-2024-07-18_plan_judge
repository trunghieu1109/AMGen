Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the lab-frame decay length L=c·τ0·γ, where τ0=8×10⁻¹⁶ s, γ=E/m=27 GeV/3.41 GeV≈7.92, c≈3×10⁸ m/s. So L≈3×10⁸·8×10⁻¹⁶·7.92≈1.9×10⁻⁶ m (mean path). To observe at least 30% of decays within a distance x, 1–e^(−x/L)≥0.3 ⇒ x≥−L ln(0.7)≈1.9×10⁻⁶·0.357≈6.8×10⁻⁷ m. The closest choice on the order of 10⁻⁶ m is 2.08×10⁻⁶ m.
