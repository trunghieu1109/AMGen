        "response": "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^{0}, we need to calculate the distance the particle travels during its lifetime. The proper lifetime of X^{0} is given as \\tau_{0} = 8 \\times 10^{-16} s. We can find the speed of the particle using its energy and mass. The total energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m of X^{0} is 3.41 GeV. We can use the relativistic relation to find the momentum and then the speed. The distance traveled by the particle in its lifetime can be calculated as d = v * \\tau_{0}. We need to ensure that the resolution is such that it can detect at least 30% of the decays, which means the resolution must be less than or equal to the distance traveled by the particle during its lifetime. After calculating the necessary values, we can compare them to the provided choices to find the correct resolution needed.\n\nAnswer:2.08*1e-6 m",
