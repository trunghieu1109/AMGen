proposed answer: To find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the particle X^0 before it decays. The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is given as \( 8 \times 10^{-16} \) s. The energy of the particle is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. First, we calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \). Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \). The distance traveled is \( d = c \tau \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. We want to find the distance such that 30% of the particles decay within this distance. The probability of decay within time \( t \) is given by \( 1 - e^{-t/\tau} \). We set this equal to 0.3 and solve for \( t \), then calculate the corresponding distance.
