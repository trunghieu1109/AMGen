Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xWMy', content='We need the lab-frame decay length L=c·τ0·γ, where τ0=8×10⁻¹⁶ s, γ=E/m=27\u2009GeV/3.41\u2009GeV≈7.92, c≈3×10⁸\u2009m/s. So L≈3×10⁸·8×10⁻¹⁶·7.92≈1.9×10⁻⁶\u2009m (mean path). To observe at least 30% of decays within a distance x, 1–e^(−x/L)≥0.3 ⇒ x≥−L\u2009ln(0.7)≈1.9×10⁻⁶·0.357≈6.8×10⁻⁷\u2009m. The closest choice on the order of 10⁻⁶\u2009m is 2.08×10⁻⁶\u2009m.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
