Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent WMy2', content='To find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the particle X^0 before it decays. The proper lifetime \\( \\tau_0 \\) is given as \\( 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\) s. The energy of the particle is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. First, we calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) using \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\). Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is \\( \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 \\). The distance traveled is \\( d = c \\tau \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light. We want to find the distance such that 30% of the particles decay within this distance. The probability of decay within time \\( t \\) is given by \\( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\). We set this equal to 0.3 and solve for \\( t \\), then calculate the corresponding distance.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
