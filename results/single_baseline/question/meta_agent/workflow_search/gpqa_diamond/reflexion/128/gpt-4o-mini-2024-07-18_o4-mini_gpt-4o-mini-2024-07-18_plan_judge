Question: Example(question='Identify compound E in the following reaction scheme.\nCompound A, when reacted with HCN, produces compound B.\nCompound B, upon reduction with H2 in the presence of Pd, forms compound C.\nCompound C, upon reaction with HNO2, forms compound D.\nCompound D, upon elimination of an inert gas, forms compound E.\nHints:\na) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\nb) The IR spectrum of compound A exhibits a strong peak at around 1750 cm^-1 whereas, IR spectrum of compound E exhibits strong peak at around 1715 cm^-1.', choice1='4-methylcycloheptan-1-one', choice2='2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one', choice3='2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one', choice4='3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Compound A shows a C=O at 1750 cm–1 and gives an exocyclic isopropylidene alkene upon Wittig, so A must be 1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one (i.e. cyclopentanone with Me at C1 and C2). A + HCN → cyanohydrin B at C4; B + H2/Pd → amino alcohol C (HO and CH2NH2 at C4); C + HNO2 → diazonium D (β-hydroxy diazonium); D loses N2 (inert gas) via an α-hydroxy amine diazotization to give a ring ketone with a new Me group derived from the former CH2NH2. Numbering so the ketone is at C1, there are Me substituents at C2, C3, and C4, i.e. 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. Its IR C=O at 1715 cm–1 matches, so E is 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one.
