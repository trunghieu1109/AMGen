    <pre>Compound A shows a C=O at 1750 cm–1 and gives an exocyclic isopropylidene alkene upon Wittig, so A must be 1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one (i.e. cyclopentanone with Me at C1 and C2). A + HCN → cyanohydrin B at C4; B + H2/Pd → amino alcohol C (HO and CH2NH2 at C4); C + HNO2 → diazonium D (β-hydroxy diazonium); D loses N2 (inert gas) via an α-hydroxy amine diazotization to give a ring ketone with a new Me group derived from the former CH2NH2. Numbering so the ketone is at C1, there are Me substituents at C2, C3, and C4, i.e. 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. Its IR C=O at 1715 cm–1 matches, so E is 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one.
