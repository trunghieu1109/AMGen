Question: Example(question='Identify the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n', choice1='1. NaNH2, methyl chloride\n2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate\n3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n4. Ba(OH)2', choice2='1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride\n2. Li/liq. NH3\n3. O3/ H2O\n4. NH4OH', choice3='1. NaNH2, methanol\n2. Li/liq. NH3\n3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n4. NH4OH', choice4='1. NaNH2, methyl chloride\n2. H2/Pd\n3. Ba(OH)2\n3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to alkylate the acetylide with a cyclohexyl halide (not a methyl or ethyl), then reduce the alkyne to an alkene, ozonolyze to give two cyclohexanecarbaldehydes, and finally do an aldol with NH4OH. Choice 2 is the only one that follows this logic (despite the typo ‘ethyl’ instead of ‘cyclohexyl’).
