        "response": "We need to alkylate the acetylide with a cyclohexyl halide (not a methyl or ethyl), then reduce the alkyne to an alkene, ozonolyze to give two cyclohexanecarbaldehydes, and finally do an aldol with NH4OH. Choice 2 is the only one that follows this logic (despite the typo \u2018ethyl\u2019 instead of \u2018cyclohexyl\u2019).\n\nAnswer:B)",
