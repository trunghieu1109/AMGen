proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to consider the transformations required. First, we need to add a methyl group to the terminal alkyne, which can be done using NaNH2 followed by methyl chloride. Then, we need to partially hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene, which can be done using H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Pd on calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst). Next, we need to perform an ozonolysis to form the aldehyde, which can be done using O3 followed by a reducing agent like (CH3)2S. Finally, we need to form the alcohol, which can be done using Ba(OH)2. The sequence that matches these steps is choice 1.
