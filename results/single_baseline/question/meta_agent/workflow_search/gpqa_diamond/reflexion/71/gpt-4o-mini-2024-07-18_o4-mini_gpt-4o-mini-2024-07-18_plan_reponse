        "response": "The sequence converts norbornadiene ether into triptycene, then acid hydrolysis gives triptycen-9-ol, Pfitzner\u2013Moffatt oxidation (SO3\u00b7pyr/DMSO) yields triptycen-9-one (anthrone), and heating induces dehydration/decarbonylation to form anthracene. Anthracene (C14H10) has D2h symmetry with four sets of equivalent protons (H1,8; H2,7; H3,6; H4,5).\n\nAnswer:D)",
