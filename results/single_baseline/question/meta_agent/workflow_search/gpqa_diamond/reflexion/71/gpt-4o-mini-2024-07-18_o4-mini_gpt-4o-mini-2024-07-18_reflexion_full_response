Counting each unique set of equivalent hydrogens gives a total of 8.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6t49 (yourself):\nB)\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent VrPK:\nThe justification for eight distinct hydrogens is superficial. Without a clear structural diagram of product 4 and a symmetry analysis, you cannot conclude there are eight unique proton environments. A proper count requires drawing the final tetracyclic framework, labeling each hydrogen, then applying the molecule’s symmetry (mirror planes, rotation axes) to group equivalent protons. When this is done, many of the methylene and bridgehead protons coincide in symmetry-related positions, reducing the total number of distinct sets well below eight.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better."}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=1)]
