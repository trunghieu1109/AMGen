Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4, we need to analyze the structure of the compound after each step of the reaction. Starting from the initial compound, we consider how the reactions modify the structure and the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. After going through the reactions, we can deduce the final structure and count the distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the analysis, the final product 4 has 8 distinct hydrogen atoms.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 4
