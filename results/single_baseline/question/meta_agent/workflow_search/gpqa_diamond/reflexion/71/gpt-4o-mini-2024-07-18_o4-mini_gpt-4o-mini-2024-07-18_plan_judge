Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The sequence converts norbornadiene ether into triptycene, then acid hydrolysis gives triptycen-9-ol, Pfitzner–Moffatt oxidation (SO3·pyr/DMSO) yields triptycen-9-one (anthrone), and heating induces dehydration/decarbonylation to form anthracene. Anthracene (C14H10) has D2h symmetry with four sets of equivalent protons (H1,8; H2,7; H3,6; H4,5).
