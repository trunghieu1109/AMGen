        "response": "For A: Deprotonation of the spiro alcohol by KH gives an alkoxide that undergoes intramolecular attack on the vinyl group to give the bicyclic enone. The product is thus an unsaturated bicyclo[5.3.1]undecenone with retention of the E\u2010alkene geometry: (E)\u2010bicyclo[5.3.1]undec\u20101(11)\u2010en\u20104\u2010one.\n\nFor B: LDA first deprotonates the allylic alcohol\u2019s conjugate acetate (formed by reaction with acetyl bromide) to generate a ketene intermediate which rearranges via an Ireland\u2013Claisen (sigmatropic) rearrangement. Under the strongly basic LDA conditions, the rearranged carboxylic acid remains as its lithium salt, giving lithium 3\u2010ethylpent\u20104\u2010enoate.\n\nAnswer:B",
