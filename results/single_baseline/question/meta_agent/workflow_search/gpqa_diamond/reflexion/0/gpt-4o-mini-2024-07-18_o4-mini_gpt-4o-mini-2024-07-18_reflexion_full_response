Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent j36X', content='We have two quantum states with lifetimes τ1=10^-9 s and τ2=10^-8 s. The energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each level is approximately ΔE_i ≈ ħ/τ_i, where ħ≈6.58×10^-16 eV·s. Thus ΔE1≈6.58×10^-16/10^-9≈6.6×10^-7 eV and ΔE2≈6.6×10^-8 eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference ΔE must exceed the larger linewidth (≈6.6×10^-7 eV). Among the choices, only 10^-4 eV is significantly larger than ~10^-6 eV. Therefore the correct choice is D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
