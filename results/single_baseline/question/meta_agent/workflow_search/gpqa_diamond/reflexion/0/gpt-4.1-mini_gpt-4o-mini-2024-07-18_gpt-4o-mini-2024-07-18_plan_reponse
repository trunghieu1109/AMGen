        "response": "To distinguish between two quantum states with lifetimes \u03c41 and \u03c42, we can use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy \u0394E is related to the uncertainty in time \u0394t by the relation \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. The effective time uncertainty can be taken as the longer lifetime, which is 10^-8 sec in this case. Therefore, we can calculate the minimum energy difference that can be resolved as \u0394E = \u0127/(2 * \u0394t). Using \u0127 \u2248 1.055 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s, we find \u0394E for \u0394t = 10^-8 sec. This gives us \u0394E \u2248 5.27 x 10^-27 J, which is equivalent to about 3.29 x 10^-9 eV. This means that to clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value. Among the choices given, 10^-9 eV is the closest but still less than the calculated value, while 10^-8 eV is greater than the calculated value. Therefore, the best choice for a clearly resolvable energy difference is 10^-8 eV.\n\nAnswer:C",
