    <pre>To distinguish two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV·s). For the first state with a lifetime of 10^-9 s, the energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-9 s). For the second state with a lifetime of 10^-8 s, the energy uncertainty is ΔE2 ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-8 s). To resolve the two states, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the larger of these uncertainties. Calculating these uncertainties: ΔE1 ≥ 6.58 x 10^-16 eV / (2 * 10^-9 s) = 3.29 x 10^-7 eV and ΔE2 ≥ 6.58 x 10^-16 eV / (2 * 10^-8 s) = 3.29 x 10^-8 eV. The energy difference should be greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV to resolve the states. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV.
