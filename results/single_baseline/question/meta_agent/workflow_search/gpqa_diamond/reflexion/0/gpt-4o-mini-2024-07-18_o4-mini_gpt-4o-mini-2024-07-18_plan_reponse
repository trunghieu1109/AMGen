        "response": "We have two quantum states with lifetimes \u03c41=10^-9 s and \u03c42=10^-8 s. The energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each level is approximately \u0394E_i \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4_i, where \u0127\u22486.58\u00d710^-16 eV\u00b7s. Thus \u0394E1\u22486.58\u00d710^-16/10^-9\u22486.6\u00d710^-7 eV and \u0394E2\u22486.6\u00d710^-8 eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference \u0394E must exceed the larger linewidth (\u22486.6\u00d710^-7 eV). Among the choices, only 10^-4 eV is significantly larger than ~10^-6 eV. Therefore the correct choice is D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
