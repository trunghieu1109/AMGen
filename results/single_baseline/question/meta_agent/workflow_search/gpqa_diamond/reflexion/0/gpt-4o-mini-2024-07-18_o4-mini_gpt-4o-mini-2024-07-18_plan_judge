Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two quantum states with lifetimes τ1=10^-9 s and τ2=10^-8 s. The energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each level is approximately ΔE_i ≈ ħ/τ_i, where ħ≈6.58×10^-16 eV·s. Thus ΔE1≈6.58×10^-16/10^-9≈6.6×10^-7 eV and ΔE2≈6.6×10^-8 eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference ΔE must exceed the larger linewidth (≈6.6×10^-7 eV). Among the choices, only 10^-4 eV is significantly larger than ~10^-6 eV. Therefore the correct choice is D).
