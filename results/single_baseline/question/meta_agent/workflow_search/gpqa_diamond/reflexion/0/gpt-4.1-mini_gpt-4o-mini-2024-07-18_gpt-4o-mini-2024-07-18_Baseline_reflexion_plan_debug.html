    <pre>To distinguish between two quantum states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, we can use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in time Δt by the relation ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. The effective time uncertainty can be taken as the longer lifetime, which is 10^-8 sec in this case. Therefore, we can calculate the minimum energy difference that can be resolved as ΔE = ħ/(2 * Δt). Using ħ ≈ 1.055 x 10^-34 J·s, we find ΔE for Δt = 10^-8 sec. This gives us ΔE ≈ 5.27 x 10^-27 J, which is equivalent to about 3.29 x 10^-9 eV. This means that to clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value. Among the choices given, 10^-9 eV is the closest but still less than the calculated value, while 10^-8 eV is greater than the calculated value. Therefore, the best choice for a clearly resolvable energy difference is 10^-8 eV.
