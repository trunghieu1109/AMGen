Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We model the survival probability as P = exp(-T/(γ τ₀)), where T = R/c = 30 m / (3×10⁸ m/s) = 1×10⁻⁷ s. Given γ₁ = 20 yields P₁ = 1/3, so ln(3) = T/(20 τ₀) ⇒ τ₀ ≃ 1×10⁻⁷ s / (20 ln 3) ≃ 4.55×10⁻⁹ s. To achieve P₂ = 2/3, set ln(3/2) = T/(γ₂ τ₀) ⇒ γ₂ = T/(τ₀ ln 1.5) ≃ 1×10⁻⁷ / (4.55×10⁻⁹ × 0.4055) ≃ 54.2 ≃ 54.
