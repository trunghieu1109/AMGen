Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we need to understand how the Lorentz factor affects the decay length of the particles. The current Lorentz factor of ~20 allows one third of the particles to reach the walls, indicating that the decay length is not sufficient for more than that fraction. To achieve two thirds reaching the walls, we need to increase the Lorentz factor significantly. The choices provided are 28, 40, 68, and 54. Since we need a substantial increase from 20, a Lorentz factor of 40 or higher seems necessary. Among the options, 40 is the lowest that could potentially allow for two thirds of the particles to reach the walls, making it a reasonable choice to consider.
