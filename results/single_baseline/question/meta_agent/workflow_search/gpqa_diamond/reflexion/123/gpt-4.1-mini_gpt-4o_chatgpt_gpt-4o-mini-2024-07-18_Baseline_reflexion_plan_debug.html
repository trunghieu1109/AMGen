    <pre>The problem involves particles traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a given Lorentz factor, and we need to determine a new Lorentz factor that allows more particles to reach the detector walls. The Lorentz factor is related to time dilation, which affects how far the particles can travel before decaying. If one third of the particles reach the walls with a Lorentz factor of 20, we need to increase the Lorentz factor to allow more particles to reach the walls. The relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance traveled is linear, so to double the fraction of particles reaching the walls (from one third to two thirds), we need to double the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the new Lorentz factor should be 40.
