Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The problem involves particles traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a given Lorentz factor, and we need to determine a new Lorentz factor that allows more particles to reach the detector walls. The Lorentz factor is related to time dilation, which affects how far the particles can travel before decaying. If one third of the particles reach the walls with a Lorentz factor of 20, we need to increase the Lorentz factor to allow more particles to reach the walls. The relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance traveled is linear, so to double the fraction of particles reaching the walls (from one third to two thirds), we need to double the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the new Lorentz factor should be 40.
