Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent PVfY', content='To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a viral infectious disease, it is essential to identify the virus accurately and then develop a suitable detection method. The most effective approach for detecting retroviruses is to use molecular techniques such as PCR, which can amplify viral RNA or DNA. cDNA sequencing is a common method used to identify retroviruses, as they are RNA viruses that require reverse transcription to DNA for detection. Therefore, developing a real-time PCR kit after identifying the virus through cDNA sequencing would provide a quick and accurate diagnostic tool.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
