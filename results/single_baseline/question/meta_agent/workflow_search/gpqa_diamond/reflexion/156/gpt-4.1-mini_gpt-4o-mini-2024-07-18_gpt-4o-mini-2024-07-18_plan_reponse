            "There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?",
            "First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis",
            "First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.",
            "First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.",
            "First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.",

        "response": "To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a viral infectious disease, it is essential to identify the virus accurately and then develop a suitable detection method. The most effective approach for detecting retroviruses is to use molecular techniques such as PCR, which can amplify viral RNA or DNA. cDNA sequencing is a common method used to identify retroviruses, as they are RNA viruses that require reverse transcription to DNA for detection. Therefore, developing a real-time PCR kit after identifying the virus through cDNA sequencing would provide a quick and accurate diagnostic tool.\n\nAnswer:D",
