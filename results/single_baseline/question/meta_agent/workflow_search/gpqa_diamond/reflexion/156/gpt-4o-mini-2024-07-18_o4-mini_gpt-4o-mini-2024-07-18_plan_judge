Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Retroviruses are RNA viruses requiring reverse transcription into cDNA before amplification. A rapid and sensitive approach uses real-time PCR on cDNA for quantification and specificity. Sequencing cDNA confirms viral identity and target regions for primer design. Thus, designing a real-time RT-PCR kit based on cDNA sequencing is optimal.
