Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to identify which molecule has C3h symmetry: a threefold rotation axis plus a horizontal mirror plane, without additional perpendicular C2 axes. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with only C2 symmetry at best. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal arrangement but each isopropyl substituent breaks the horizontal mirror plane, giving only C3 symmetry. The benzo-trifuran hexaone is an asymmetric polycycle. The triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone is based on triphenylene (D3h) but the furan-hexaone annulations break the vertical mirror planes while preserving the C3 axis and the horizontal plane, yielding C3h symmetry.
