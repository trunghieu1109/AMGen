        "response": "For reaction A, t-BuOK favors the kinetic enolate at the less\u2010hindered \u03b1\u2010position (original C6), giving the Michael adduct with the propanoate chain at that site. Numbering from the chain as C1 places the original C2 (bearing ethyl + methyl) at ring C3 and the original C6 (bearing methyl) at ring C5, with the ketone at C4. Hence A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. For reaction B, 1-nitropropane deprotonates at C2 and adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile to give a six\u2010carbon nitrile (hexanenitrile) with a nitro at C4 and a methyl at C3. Thus B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. Matching to the given options gives choice 3 (C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
