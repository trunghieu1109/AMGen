Question: Example(question='Complete the following reactions and select the major products by considering the steric hindrance, and the stability of the products.\n2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B', choice1='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile', choice2='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile', choice3='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile', choice4='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: For reaction A, the enolate from 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one will add to the beta position of ethyl acrylate, forming ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. For reaction B, 1-nitropropane reacts with (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) to form 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, as the reaction involves a Michael addition followed by a Henry reaction. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 1.
