Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 0K2z', content='The compound is undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol with substituents at C2 (Me), C6 (Cl), and C9 (Et). Identify stereocenters: C5 (OH, H, C4 and C6 chains are all different), C6 (Cl, H, and two different carbon chains), and C9 (Et, H, and two different carbon chains) – total 3 chiral centers → 2^3 = 8 configurations. There are two C=C bonds (3–4 and 7–8), each giving E/Z → 2^2 = 4 geometric isomers. Total stereoisomers = 8 × 4 = 32, matching choice C.\n\nAnswer:C', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
