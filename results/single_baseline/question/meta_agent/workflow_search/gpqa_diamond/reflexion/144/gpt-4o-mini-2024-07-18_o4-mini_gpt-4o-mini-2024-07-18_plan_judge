Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The compound is undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol with substituents at C2 (Me), C6 (Cl), and C9 (Et). Identify stereocenters: C5 (OH, H, C4 and C6 chains are all different), C6 (Cl, H, and two different carbon chains), and C9 (Et, H, and two different carbon chains) – total 3 chiral centers → 2^3 = 8 configurations. There are two C=C bonds (3–4 and 7–8), each giving E/Z → 2^2 = 4 geometric isomers. Total stereoisomers = 8 × 4 = 32, matching choice C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 2
