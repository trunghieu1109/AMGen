Identify stereocenters: C5 (OH, H, C4 and C6 chains are all different), C6 (Cl, H, and two different carbon chains), and C9 (Et, H, and two different carbon chains) \u2013 total 3 chiral centers \u2192 2^3 = 8 configurations. There are two C=C bonds (3\u20134 and 7\u20138), each giving E/Z \u2192 2^2 = 4 geometric isomers. Total stereoisomers = 8 \u00d7 4 = 32, matching choice C.\n\nAnswer:C",
