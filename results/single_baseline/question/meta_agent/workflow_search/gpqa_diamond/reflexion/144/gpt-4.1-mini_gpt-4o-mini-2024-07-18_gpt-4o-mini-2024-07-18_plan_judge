Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the number of stereoisomers for 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol, we need to analyze the structure for chiral centers and double bonds. The compound has 4 chiral centers and 2 double bonds. The formula for stereoisomers is 2^n for chiral centers, and we also need to account for geometric isomers from the double bonds. Each double bond can contribute to cis/trans isomerism. After careful consideration, the total number of stereoisomers is calculated to be 16, considering both chiral centers and geometric isomers from the double bonds.
