    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;}

    <pre>The probability of a planet transiting its host star is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis of its orbit. The semi-major axis can be determined using Kepler&#39;s third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, with the proportionality constant depending on the mass of the host star. Since both planets have circular orbits, we can use the formula for the probability of transit: P(transit) = R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis. Given that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2, and the mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2, we can calculate the semi-major axes for both planets. For Planet_1, the semi-major axis a_1 is smaller due to the shorter period and larger host star mass. For Planet_2, the semi-major axis a_2 is larger. Therefore, the probability of transit for Planet_1 is higher. Calculating the ratio of the probabilities, we find that Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability to transit than Planet_2.
