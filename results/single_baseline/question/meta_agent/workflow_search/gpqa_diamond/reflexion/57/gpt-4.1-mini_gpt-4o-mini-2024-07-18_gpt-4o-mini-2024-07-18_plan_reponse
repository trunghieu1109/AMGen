        "response": "To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we need to analyze each option. Superstring Theory is a high-energy theory that often requires regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) also requires regularization due to divergences at high energies. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) similarly has issues with high-energy divergences. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory and does not have the same issues with high-energy divergences as quantum theories do. Therefore, it does not require regularization at high energies.\n\nAnswer:D",
