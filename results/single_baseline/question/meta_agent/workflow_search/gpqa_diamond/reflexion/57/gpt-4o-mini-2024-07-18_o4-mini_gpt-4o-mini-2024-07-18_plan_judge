Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We compare the four options:

1. Superstring Theory: A framework where fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings rather than point particles. It is ultraviolet finite and does not require regularization at high energies; it provides a built-in cutoff at the string scale.

2. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): A quantum field theory of electrons and photons. It has ultraviolet divergences and requires regularization and renormalization.

3. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): The quantum field theory of quarks and gluons. It too has ultraviolet divergences needing regularization and renormalization.

4. Classical Electrodynamics: A classical field theory with point charges; it has singular self-energy issues at zero distance, effectively requiring a regulator if treated point-wise, though not in the quantum sense.

Only Superstring Theory is inherently UV finite and never needs high-energy regularization.
