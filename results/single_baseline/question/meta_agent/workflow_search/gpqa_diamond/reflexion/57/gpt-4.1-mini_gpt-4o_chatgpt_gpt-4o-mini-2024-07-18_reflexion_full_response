Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent WL9a', content='Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise in calculations. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are both quantum field theories that require regularization to deal with divergences at high energies. Superstring Theory is a theoretical framework that aims to unify all fundamental forces and is believed to be finite, thus not requiring regularization in the same way as QED or QCD. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory and does not involve the same kind of infinities as quantum field theories, so it does not require regularization at high energies. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is Classical Electrodynamics.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
