Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the annihilation of the electron and positron, we note that one photon is emitted in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. This means they are moving in opposite vertical directions while having the same horizontal component. The angle between the two directions of the photons can be calculated as 180 degrees minus the angle formed by their vertical components. Since they are emitted at equal angles from the horizontal, the angle between them is actually 180 degrees minus the angle of separation. Given the choices provided, the angle that best represents the separation of the two photons is 138 degrees, as it accounts for the vertical separation in the context of the problem.
