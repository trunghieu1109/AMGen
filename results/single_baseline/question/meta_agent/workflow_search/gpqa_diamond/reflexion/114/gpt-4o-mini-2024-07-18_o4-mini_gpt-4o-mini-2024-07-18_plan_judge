Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have an electron (mass m) moving to the right with Lorentz factor γ₁=4 and a positron moving to the left with γ₂=2. In the lab frame:

• Electron energy E₁=γ₁m=4m, momentum p₁=β₁γ₁m with β₁=√(1−1/γ₁²)=√15/4 ⇒ p₁=√15 m.
• Positron energy E₂=γ₂m=2m, momentum p₂=β₂γ₂m with β₂=√(1−1/γ₂²)=√3/2 ⇒ p₂=√3 m (to the left).

Total energy E=E₁+E₂=6m, total momentum p=p₁−p₂=(√15−√3)m.

After annihilation into two photons of equal energy Eγ moving symmetrically about the horizontal axis at angles ±θ, we have:

• Energy: 2Eγ=6m ⇒ Eγ=3m.
• Momentum x–component: 2Eγ cosθ = p ⇒ 6m cosθ=(√15−√3)m ⇒ cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.3568 ⇒ θ≈69.15°.

The angle between the two photons is 2θ≈138.3° ≈ 138°.
