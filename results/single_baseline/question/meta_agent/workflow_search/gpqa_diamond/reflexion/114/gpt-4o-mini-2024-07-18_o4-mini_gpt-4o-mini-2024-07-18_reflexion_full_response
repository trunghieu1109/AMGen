Question: {'question': 'An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', 'choice1': '96', 'choice2': '74', 'choice3': '138', 'choice4': '172'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 7Iqo', content='We have an electron (mass m) moving to the right with Lorentz factor γ₁=4 and a positron moving to the left with γ₂=2. In the lab frame:\n\n• Electron energy E₁=γ₁m=4m, momentum p₁=β₁γ₁m with β₁=√(1−1/γ₁²)=√15/4 ⇒ p₁=√15 m.\n• Positron energy E₂=γ₂m=2m, momentum p₂=β₂γ₂m with β₂=√(1−1/γ₂²)=√3/2 ⇒ p₂=√3 m (to the left).\n\nTotal energy E=E₁+E₂=6m, total momentum p=p₁−p₂=(√15−√3)m.\n\nAfter annihilation into two photons of equal energy Eγ moving symmetrically about the horizontal axis at angles ±θ, we have:\n\n• Energy: 2Eγ=6m ⇒ Eγ=3m.\n• Momentum x–component: 2Eγ cosθ = p ⇒ 6m\u2009cosθ=(√15−√3)m ⇒ cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.3568 ⇒ θ≈69.15°.\n\nThe angle between the two photons is 2θ≈138.3° ≈ 138°.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
