    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy in the center of mass frame of the electron and positron system. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is related to the velocity by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \). For the electron, \( \gamma = 4 \), so its velocity \( v_e = \sqrt{1-1/16}c = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \). For the positron, \( \gamma = 2 \), so its velocity \( v_p = \sqrt{1-1/4}c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \). In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons must be emitted back-to-back to conserve momentum. The angle between the directions of the photons in the lab frame can be found by considering the relativistic velocity addition and the fact that the photons are emitted symmetrically in the center of mass frame. The angle between the photons in the lab frame is given by \( \theta = 2 \arccos\left(\frac{v}{c}\right) \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the center of mass. The velocity of the center of mass \( v_{cm} \) can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. After calculating, we find that the angle between the directions of the photons is 138 degrees.
