Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy in the center of mass frame of the electron and positron system. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is related to the velocity by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \). For the electron, \( \gamma = 4 \), so its velocity \( v_e = \sqrt{1-1/16}c = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \). For the positron, \( \gamma = 2 \), so its velocity \( v_p = \sqrt{1-1/4}c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \). In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons must be emitted back-to-back to conserve momentum. The angle between the directions of the photons in the lab frame can be found by considering the relativistic velocity addition and the fact that the photons are emitted symmetrically in the center of mass frame. The angle between the photons in the lab frame is given by \( \theta = 2 \arccos\left(\frac{v}{c}\right) \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the center of mass. The velocity of the center of mass \( v_{cm} \) can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. After calculating, we find that the angle between the directions of the photons is 138 degrees.
