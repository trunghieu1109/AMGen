            "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine\u00ae, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.",

        "response": "To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed, we need to analyze the given sequence. The sequence provided is the plus strand of the construct. We need to check for any issues that could prevent proper expression. The options given are related to translation issues. Let's consider each option: 1) Lack of a linker sequence could cause proteolysis, but this would not prevent expression, just stability. 2) Early termination of translation could be due to a stop codon. 3) A missense mutation in the antigenic determinant could affect its function but not expression. 4) The UAA codon is a stop codon, not a tRNA issue. Let's check for stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG, a start codon, and we need to check for stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) that could cause early termination. Scanning the sequence, we find a TGA at position 54-56, which is an early stop codon. This would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to no full-length protein being produced.\n\nAnswer:B)",
