    <pre>To identify the unknown compound based on the provided 1H NMR data, we need to analyze the chemical shifts and splitting patterns. The presence of a double bond is indicated by the chemical shift at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), which suggests a trans configuration due to the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz). The chemical shift at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) also supports the presence of a double bond. The signals at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) and 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggest the presence of methyl groups. Given these observations, the compound is likely to be Trans-propenyl acetate, as it matches the expected NMR characteristics for that structure.
