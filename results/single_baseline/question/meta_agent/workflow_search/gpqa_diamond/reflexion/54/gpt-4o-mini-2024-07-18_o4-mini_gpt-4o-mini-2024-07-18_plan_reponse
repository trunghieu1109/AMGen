        "response": "We have 1H NMR signals at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), indicating two vinyl protons with large trans coupling (J\u224816 Hz) and one of them coupling to a methyl (J\u22486\u20137 Hz). A singlet at 2.1 ppm is the acetate methyl, and a doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H) is the vinyl methyl. This matches CH3\u2013CH=CH\u2013OAc with a trans double bond. Therefore the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nAnswer:A)",
