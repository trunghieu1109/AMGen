            "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n",

The eigenvector must be normalized and should reflect the direction specified by the angles \\theta and \\phi.
