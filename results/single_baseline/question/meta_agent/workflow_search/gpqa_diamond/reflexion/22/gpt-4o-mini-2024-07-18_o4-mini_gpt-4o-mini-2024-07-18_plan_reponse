            "In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?",
            "3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran",

        "response": "The substrate is an aryl ether bearing a terminal alkene (O\u2013CH2\u2013C(CH3)2\u2013CH=CH2). In HBr, the alkene is protonated to give a tertiary cation adjacent to the ether oxygen. That cation can cyclize intramolecularly onto the aromatic ring at either the ortho or the para position to give two cyclic ethers: a six\u2010membered chromane (3,3,4-trimethylchromane) from ortho attack, and a five-membered dihydrobenzofuran (3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran) from para attack. Hence the two new TLC spots are these cyclized products, matching choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
