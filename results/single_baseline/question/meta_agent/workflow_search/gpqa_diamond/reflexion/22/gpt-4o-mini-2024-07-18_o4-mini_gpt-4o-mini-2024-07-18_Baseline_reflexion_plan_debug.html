    <pre>The substrate is an aryl ether bearing a terminal alkene (O–CH2–C(CH3)2–CH=CH2). In HBr, the alkene is protonated to give a tertiary cation adjacent to the ether oxygen. That cation can cyclize intramolecularly onto the aromatic ring at either the ortho or the para position to give two cyclic ethers: a six‐membered chromane (3,3,4-trimethylchromane) from ortho attack, and a five-membered dihydrobenzofuran (3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran) from para attack. Hence the two new TLC spots are these cyclized products, matching choice 1.
