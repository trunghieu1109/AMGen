    <pre>The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. This is an alkene reacting with HBr, which typically leads to a Markovnikov addition of HBr across the double bond. The alkene part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which can form a carbocation at the more substituted position (tertiary) after the addition of H+. The resulting carbocation can then react with Br- to form a bromoalkane. The possible products would be bromoalkanes where the bromine is added to the more substituted carbon of the original double bond. The choices involve different possible products. Choice 2 suggests the formation of (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which are consistent with the Markovnikov addition of HBr to the alkene, leading to bromination at the more substituted carbon. This is a reasonable outcome for the reaction described.
