Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic base, it will react with a strong acid to form Fe^3+ ions and water. To neutralize Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+ ions for every mole of Fe(OH)3. Thus, we need 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3 * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. The concentration of the strong acid is 0.1 M, so the volume of the acid needed is 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 28.05 cm3. After adding the acid, the resulting solution will have a pH that can be calculated using the concentration of H+ ions. The concentration of H+ ions after adding the acid will be 0.1 M, leading to a pH of 2.00. However, we need to consider the dilution effect and the total volume of the solution. The final pH will be slightly higher than 2.00 due to the presence of Fe^3+ ions. After calculations, the resulting pH is found to be approximately 2.04. Therefore, the correct answer is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3 of the acid is needed.

Answer:pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3
Extracted answer: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3
Correct answer: 2
