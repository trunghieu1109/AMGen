Question: Example(question='Determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis.', choice1='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene', choice2='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene', choice3='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', choice4='4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To form a cyclohexene by RCM, one uses an 8-carbon 1,7-diene so that loss of the two terminal CH2 groups (as ethylene) closes a 6-membered ring. Mapping the substituents through ring closure shows that a chain substituent at C4 (iPr) becomes cyclo C5, and substituents at C5 and C6 (Me) become cyclo C4 and C3. Thus the required starting diene is 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.
