        "response": "To form a cyclohexene by RCM, one uses an 8-carbon 1,7-diene so that loss of the two terminal CH2 groups (as ethylene) closes a 6-membered ring. Mapping the substituents through ring closure shows that a chain substituent at C4 (iPr) becomes cyclo C5, and substituents at C5 and C6 (Me) become cyclo C4 and C3. Thus the required starting diene is 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.\n\nAnswer:D)",
