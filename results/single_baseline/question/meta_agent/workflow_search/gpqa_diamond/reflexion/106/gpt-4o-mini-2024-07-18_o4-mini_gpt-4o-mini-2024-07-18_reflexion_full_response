Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6GRO', content='The key challenge is the multiple chiral centers and tautomeric forms that can drastically alter binding. Before docking, one must enumerate all possible stereoisomers and tautomers, evaluate their relative stability and likely bioactivity based on physicochemical properties, then select the most promising forms for docking. This ensures the correct molecular forms are used in structure-based studies.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
