Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction proceeds via benzyne intermediates. From 1-bromo-2-D benzene you can eliminate either D (at C2) or H (at C6) with NaNH2. 

1) If D is eliminated (at C2), you form an unlabeled 1,2-benzyne. Attack of NH2– at either benzyne carbon gives the same unlabeled aniline (positions are equivalent on an unlabeled benzene). 

2) If H is eliminated (at C6), you form a D-containing benzyne with D at C2. Attack of NH2– can occur at C1 (giving ortho-D-aniline) or at C6 (giving meta-D-aniline). 

Thus there are 1 unlabeled aniline + 2 distinct D‐labeled anilines = 3 possible products.
