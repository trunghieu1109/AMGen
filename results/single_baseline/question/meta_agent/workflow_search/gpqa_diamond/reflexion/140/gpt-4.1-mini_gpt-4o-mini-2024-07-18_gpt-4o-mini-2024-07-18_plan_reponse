        "correct_answer": 2,
        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "1-bromobenzene-2-d can undergo nucleophilic substitution at different positions. The nucleophile can attack at the ortho, meta, and para positions relative to the deuterium, as well as replace the bromine itself. This leads to a total of 4 distinct products: one from ortho substitution, one from meta substitution, one from para substitution, and one from the replacement of the bromine. Therefore, the total number of possible organic products is 4.\n\nAnswer:A",
