Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: 1-bromobenzene-2-d can form a benzyne intermediate when treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia. The nucleophilic attack by NH2- can occur at two different positions on the benzyne, leading to two main structural isomers. The presence of deuterium does not change the number of distinct structural isomers, so the focus is on the main structural isomers formed.

Answer:D)
