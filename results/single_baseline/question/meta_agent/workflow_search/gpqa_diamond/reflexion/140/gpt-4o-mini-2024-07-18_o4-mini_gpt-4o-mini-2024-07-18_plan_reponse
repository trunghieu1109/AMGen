        "response": "The reaction proceeds via benzyne intermediates. From 1-bromo-2-D benzene you can eliminate either D (at C2) or H (at C6) with NaNH2. \n\n1) If D is eliminated (at C2), you form an unlabeled 1,2-benzyne. Attack of NH2\u2013 at either benzyne carbon gives the same unlabeled aniline (positions are equivalent on an unlabeled benzene). \n\n2) If H is eliminated (at C6), you form a D-containing benzyne with D at C2. Attack of NH2\u2013 can occur at C1 (giving ortho-D-aniline) or at C6 (giving meta-D-aniline). \n\nThus there are 1 unlabeled aniline + 2 distinct D\u2010labeled anilines = 3 possible products.\n\nAnswer:B)",
