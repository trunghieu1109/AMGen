Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To introduce regular branches using only ethylene and a dual homogeneous catalyst system, one needs a chain‐walking catalyst (e.g., certain late‐transition‐metal complexes) activated by non‐aluminum activators (e.g., borate salts). Aluminum alkyls such as MAO or TMA, which work for Ziegler or metallocene catalysts, fail to activate these chain‐walking catalysts. Combined industrial systems are not yet widely implemented, group VIa metals are not used for chain walking, and while noble metals can catalyze chain walking, the cost issue is secondary to the activator requirement.
