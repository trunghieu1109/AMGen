Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: trans-Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5–CH=CH–CHO (9 C). MeMgBr adds a CH3 to the aldehyde, giving C6H5–CH=CH–CH(OH)–CH3 (10 C). PCC oxidizes the alcohol to C6H5–CH=CH–CO–CH3 (10 C). The dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene methane ylide epoxidizes the ketone, adding one CH2, so product 3 has 11 carbons.
