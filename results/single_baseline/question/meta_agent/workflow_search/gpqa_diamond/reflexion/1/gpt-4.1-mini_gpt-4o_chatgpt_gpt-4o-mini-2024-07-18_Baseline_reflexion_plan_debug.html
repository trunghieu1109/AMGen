    <pre>Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with the structure C6H5-CH=CH-CHO, which has 9 carbon atoms. When treated with methylmagnesium bromide, a Grignard reaction occurs, adding a methyl group to the carbonyl carbon, forming a secondary alcohol. This product 1 has 10 carbon atoms. When product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), the secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone, forming product 2, which still has 10 carbon atoms. The next step involves product 2 being treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature. This reagent is known to perform a methylenation reaction, which converts the ketone into an alkene by adding a CH2 group. Therefore, product 3 will have one additional carbon atom compared to product 2, resulting in 11 carbon atoms.
