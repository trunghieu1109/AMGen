        "response": "trans-Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5\u2013CH=CH\u2013CHO (9 C). MeMgBr adds a CH3 to the aldehyde, giving C6H5\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH(OH)\u2013CH3 (10 C). PCC oxidizes the alcohol to C6H5\u2013CH=CH\u2013CO\u2013CH3 (10 C). The dimethyl(oxo)-\u03bb6-sulfaneylidene methane ylide epoxidizes the ketone, adding one CH2, so product 3 has 11 carbons.\n\nAnswer:C)",
