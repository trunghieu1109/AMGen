Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The given reaction involves an enamine, which can undergo alkylation followed by hydrolysis. The enamine (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium can be deprotonated by LDA to form an enolate, which can then react with an alkyl halide like CH3CH2I to form an alkylated intermediate. Upon hydrolysis with H3O+, the enamine is converted back to a carbonyl compound. The sequence of reagents involves deprotonation, alkylation, and hydrolysis. The correct sequence of reagents and the product formed is heptan-4-one, as the enamine is alkylated at the alpha position and then hydrolyzed to the ketone.
