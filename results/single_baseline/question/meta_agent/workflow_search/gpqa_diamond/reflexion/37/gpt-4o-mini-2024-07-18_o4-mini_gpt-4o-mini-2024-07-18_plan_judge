Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The reaction is a classic enamine alkylation: the enamine of pentan-2-one is deprotonated by LDA in DME, then alkylated with ethyl iodide, and finally hydrolyzed (H3O+) to give the alkylated ketone. Alkylation at the 3-position of pentan-2-one yields 3-ethylpentan-2-one, which is correctly named heptan-4-one when the longest chain is chosen. The correct reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. This corresponds to choice 4, i.e. D).
