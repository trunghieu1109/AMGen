            "We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ",

        "response": "To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the formation equilibria of the complexes. The formation reactions and their stability constants are: Co + SCN- -> Co(SCN), \u03b21 = 9; Co + 2SCN- -> Co(SCN)2, \u03b22 = 40; Co + 3SCN- -> Co(SCN)3, \u03b23 = 63; Co + 4SCN- -> Co(SCN)4, \u03b24 = 16. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. We calculate the concentration of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all complexes: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then [Co(SCN)2] / (total concentration of cobalt species) * 100%. After calculating, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is found to be 42.3%.\n\nAnswer:B)",
