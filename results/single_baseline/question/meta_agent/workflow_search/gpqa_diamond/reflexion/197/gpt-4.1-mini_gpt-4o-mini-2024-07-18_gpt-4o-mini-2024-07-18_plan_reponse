            "We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ",

        "response": "To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of the different cobalt complexes formed in the solution using the stability constants provided. The cobalt(II) ions can form various complexes with thiocyanate ions, and we will use the stability constants to determine the distribution of these complexes. The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the second complexation step (\u03b22). We will calculate the concentrations of all complexes formed and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.\n\nAnswer:42.3%",
