Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent huTu', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the formation equilibria of the complexes. The formation reactions and their stability constants are: Co + SCN- -> Co(SCN), β1 = 9; Co + 2SCN- -> Co(SCN)2, β2 = 40; Co + 3SCN- -> Co(SCN)3, β3 = 63; Co + 4SCN- -> Co(SCN)4, β4 = 16. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. We calculate the concentration of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all complexes: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then [Co(SCN)2] / (total concentration of cobalt species) * 100%. After calculating, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is found to be 42.3%.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
