    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Jdxp (yourself):
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of the different cobalt complexes formed in the solution. The cobalt(II) ions can form various complexes with thiocyanate ions, and we will use the stability constants provided to determine the distribution of these complexes. The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the second complexation step (β2). We will calculate the concentrations of the cobalt species and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.

42.3%

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent uEHf:
The answer provided is not correct. The calculation of the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes should take into account the stability constants and the concentrations of all species formed. The correct approach involves calculating the concentrations of all complexes formed and then determining the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration. The answer should be verified with proper calculations.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
