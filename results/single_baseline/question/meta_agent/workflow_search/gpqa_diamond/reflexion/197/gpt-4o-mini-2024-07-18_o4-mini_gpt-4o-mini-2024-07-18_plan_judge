Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the fraction of Co(SCN)2 (blue dithiocyanato complex) among all cobalt species. For stepwise cumulative stability constants β1 to β4 and [SCN-]=0.1 M:
Calculate βn·[SCN]^n:
β1·[S]=9·0.1=0.9
β2·[S]^2=40·0.01=0.4
β3·[S]^3=63·0.001=0.063
β4·[S]^4=16·0.0001=0.0016
Denominator D=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646
Fraction of Co(SCN)2 is β2[S]^2/D=0.4/2.3646≈0.169=16.9%
