Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The sequence is a Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky–type α‐bromination of cyclohexanone, base‐induced Favorskii ring contraction to give cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, conversion to the acid chloride with SOCl₂/pyridine, and selective reduction with LiAlH(OtBu)₃ to the corresponding aldehyde, cyclopentane‐1‐carbaldehyde. That product has a mirror plane through C1 (the carbaldehyde‐bearing carbon) so that: 1) the aldehyde H is unique, 2) the C1 ring H is unique, 3) the two CH₂ groups adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are related by symmetry but each CH₂ has two diastereotopic H’s, and 4) the two CH₂ groups farther away (C3 and C4) likewise each have two diastereotopic H’s. Total = 6 chemically distinct H’s.
