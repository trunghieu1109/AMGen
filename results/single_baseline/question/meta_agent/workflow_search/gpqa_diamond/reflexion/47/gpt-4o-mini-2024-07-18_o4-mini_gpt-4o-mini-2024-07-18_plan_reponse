        "response": "The sequence is a Hell\u2013Volhard\u2013Zelinsky\u2013type \u03b1\u2010bromination of cyclohexanone, base\u2010induced Favorskii ring contraction to give cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, conversion to the acid chloride with SOCl\u2082/pyridine, and selective reduction with LiAlH(OtBu)\u2083 to the corresponding aldehyde, cyclopentane\u20101\u2010carbaldehyde. That product has a mirror plane through C1 (the carbaldehyde\u2010bearing carbon) so that: 1) the aldehyde H is unique, 2) the C1 ring H is unique, 3) the two CH\u2082 groups adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are related by symmetry but each CH\u2082 has two diastereotopic H\u2019s, and 4) the two CH\u2082 groups farther away (C3 and C4) likewise each have two diastereotopic H\u2019s. Total = 6 chemically distinct H\u2019s.\n\nAnswer:B)",
