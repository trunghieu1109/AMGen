Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FTju', content='The sequence is a Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky–type α‐bromination of cyclohexanone, base‐induced Favorskii ring contraction to give cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, conversion to the acid chloride with SOCl₂/pyridine, and selective reduction with LiAlH(OtBu)₃ to the corresponding aldehyde, cyclopentane‐1‐carbaldehyde. That product has a mirror plane through C1 (the carbaldehyde‐bearing carbon) so that: 1) the aldehyde H is unique, 2) the C1 ring H is unique, 3) the two CH₂ groups adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are related by symmetry but each CH₂ has two diastereotopic H’s, and 4) the two CH₂ groups farther away (C3 and C4) likewise each have two diastereotopic H’s. Total = 6 chemically distinct H’s.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
