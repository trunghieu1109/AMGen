            "How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.",

Canopus (V\u2248\u20130.72) and Polaris (V\u22481.98) are easily detectable. For the absolute V=15 stars: at 5 pc m=13.5 (detectable), at 10 pc m=15 (borderline but meets S/N=10), at 50 pc m\u224818.5 (too faint), at 200 pc m\u224821.5 (too faint). Thus detectable are Canopus, Polaris, the 5 pc star, and the 10 pc star: 4 total.\n\nAnswer:A)",
