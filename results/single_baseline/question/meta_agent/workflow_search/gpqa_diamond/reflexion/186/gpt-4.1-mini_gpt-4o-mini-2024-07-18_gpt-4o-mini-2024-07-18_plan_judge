proposed answer: To determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star based on their absolute magnitude and distance. The formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) is: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude is bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10. Typically, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than about 15-16 mag are detectable. Let's calculate the apparent magnitudes for each star listed:

1. Canopus: Absolute V magnitude ~ -5.5, distance ~ 310 pc. 
   m = -5.5 + 5 * (log10(310) - 1) ≈ -5.5 + 5 * (2.491 - 1) ≈ -5.5 + 7.455 ≈ 1.955 (detectable)

2. Polaris: Absolute V magnitude ~ -3.6, distance ~ 433 pc. 
   m = -3.6 + 5 * (log10(433) - 1) ≈ -3.6 + 5 * (2.637 - 1) ≈ -3.6 + 8.185 ≈ 4.585 (detectable)

3. Star at 10 pc, M = 15: 
   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15 + 0 = 15 (detectable)

4. Star at 200 pc, M = 15: 
   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(200) - 1) ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301 - 1) ≈ 15 + 6.505 ≈ 21.505 (not detectable)

5. Star at 5 pc, M = 15: 
   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699 - 1) ≈ 15 - 1.505 ≈ 13.495 (detectable)

6. Star at 50 pc, M = 15: 
   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699 - 1) ≈ 15 + 3.495 ≈ 18.495 (not detectable)

From the calculations, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. Therefore, 4 stars are detectable.
