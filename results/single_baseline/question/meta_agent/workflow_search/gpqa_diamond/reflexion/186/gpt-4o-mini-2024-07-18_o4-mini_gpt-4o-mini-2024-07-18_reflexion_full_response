Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5MSv', content='We estimate ESPRESSO on one 8m UT in high-resolution mode reaches S/N~10 per pixel in 1h for stars around V~15. Canopus (V≈–0.72) and Polaris (V≈1.98) are easily detectable. For the absolute V=15 stars: at 5 pc m=13.5 (detectable), at 10 pc m=15 (borderline but meets S/N=10), at 50 pc m≈18.5 (too faint), at 200 pc m≈21.5 (too faint). Thus detectable are Canopus, Polaris, the 5 pc star, and the 10 pc star: 4 total.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
