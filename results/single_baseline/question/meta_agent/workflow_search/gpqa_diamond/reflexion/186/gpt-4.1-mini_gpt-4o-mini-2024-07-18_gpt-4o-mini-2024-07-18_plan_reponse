A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.",

        "response": "To determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star based on their absolute magnitude and distance. The formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) is: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude is bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10. Typically, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than about 15-16 mag are detectable. Let's calculate the apparent magnitudes for each star listed:\n\n1. Canopus: Absolute V magnitude ~ -5.5, distance ~ 310 pc. \n   m = -5.5 + 5 * (log10(310) - 1) \u2248 -5.5 + 5 * (2.491 - 1) \u2248 -5.5 + 7.455 \u2248 1.955 (detectable)\n\n2. Polaris: Absolute V magnitude ~ -3.6, distance ~ 433 pc. \n   m = -3.6 + 5 * (log10(433) - 1) \u2248 -3.6 + 5 * (2.637 - 1) \u2248 -3.6 + 8.185 \u2248 4.585 (detectable)\n\n3. Star at 10 pc, M = 15: \n   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15 + 0 = 15 (detectable)\n\n4. Star at 200 pc, M = 15: \n   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(200) - 1) \u2248 15 + 5 * (2.301 - 1) \u2248 15 + 6.505 \u2248 21.505 (not detectable)\n\n5. Star at 5 pc, M = 15: \n   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) \u2248 15 + 5 * (0.699 - 1) \u2248 15 - 1.505 \u2248 13.495 (detectable)\n\n6. Star at 50 pc, M = 15: \n   m = 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) \u2248 15 + 5 * (1.699 - 1) \u2248 15 + 3.495 \u2248 18.495 (not detectable)\n\nFrom the calculations, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. Therefore, 4 stars are detectable.\n\nAnswer:A",
