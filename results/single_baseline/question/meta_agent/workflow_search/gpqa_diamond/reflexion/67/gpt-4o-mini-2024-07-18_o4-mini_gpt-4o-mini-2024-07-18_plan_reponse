            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "The Hamiltonian after switching the field to the +Y direction is H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B = -\u03b3 B Sy. Starting from the initial |Sz=+\u0127/2> state, the time evolution U(t) = exp(-iHt/\u0127) = exp(i\u03b3B Sy t/\u0127) corresponds to a rotation about the y-axis by angle \u03c6 = \u03b3B t. Under this rotation, Sz evolves as Sz(t) = Sz cos(\u03b3B t) + Sx sin(\u03b3B t). The expectation \u27e8Sx\u27e9 in the initial |Sz=+> state is zero, so \u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3B t). Thus the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is \u03c9 = \u03b3B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
