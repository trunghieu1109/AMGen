Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The Hamiltonian after switching the field to the +Y direction is H = -γ S·B = -γ B Sy. Starting from the initial |Sz=+ħ/2> state, the time evolution U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(iγB Sy t/ħ) corresponds to a rotation about the y-axis by angle φ = γB t. Under this rotation, Sz evolves as Sz(t) = Sz cos(γB t) + Sx sin(γB t). The expectation ⟨Sx⟩ in the initial |Sz=+> state is zero, so ⟨Sz(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γB t). Thus the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is ω = γB.
