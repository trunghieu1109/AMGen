Question: {'question': 'There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', 'choice1': 'gamma*B/2', 'choice2': 'gamma*B', 'choice3': 'gamma*B/sqrt(2)', 'choice4': 'sqrt(2)*gamma*B'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bapV', content='When the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on in a different direction, the spin of the particle will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The frequency of precession (Larmor frequency) is given by the formula omega = gamma * B, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnetic field strength. In this case, since the magnetic field is now along the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment will be equal to the Larmor frequency for the new field direction. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma * B.\n\nAnswer:gamma*B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
