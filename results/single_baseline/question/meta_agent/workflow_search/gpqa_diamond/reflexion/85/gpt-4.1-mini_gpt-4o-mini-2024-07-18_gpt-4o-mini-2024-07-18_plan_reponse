        "response": "To determine the correct starting materials for the reactions, we need to match the stereochemistry of the products with the appropriate starting compounds. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which suggests that A must lead to the (R) product and B must lead to the (S) product. Analyzing the choices, choice 4 provides A as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which aligns with the required products.\n\nAnswer:D",
