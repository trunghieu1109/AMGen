        "response": "The lactone product is formed by intramolecular cyclization of the 5-hydroxy acid that results from reducing the ketone (LiBH4) or the acid (BH3). In each case the only stereocenter in the lactone arises from the original 3-ethyl stereocenter of the starting acid. Reaction A gives the (R)-lactone, so A must be the (R)-acid. Reaction B gives the (S)-lactone, so B must be the (S)-acid. That matches choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D",
