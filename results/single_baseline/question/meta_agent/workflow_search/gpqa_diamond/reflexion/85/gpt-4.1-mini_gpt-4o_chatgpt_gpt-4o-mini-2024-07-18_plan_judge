Question: Example(question='A chemist performed two reactions by taking two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. Select the proper starting material for both of the reactions.\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one', choice1='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice2='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice3='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice4='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The reactions involve reducing agents LiBH4 and BH3, which are known to reduce carbonyl compounds. The products are (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which suggests that the starting materials are likely to be chiral carbonyl compounds that can be reduced to these chiral lactones. LiBH4 is a selective reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols, while BH3 is known for reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product indicates the stereochemistry of the starting material. For reaction A, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, suggesting that the starting material should be the (S)-enantiomer to give the (R)-product after reduction. For reaction B, the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, suggesting that the starting material should be the (R)-enantiomer to give the (S)-product after reduction. Therefore, the correct choice is A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
