Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Step 1: A is propene (C3H6). Bromination gives B = 1,2-dibromopropane. Step 2: B + alcoholic KOH undergoes two eliminations to give C = propyne (CH3Câ‰¡CH), a flammable gas. Step 3: Passing propyne over red-hot iron causes trimerization to yield D = mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Step 4: D with mixed acids (HNO3/H2SO4) nitrates to E = 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Step 5: E reduced by Fe/HCl gives F = 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, an aryl amine used in dye synthesis. Step 6: F with nitrous acid forms diazonium G. Step 7: G + NaOH yields H = 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitol). Check statements: (1) D has one aromatic singlet (3 H) and one methyl singlet (9 H): correct. (2) F is an aromatic amine used as dye intermediate: correct. (4) C is a flammable gas: correct. (3) Mesitol (H) is hindered and does not give a typical yellow FeCl3 test: incorrect.
