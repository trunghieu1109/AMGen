    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the reaction sequence step by step. Compound A is C3H6, which is propene. Bromination of propene in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B). Reacting B with alcoholic KOH leads to dehydrohalogenation, forming propene (compound C). Passing propene through a red-hot iron tube leads to cyclopropane (compound D). Cyclopropane reacts with a mixture of strong acids (likely H2SO4 and HNO3) to form nitrocyclopropane (compound E). Nitrocyclopropane, in the presence of iron and HCl, undergoes reduction to form cyclopropylamine (compound F). Cyclopropylamine reacts with nitrous acid to form cyclopropanol (compound G). Cyclopropanol reacts with NaOH to form sodium cyclopropoxide (compound H). Now, let&#39;s evaluate the statements: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra - cyclopropane has equivalent protons, so this is incorrect. F is used for the synthesis of dyes - cyclopropylamine can be used in synthesis, so this is plausible. H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride - sodium cyclopropoxide is not phenolic, so this is incorrect. C is a flammable gas - propene is indeed a flammable gas.
