    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that can exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the sizes of the planets and their distances from the star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The radius of the star is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The maximum orbital period for the second planet can be derived from the relationship between the radius of the orbit and the period, using Kepler&#39;s third law. The second planet must be close enough to the star to transit and occult the first planet, which means we need to calculate the distance at which the second planet can orbit while still being able to transit the first planet. The calculations involve the sizes of the planets and the star, and the geometry of the transits and occultations. After performing the necessary calculations, we find that the maximum orbital period of the second planet is approximately 12.5 days.
