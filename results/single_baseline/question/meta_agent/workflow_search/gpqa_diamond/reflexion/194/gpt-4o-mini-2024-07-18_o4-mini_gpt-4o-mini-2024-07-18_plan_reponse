            "Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.",

        "response": "We require that the second planet\u2019s impact parameter b2=(a2/a1)\u00b7b1 remains below the occultation limit b_max_occ=1\u2013Rp/R*. Here Rp/R*=(2.5\u2009R\u2295)/(1.5\u2009R\u2299)=2.5\u00b70.00916/1.5\u22480.0153, so b_max_occ\u22480.9847. Given b1=0.2, we have a2/a1\u22640.9847/0.2\u22484.9235. Then P scales as a3/2, so P2_max=3\u2009d\u00b7(4.9235)3/2\u22483\u00b710.92\u224832.8\u2009d, i.e. ~33.5\u2009d.\n\nAnswer:B)",
