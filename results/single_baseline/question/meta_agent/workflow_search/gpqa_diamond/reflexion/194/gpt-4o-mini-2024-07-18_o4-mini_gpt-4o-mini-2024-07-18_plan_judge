Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We require that the second planet’s impact parameter b2=(a2/a1)·b1 remains below the occultation limit b_max_occ=1–Rp/R*. Here Rp/R*=(2.5 R⊕)/(1.5 R⊙)=2.5·0.00916/1.5≈0.0153, so b_max_occ≈0.9847. Given b1=0.2, we have a2/a1≤0.9847/0.2≈4.9235. Then P scales as a3/2, so P2_max=3 d·(4.9235)3/2≈3·10.92≈32.8 d, i.e. ~33.5 d.
