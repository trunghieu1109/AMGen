Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r for small angles. Therefore, we can express the relationship as follows: if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. Substituting this into the original relationship gives us the number of stars as proportional to r^5. Since the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can rewrite it as (r^5) when substituting for plx. Thus, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.
