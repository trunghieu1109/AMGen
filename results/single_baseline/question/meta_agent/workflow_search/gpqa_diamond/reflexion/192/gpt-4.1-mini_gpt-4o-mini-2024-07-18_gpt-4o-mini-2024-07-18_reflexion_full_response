Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent z5bL', content='The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r for small angles. Therefore, we can express the relationship as follows: if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. Substituting this into the original relationship gives us the number of stars as proportional to r^5. Since the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can rewrite it as (r^5) when substituting for plx. Thus, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
