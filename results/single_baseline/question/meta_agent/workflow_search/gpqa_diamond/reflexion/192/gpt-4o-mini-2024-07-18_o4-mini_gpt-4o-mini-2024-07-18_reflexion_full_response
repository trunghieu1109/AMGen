Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent tYfy', content='Step 1: Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r, so plx ∝ 1/r.\nStep 2: The observed distribution is dN/d(plx) ∝ plx^(–5).\nStep 3: To convert to dN/dr, use dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·(d(plx)/dr). Since plx = k/r, d(plx)/dr = –k/r^2 ∝ –1/r^2.\nStep 4: Thus dN/dr ∝ plx^(–5)·(1/r^2). Substituting plx ∝ 1/r gives ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3.\nConclusion: The number of stars per unit distance varies as r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
