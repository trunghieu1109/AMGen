Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Step 1: Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r, so plx ∝ 1/r.
Step 2: The observed distribution is dN/d(plx) ∝ plx^(–5).
Step 3: To convert to dN/dr, use dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·(d(plx)/dr). Since plx = k/r, d(plx)/dr = –k/r^2 ∝ –1/r^2.
Step 4: Thus dN/dr ∝ plx^(–5)·(1/r^2). Substituting plx ∝ 1/r gives ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3.
Conclusion: The number of stars per unit distance varies as r^3.
