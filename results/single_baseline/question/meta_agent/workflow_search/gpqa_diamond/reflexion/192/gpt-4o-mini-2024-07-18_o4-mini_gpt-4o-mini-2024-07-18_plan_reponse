        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "Step 1: Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r, so plx \u221d 1/r.\nStep 2: The observed distribution is dN/d(plx) \u221d plx^(\u20135).\nStep 3: To convert to dN/dr, use dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))\u00b7(d(plx)/dr). Since plx = k/r, d(plx)/dr = \u2013k/r^2 \u221d \u20131/r^2.\nStep 4: Thus dN/dr \u221d plx^(\u20135)\u00b7(1/r^2). Substituting plx \u221d 1/r gives \u221d r^5\u00b7(1/r^2) = r^3.\nConclusion: The number of stars per unit distance varies as r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
