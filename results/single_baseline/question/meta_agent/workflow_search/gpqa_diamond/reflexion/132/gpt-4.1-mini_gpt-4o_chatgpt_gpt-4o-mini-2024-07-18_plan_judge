Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we need to consider the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. The dissociation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is governed by the equilibrium constant Ka3. We have the concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- from the initial moles and volume. The concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the equilibrium expression: [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+]. However, in a buffer system, the concentration of H+ is determined by the pH of the solution, which is influenced by the ratio of H2PO4- to HPO4^2-. Assuming the pH is such that the concentration of H+ is low, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately [HPO4^2-] * Ka3. Calculating this gives a very low concentration, but the closest choice to this calculated concentration is 5.48x10^-7 M.
