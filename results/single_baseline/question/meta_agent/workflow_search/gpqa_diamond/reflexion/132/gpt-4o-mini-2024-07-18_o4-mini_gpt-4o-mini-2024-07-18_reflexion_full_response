Question: {'question': 'We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zxJu', content='First, calculate moles: KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol → [H2PO4–]0 = 0.007345/0.200 L = 0.03672 M. Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol → [HPO42–]0 = 0.005618/0.200 L = 0.02809 M. pH from Henderson–Hasselbalch for H2PO4–/HPO42–: pKa2 = –log(6.2×10–8) = 7.207; pH = 7.207 + log(0.02809/0.03672) = 7.091. Then [PO43–]/[HPO42–] = Ka3/[H+] = 1.8×10–12 / (10–7.091 = 8.13×10–8) = 2.214×10–5. So [PO43–] = 0.02809×2.214×10–5 = 6.22×10–7 M ≈ 6.24×10–7 M.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
