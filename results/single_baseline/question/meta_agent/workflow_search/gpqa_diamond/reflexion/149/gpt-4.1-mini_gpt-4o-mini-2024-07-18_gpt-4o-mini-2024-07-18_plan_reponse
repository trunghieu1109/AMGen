        "response": "The molecular formula C8H9NO indicates a compound with an amine group. The NMR data shows multiple aromatic protons and suggests the presence of a phenolic structure. The reaction sequence starts with diazotization, which typically leads to the formation of a diazonium salt. The subsequent hydrolysis and heating with KOH could lead to the formation of a phenolic compound. Analyzing the choices, I need to identify which product corresponds to the expected transformations based on the NMR data and the reagents used.\n\nAnswer:2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal",
