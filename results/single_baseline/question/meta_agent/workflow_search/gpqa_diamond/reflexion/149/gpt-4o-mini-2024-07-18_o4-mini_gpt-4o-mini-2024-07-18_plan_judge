Question: Example(question='A compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and the given NMR data is reacted with the following set of reagents:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl\n2. H2O\n3. aq. KOH, Heat \n\n1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Identify the final product.', choice1='4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal', choice2='3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal', choice3='2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal', choice4='2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The starting compound C8H9NO with NMR signals at 9.72 t (CHO), 3.66 d (CH2), two aromatic doublets (2H each) and two OH’s fits p-aminophenylacetaldehyde. NaNO2/HCl then H2O converts the NH2 to OH giving p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Treatment with KOH/heat induces a self-aldol (base-catalyzed) condensation of two molecules of RCH2CHO (R = p-hydroxyphenyl) to give RCH2CH=CHCHO, i.e. 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.
