Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent GPoM', content='First, convert the absorption line energy to frequency: E = 3.9×10⁻⁶ eV = 6.25×10⁻²⁵ J, so ν = E/h ≈ 6.25×10⁻²⁵ J / 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s ≈ 0.94 GHz. This corresponds to a radio line near 32 cm, which when redshifted back (z~0.5) matches the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (1.42 GHz, 5.9×10⁻⁶ eV). In the Milky Way, 21 cm absorption is predominantly seen in the cold atomic (HI) medium against background radio sources, because warm HI has higher spin temperature and generally appears in emission rather than absorption.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
