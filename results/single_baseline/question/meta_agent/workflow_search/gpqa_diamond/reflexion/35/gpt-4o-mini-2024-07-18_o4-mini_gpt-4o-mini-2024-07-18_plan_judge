Question: Example(question='Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?', choice1='Cold molecular interstellar medium.', choice2='Cold atomic interstellar medium.', choice3='Warm atomic interstellar medium.', choice4='Warm molecular interstellar medium.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, convert the absorption line energy to frequency: E = 3.9×10⁻⁶ eV = 6.25×10⁻²⁵ J, so ν = E/h ≈ 6.25×10⁻²⁵ J / 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s ≈ 0.94 GHz. This corresponds to a radio line near 32 cm, which when redshifted back (z~0.5) matches the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (1.42 GHz, 5.9×10⁻⁶ eV). In the Milky Way, 21 cm absorption is predominantly seen in the cold atomic (HI) medium against background radio sources, because warm HI has higher spin temperature and generally appears in emission rather than absorption.
