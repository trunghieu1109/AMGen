Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, we need to consider the possible decay channels that are allowed by energy conservation and the mass of the decay products. The decay products must have a combined mass that is less than or equal to 6 GeV. The decay channels involving quarks and leptons must be checked against their respective masses. The lightest quark-antiquark pairs (like u, d, s, c) and lepton pairs (like e, mu, tau) can be produced if their combined mass is less than 6 GeV. The heaviest pair, t\bar{t}, cannot be produced since the top quark mass is around 173 GeV, which exceeds 6 GeV. Therefore, we will analyze the provided choices to see which decay channels are valid.

Answer:The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are: X\rightarrow c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}.
