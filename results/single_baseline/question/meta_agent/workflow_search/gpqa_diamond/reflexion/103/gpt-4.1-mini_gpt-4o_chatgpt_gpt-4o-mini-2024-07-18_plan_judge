Question: Example(question='Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', choice1='~ 0.36', choice2='~ 1.40', choice3='~ 1.96', choice4='~ 0.85', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectrum of the star caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to the velocity of the star (v) by the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where λ is the original wavelength and c is the speed of light. The velocity of the star is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period by Kepler's laws. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the velocity of the star is inversely proportional to the orbital period of the planet. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is inversely proportional to the ratio of the wavelength shifts. For planet #1, the shift is 5 miliangstroms, and for planet #2, it is 7 miliangstroms. Thus, the ratio of the orbital periods is 5/7.
