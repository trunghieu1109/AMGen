Question: Example(question='Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', choice1='~ 0.36', choice2='~ 1.40', choice3='~ 1.96', choice4='~ 0.85', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We have two stars of equal mass (like the Sun) each hosting a Neptune-mass planet in a circular orbit. The radial velocity amplitude K for each planet is given by the Doppler shift: Δλ/λ = v/c, so K ∝ Δλ. For circular orbits and equal stellar and planet masses, K = (2πG/P)^{1/3} (m_p/M_star^{2/3}), so K ∝ P^{-1/3}. With the same m_p and M_star, we have K ∝ P^{-1/3}, hence P ∝ K^{-3}. Given K1∝5 mÅ and K2∝7 mÅ, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364 ≈ 0.36.
