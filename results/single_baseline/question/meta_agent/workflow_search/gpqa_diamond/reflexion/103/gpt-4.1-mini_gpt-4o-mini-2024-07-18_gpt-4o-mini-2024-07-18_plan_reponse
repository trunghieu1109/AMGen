            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "response": "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can use the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) method and the orbital period of the planets. The amplitude of the periodic shift in the spectral line is related to the mass of the planet and the distance from the star. Since both stars have similar masses and both planets have similar masses, we can use the ratio of the shifts to find the ratio of the orbital periods. The shift for planet #1 is 5 miliangstrom and for planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom. The ratio of the shifts is 7/5, which can be related to the ratio of the orbital periods. The orbital period is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the shift, so if the shift for planet #2 is larger, its orbital period will be longer. Therefore, we can calculate the ratio of the periods as follows: T2/T1 = (5/7). This means T2 is longer than T1 by a factor of 7/5, which is approximately 1.4. Thus, the answer is that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 1.40 times longer than that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer:B",
