Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The transcription factor requires dimerization to function properly. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative mutation, which means it interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. A dominant-negative mutation often results in the mutant protein forming non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. This is because the mutant protein can still bind to the wild-type protein but prevents it from functioning correctly. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is one where the mutant protein interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.
