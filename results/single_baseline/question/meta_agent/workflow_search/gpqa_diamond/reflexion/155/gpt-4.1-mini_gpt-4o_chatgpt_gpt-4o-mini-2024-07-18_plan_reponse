            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, forming an epoxide, which is then opened with aqueous acid to form a diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly, forming a different epoxide, which is also opened to form a diol. The (E)-alkene will form a meso diol, while the (Z)-alkene will form a pair of enantiomers. On a standard HPLC, the meso compound and the racemic mixture will not be resolved, resulting in 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomers will be resolved, resulting in 3 peaks (one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers).\n\nAnswer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC",
