            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "The epoxidation of a trans (E) disubstituted alkene proceeds by syn addition on both faces to give a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides (chiral). The epoxidation of a cis (Z) alkene gives a single meso epoxide (achiral). When the products are mixed, there are three distinct compounds: two enantiomers (from the E-alkene) and one meso isomer (from the Z-alkene). On an achiral (standard) HPLC column, enantiomers coelute as one peak, and the meso compound elutes separately, giving 2 peaks. On a chiral column, the enantiomers are resolved into two peaks, and the meso isomer remains a single peak, giving 3 peaks.\n\nAnswer:C)",
