Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent LUvq', content='Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, forming an epoxide, which is then opened with aqueous acid to form a diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly, forming a different epoxide, which is also opened to form a diol. The (E)-alkene will form a meso diol, while the (Z)-alkene will form a pair of enantiomers. On a standard HPLC, the meso compound and the racemic mixture will not be resolved, resulting in 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomers will be resolved, resulting in 3 peaks (one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers).\n\nAnswer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
