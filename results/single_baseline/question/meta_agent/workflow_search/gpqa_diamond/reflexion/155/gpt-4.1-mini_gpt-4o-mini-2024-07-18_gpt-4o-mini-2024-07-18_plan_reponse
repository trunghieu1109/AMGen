            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis, leading to the formation of a ketone and an alcohol. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes the same process, resulting in different products. The (E) and (Z) isomers yield different stereoisomers. When combined, the products will include both enantiomers from the (E) and (Z) isomers. In standard HPLC, which does not differentiate between enantiomers, we expect to see 2 distinct peaks (one for each product type). In chiral HPLC, we can separate the enantiomers, leading to 4 distinct peaks (two for each product type). Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:3",
