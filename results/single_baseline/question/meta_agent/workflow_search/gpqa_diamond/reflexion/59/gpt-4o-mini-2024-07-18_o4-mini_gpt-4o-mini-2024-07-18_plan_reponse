            "An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?",

        "response": "The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160 000 light-years away. At v=0.99999987 c, the Lorentz factor \u03b3\u22481/\u221a(1\u2013v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\u22481/\u221a(2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2077)\u22481960. The travel time in the rest frame is t=L/v\u2248160 000 ly/\u2248c\u2248160 000 yr, so the astronaut\u2019s proper time is \u03c4=t/\u03b3\u2248160 000 yr/1960\u224882 yr, which is closest to 81 yr.\n\nAnswer:D",
