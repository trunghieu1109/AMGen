Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to calculate the time dilation effect due to traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). Here, v = 0.99999987 * c. This results in a very high Lorentz factor, indicating that time will pass much slower for the astronaut compared to an observer on Earth. We need to find the time it takes to travel to Earth at that speed and then apply the time dilation to find the astronaut's experience. Given the options, we can estimate that the astronaut will experience significantly less time than the total travel time, which is likely to be more than 72 years from an external perspective. Therefore, the astronaut will experience a time that is less than the total travel time, making the option 'The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth' unlikely. The most reasonable choice based on the relativistic effects is 72 years, as it suggests the astronaut will survive the journey.
