            "Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$",

        "response": "We have a spin-1 system with P_z eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127. The state in the P_z basis is \u03c8 = (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2)^T, normalized. Compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = \u0127(1\u00b71/4 + 0\u00b71/2 + (-1)\u00b71/4) = 0. Then \u27e8P_z^2\u27e9 = \u0127^2(1^2\u00b71/4 + 0^2\u00b71/2 + 1^2\u00b71/4) = \u0127^2/2. Thus \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z^2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9^2) = \u0127/\u221a2, corresponding to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
