            "Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$",

        "response": "To find the uncertainty \u0394P_z of the operator P_z, we need to calculate the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and the expectation value of the square \u27e8P_z^2\u27e9. The uncertainty is given by the formula \u0394P_z = \u221a(\u27e8P_z^2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). The state of the system is given by the column vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2), which we will denote as |\u03c8\u27e9. We will first compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and then \u27e8P_z^2\u27e9 using the matrix representation of P_z and the state |\u03c8\u27e9. The matrix for P_z is [[\u210f, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\u210f]]. Calculating \u27e8P_z\u27e9 involves taking the inner product |\u03c8\u27e9\u2020 P_z |\u03c8\u27e9. The result will give us the expectation value. Then, we will compute \u27e8P_z^2\u27e9, which is simply \u210f\u00b2 for the eigenvalues of P_z. Finally, we will substitute these values into the uncertainty formula to find \u0394P_z.\n\nAnswer:\u210f/2",
