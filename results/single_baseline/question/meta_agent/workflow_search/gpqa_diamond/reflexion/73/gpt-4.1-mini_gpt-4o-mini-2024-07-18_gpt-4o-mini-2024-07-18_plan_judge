Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes, which means the survival probability is 68%. After 50 minutes without decay, we need to find the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. The total time we are considering is 200 minutes (50 minutes already passed + 150 minutes to come). We need to calculate the probability of surviving the next 150 minutes and then subtract that from 1 to find the decay probability. The survival probability over 200 minutes can be calculated using the exponential decay model, where the decay constant can be derived from the 32% decay probability over 100 minutes. This will give us a more accurate probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.
