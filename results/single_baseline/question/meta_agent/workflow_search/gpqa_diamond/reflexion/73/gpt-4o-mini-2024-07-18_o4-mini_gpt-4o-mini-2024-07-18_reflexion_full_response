Question: {'question': 'We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', 'choice1': '52%', 'choice2': '48%', 'choice3': '44%', 'choice4': '40%'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cZcI', content='We have an exponential decay with memoryless property. Given P(decay within 100 min)=0.32, so exp(-100/τ)=0.68. Thus τ=-100/ln(0.68). The probability to decay in next 150 min is 1 - exp(-150/τ) = 1 - (exp(-100/τ))^(1.5) = 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393 ≈ 44%.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
