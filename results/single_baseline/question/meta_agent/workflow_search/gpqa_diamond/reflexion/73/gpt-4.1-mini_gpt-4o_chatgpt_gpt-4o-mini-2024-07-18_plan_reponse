            "We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ",

        "response": "We are given that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. This means the probability of the atom not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%. We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. We can use the exponential decay model, where the probability of decay in time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. We know P(100) = 0.32, so 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.32, which gives e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Therefore, -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Now, we want the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. This is given by the conditional probability P(decay in 150 minutes | no decay in 50 minutes) = P(decay in 200 minutes) / P(no decay in 50 minutes). We have P(decay in 200 minutes) = 1 - e^(-200\u03bb) and P(no decay in 50 minutes) = e^(-50\u03bb). Therefore, the probability is (1 - e^(-200\u03bb)) / e^(-50\u03bb). We have e^(-200\u03bb) = (e^(-100\u03bb))^2 = 0.68^2 and e^(-50\u03bb) = sqrt(e^(-100\u03bb)) = sqrt(0.68). So the probability is (1 - 0.68^2) / sqrt(0.68). Calculating this gives approximately 0.52 or 52%.\n\nAnswer:A)",
