            "We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ",

The probability to decay in next 150 min is 1 - exp(-150/\u03c4) = 1 - (exp(-100/\u03c4))^(1.5) = 1 - 0.68^1.5 \u2248 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393 \u2248 44%.\n\nAnswer:C)",
