Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have an exponential decay with memoryless property. Given P(decay within 100 min)=0.32, so exp(-100/τ)=0.68. Thus τ=-100/ln(0.68). The probability to decay in next 150 min is 1 - exp(-150/τ) = 1 - (exp(-100/τ))^(1.5) = 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393 ≈ 44%.
