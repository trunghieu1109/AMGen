            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.",

        "response": "The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers, which is indicative of an O-H stretch, suggesting the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a C=C double bond. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which could correspond to a common fragment like CH3COOH (acetic acid) or similar. Considering these data, the compound likely contains both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond, and possibly an O-H group. The presence of vinyl hydrogens and a carbonyl group suggests a compound with both unsaturation and a carbonyl. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. C6H10O2 fits the data as it can have a carbonyl group, a C=C double bond, and an O-H group, possibly as a carboxylic acid.\n\nAnswer:A)",
