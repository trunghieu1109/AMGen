            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.",

        "response": "To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the provided spectral data. The broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers in the FTIR suggests the presence of O-H or N-H groups, indicating possible alcohols or acids. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers suggest the presence of carbonyl (C=O) groups, which could indicate ketones or esters. The presence of vinyl-hydrogens in the 1H NMR suggests unsaturation, likely indicating double bonds. The mass spectrum fragment peak at m/z = 45 could correspond to an acyloxy group or a small fragment from a larger molecule. Considering all these factors, the compound is likely to be an unsaturated compound with a carbonyl group and possibly an alcohol or acid. Among the choices, C6H10O2 fits best as it can account for the carbonyl and the broad O-H peak, while also being consistent with the unsaturation indicated by the vinyl-hydrogens. Therefore, the most likely chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\nAnswer:C6H10O2",
