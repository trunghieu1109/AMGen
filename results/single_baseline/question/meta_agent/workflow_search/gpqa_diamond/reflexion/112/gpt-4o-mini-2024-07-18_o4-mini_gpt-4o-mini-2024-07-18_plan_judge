Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The broad 3000 cm–1 band indicates an O–H stretch (likely carboxylic acid). The strong 1700 cm–1 is a C=O stretch, and the 1650 cm–1 band plus vinyl proton signals in the 1H NMR indicate C=C. A fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to [CH3CO]+, consistent with an acyl fragment from a carboxylic acid. Of the options, only C6H10O2 fits an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid (one C=O, one OH, one C=C).
