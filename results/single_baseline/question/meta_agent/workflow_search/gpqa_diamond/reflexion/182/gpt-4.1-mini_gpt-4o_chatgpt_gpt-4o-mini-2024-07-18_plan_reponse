        "response": "The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The given compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond), a vinyl group (1 double bond), a formyl group (1 double bond), and a carboxylic acid group (1 double bond). This gives an initial IHD of 5. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the double bonds and functional groups are reduced, typically resulting in a saturated hydrocarbon. The product would be a cyclohexane derivative with no double bonds or rings broken, resulting in an IHD of 1 (for the ring).\n\nAnswer:1",
