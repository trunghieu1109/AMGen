Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We start with 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (10 carbons) having one ring, two C=C bonds (one in the ring at C3–C4 and one in the vinyl substituent), plus two oxy‐functionalities (CHO and COOH). Red P/HI is a deoxygenative reagent that reduces C=O groups (CHO → CH3 and COOH → CH3) but leaves C=C bonds intact. Thus the product is a cyclohexene (one ring + one C=C in the ring) bearing a vinyl substituent (one more C=C), i.e. 3 units of unsaturation. IHD = rings + double bonds = 1 + 2 = 3, corresponding to choice B).
