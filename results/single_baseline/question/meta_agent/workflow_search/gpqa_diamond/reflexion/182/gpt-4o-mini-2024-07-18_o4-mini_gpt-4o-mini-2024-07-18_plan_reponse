        "response": "We start with 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (10 carbons) having one ring, two C=C bonds (one in the ring at C3\u2013C4 and one in the vinyl substituent), plus two oxy\u2010functionalities (CHO and COOH). Red P/HI is a deoxygenative reagent that reduces C=O groups (CHO \u2192 CH3 and COOH \u2192 CH3) but leaves C=C bonds intact. Thus the product is a cyclohexene (one ring + one C=C in the ring) bearing a vinyl substituent (one more C=C), i.e. 3 units of unsaturation. IHD = rings + double bonds = 1 + 2 = 3, corresponding to choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
