proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}(dx^2 + dy^2). This is a conformal metric in the plane. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we need to integrate the area element over the region defined by the metric. The area element in this metric is given by dA = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)} dx dy. The region of integration is the disk defined by x^2 + y^2 < 4, since the metric becomes singular at x^2 + y^2 = 4. We convert to polar coordinates: x = r cos(\theta), y = r sin(\theta), with the Jacobian r. The area integral becomes \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{(4-r^2)} r dr d\theta. The integral over \theta is straightforward, giving a factor of 2\pi. The remaining integral is \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{(4-r^2)} dr. This can be solved by substitution: let u = 4 - r^2, then du = -2r dr, and the limits change from r=0 to u=4, and r=2 to u=0. The integral becomes -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} du = 16 \ln(u) \bigg|_4^0 = 16 (\ln(4) - \ln(0)). The integral diverges as u approaches 0, indicating the area is infinite.
