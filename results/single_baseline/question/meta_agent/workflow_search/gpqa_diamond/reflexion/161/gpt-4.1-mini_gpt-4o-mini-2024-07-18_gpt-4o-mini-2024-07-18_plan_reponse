The metric suggests a transformation that relates to the geometry of the pseudosphere. The area can be computed using the formula for the area in terms of the metric. The area of a pseudosphere is known to be infinite due to its hyperbolic nature. Therefore, the correct choice is +\u221e.\n\nAnswer:A",
