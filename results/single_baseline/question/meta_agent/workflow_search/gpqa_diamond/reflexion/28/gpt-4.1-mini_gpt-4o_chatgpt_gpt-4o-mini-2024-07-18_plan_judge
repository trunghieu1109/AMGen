Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that likely disrupts the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. The gene's function can be disrupted by introducing a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation that alters the reading frame. Let's analyze the mutations:

1. Mutant 1: The sequence changes from 'TTT' to 'TTC'. This is a synonymous mutation (both code for phenylalanine) and will not affect the protein function.

2. Mutant 2: The sequence changes from 'TTT' to 'TTA'. This is a missense mutation (phenylalanine to leucine), which might affect protein function but does not guarantee a loss of function.

3. Mutant 3: The sequence changes from 'TTT' to 'TAC'. This is a missense mutation (phenylalanine to tyrosine), which might affect protein function but does not guarantee a loss of function.

4. Mutant 4: The sequence changes from 'TTT' to 'TAC', and the sequence is shorter, indicating a possible frameshift or early stop. This is likely to disrupt the protein function significantly.

Mutant 4 seems to have a frameshift or early stop, which is most likely to eliminate the function of the gene responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.
