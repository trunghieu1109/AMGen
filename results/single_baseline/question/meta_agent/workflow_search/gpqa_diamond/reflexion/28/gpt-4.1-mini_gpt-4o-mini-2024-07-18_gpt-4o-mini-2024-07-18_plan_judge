Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the changes in the first exon of the gene. The intact gene starts with 'ATGTTT', which is the start codon and part of the coding sequence. Each mutant has a different change in this region. Mutant 1 has a change from 'TTT' to 'TAC', Mutant 2 has a change from 'TTT' to 'TAA', Mutant 3 has a change from 'TTT' to 'TTT' (no change), and Mutant 4 has a change from 'TTT' to 'TTT' (no change). The most significant change that could potentially lead to a loss of function of the anti-nutritional compound would be a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. Mutant 2 introduces a 'TAA', which is a stop codon, while Mutant 1 introduces 'TAC', which codes for Tyrosine. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by creating a premature stop codon.

Answer:Mutant 2
