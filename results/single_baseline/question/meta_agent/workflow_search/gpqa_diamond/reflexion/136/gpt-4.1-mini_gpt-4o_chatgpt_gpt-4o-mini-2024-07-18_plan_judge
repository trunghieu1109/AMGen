Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to consider the energy gained per revolution and the total energy required. The proton is accelerated by the alternating voltage U(t) each time it crosses the gap. The energy gained per crossing is 2 * U0 * cos(Φ0) because the proton crosses the gap twice per revolution. Given U0 = 190 kV and Φ0 = π/4, the energy gained per crossing is 2 * 190 kV * cos(π/4) = 2 * 190 kV * √2/2 = 190√2 kV. The total energy required is T1 = 950 MeV = 950,000 keV. The number of revolutions is the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution: 950,000 keV / (190√2 kV) = 950,000 / (190√2) revolutions. Calculating this gives approximately 3536 revolutions.
