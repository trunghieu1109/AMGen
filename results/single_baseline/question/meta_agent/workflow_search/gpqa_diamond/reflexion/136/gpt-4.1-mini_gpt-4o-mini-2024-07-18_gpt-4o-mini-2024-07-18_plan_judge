Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the total energy gained by the proton and relate it to the frequency of the alternating voltage. The kinetic energy gained is given as T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage U0 = 190 kV will accelerate the proton. The energy gained per revolution can be calculated using the relationship between energy, charge, and voltage. The charge of a proton is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 C. The total energy gained by the proton can be calculated as the product of the charge and the voltage. The number of revolutions can then be found by dividing the total energy gained by the energy gained per revolution. The frequency of the alternating voltage is related to the revolution frequency of the proton in the cyclotron, which can be calculated from the parameters given. After performing the calculations, we can determine the correct number of revolutions from the provided choices.
