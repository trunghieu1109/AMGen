Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1XVD', content='In a synchrocyclotron with two accelerating gaps, each revolution the proton gains ΔT = 2·e·U₀·cos\u2009φ₀. Given U₀ = 190\u2009kV and φ₀ = π/4, cos\u2009φ₀ = √2/2 ≈ 0.707. Thus ΔT ≈ 2·190\u2009keV·0.707 ≈ 268.7\u2009keV per turn. To reach T₁ = 950\u2009MeV = 950000\u2009keV requires N = 950000\u2009keV / 268.7\u2009keV ≈ 3538 revolutions, which rounds to 3536.\n\nAnswer:C', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
