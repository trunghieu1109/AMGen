            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group. The FTIR confirms the ester group. The 1H NMR shows six signals: two aromatic-H, two vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two \u2013CH3 groups. There are no \u2013CH2 groups. The presence of two vinyl-H suggests a vinyl group (CH=CH2) and the two \u2013CH3 groups suggest two methyl groups. The aromatic ring accounts for C6H4, the ester group for C=O and O, and the vinyl group for C2H2. The two methyl groups add C2H6. Adding these, we get C12H14O2.\n\nAnswer:C12H14O2",
