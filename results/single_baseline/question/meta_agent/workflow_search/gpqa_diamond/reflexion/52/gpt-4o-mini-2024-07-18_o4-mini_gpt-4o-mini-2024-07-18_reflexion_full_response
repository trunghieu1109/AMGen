Question: {'question': 'You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', 'choice1': 'C12H14O2', 'choice2': 'C12H12O2', 'choice3': 'C11H14O2', 'choice4': 'C11H12O2'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VJqQ', content='The two aromatic signals indicate a symmetrical para‐disubstituted benzene (4 H total). The vinyl region shows one doublet (trans‐CH=) and one doublet of quartets (CH= coupling to trans‐H and a CH3), consistent with CH=CH–CH3. The ester IR and a singlet methyl for COOCH3 plus the CH3 of CH=CH–CH3 give two methyl signals and no CH2. Summing ring (C6H4), ester side chain CH=CH–COOCH3 (C4H5O2) and a methyl substituent (C1H3) gives C11H12O2.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
