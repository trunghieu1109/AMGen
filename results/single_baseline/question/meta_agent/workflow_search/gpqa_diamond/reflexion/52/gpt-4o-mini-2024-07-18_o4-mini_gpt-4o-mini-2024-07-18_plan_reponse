            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "n": "Baseline reflexion",
        "response": "The two aromatic signals indicate a symmetrical para\u2010disubstituted benzene (4 H total). The vinyl region shows one doublet (trans\u2010CH=) and one doublet of quartets (CH= coupling to trans\u2010H and a CH3), consistent with CH=CH\u2013CH3. The ester IR and a singlet methyl for COOCH3 plus the CH3 of CH=CH\u2013CH3 give two methyl signals and no CH2. Summing ring (C6H4), ester side chain CH=CH\u2013COOCH3 (C4H5O2) and a methyl substituent (C1H3) gives C11H12O2.\n\nAnswer:D)",
