            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "To determine the correct chemical formula, we analyze the information given. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which suggests it has a benzene ring with two substituents. The presence of an ester group indicates that there is a carbonyl (C=O) and an alkoxy (\u2013O\u2013R) group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons (indicating a double bond), and two for methyl groups (\u2013CH3). The absence of \u2013CH2 signals suggests that there are no methylene groups present. This information helps us deduce the number of carbons and hydrogens in the compound. The total number of protons from the signals indicates that the compound likely has 12 hydrogens. The presence of the ester group and the structure of the aromatic ring suggests that the compound is likely to have 12 carbons as well. Therefore, the most fitting formula is C12H12O2, which accounts for the aromatic structure, the ester group, and the number of protons observed in the NMR spectrum.\n\nAnswer:C12H12O2",
