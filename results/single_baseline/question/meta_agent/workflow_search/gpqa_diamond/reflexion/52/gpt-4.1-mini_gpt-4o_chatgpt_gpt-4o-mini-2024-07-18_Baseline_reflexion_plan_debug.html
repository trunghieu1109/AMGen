    <pre>The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group. The FTIR confirms the ester group. The 1H NMR shows six signals: two aromatic-H, two vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. There are no –CH2 groups. The presence of two vinyl-H suggests a vinyl group (CH=CH2) and the two –CH3 groups suggest two methyl groups. The aromatic ring accounts for C6H4, the ester group for C=O and O, and the vinyl group for C2H2. The two methyl groups add C2H6. Adding these, we get C12H14O2.

Answer:C12H14O2</pre>
