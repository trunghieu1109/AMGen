Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Maxwell’s equations without monopoles are:
1) div·E = ρ/ε₀
2) div·B = 0
3) curl·E = -∂B/∂t
4) curl·B = μ₀ j + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Introducing magnetic monopoles (magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density j_m) modifies Gauss’s law for magnetism (div·B ≠ 0 but = μ₀ρ_m) and Faraday’s law (curl·E gets an extra -j_m term). The other two equations remain structurally the same. Hence the changed equations are the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E.
