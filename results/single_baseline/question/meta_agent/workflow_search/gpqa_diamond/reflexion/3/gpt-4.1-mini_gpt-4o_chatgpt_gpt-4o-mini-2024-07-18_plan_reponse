        "response": "In our universe, Maxwell's equations include Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (div B = 0), implying there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to div B = \u03c1_m, where \u03c1_m is the magnetic charge density. Additionally, the curl of the magnetic field equation (Faraday's law of induction) might also be affected if magnetic monopoles exist, as it would include a term related to the rate of change of magnetic charge density. Therefore, the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be different.\n\nAnswer:B)",
