        "response": "The question asks which Maxwell equations change if isolated magnetic monopoles exist. Normally, Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B=0) would acquire a source term (\u2207\u00b7B=\u03c1_m). Also Faraday\u2019s law (\u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\u2202B/\u2202t) would pick up a magnetic current term (\u2212J_m). Those correspond to the divergence of B equation and the circulation of the electric field equation. That is choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C",
