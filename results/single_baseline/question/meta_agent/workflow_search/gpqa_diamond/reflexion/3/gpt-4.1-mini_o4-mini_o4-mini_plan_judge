Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question asks which Maxwell equations change if isolated magnetic monopoles exist. Normally, Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) would acquire a source term (∇·B=ρ_m). Also Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t) would pick up a magnetic current term (−J_m). Those correspond to the divergence of B equation and the circulation of the electric field equation. That is choice 3.
