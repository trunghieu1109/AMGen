        "response": "In a universe where isolated magnetic poles exist, the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero, as it is in our universe where magnetic monopoles do not exist. This means that the equation related to the divergence of the magnetic field would change. Additionally, the presence of magnetic monopoles would likely affect the curl of the magnetic field as well. Therefore, the equations that would be different are those related to both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.\n\nAnswer:B",
