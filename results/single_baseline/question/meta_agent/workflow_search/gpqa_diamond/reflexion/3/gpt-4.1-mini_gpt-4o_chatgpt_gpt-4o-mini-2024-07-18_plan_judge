Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In our universe, Maxwell's equations include Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (div B = 0), implying there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to div B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Additionally, the curl of the magnetic field equation (Faraday's law of induction) might also be affected if magnetic monopoles exist, as it would include a term related to the rate of change of magnetic charge density. Therefore, the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be different.
