    <pre>In our universe, Maxwell&#39;s equations include Gauss&#39;s law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (div B = 0), implying there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to div B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Additionally, the curl of the magnetic field equation (Faraday&#39;s law of induction) might also be affected if magnetic monopoles exist, as it would include a term related to the rate of change of magnetic charge density. Therefore, the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be different.
