Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='The question asks which Maxwell equations change if isolated magnetic monopoles exist. Normally, Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) would acquire a source term (∇·B=ρ_m). Also Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t) would pick up a magnetic current term (−J_m). Those correspond to the divergence of B equation and the circulation of the electric field equation. That is choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
