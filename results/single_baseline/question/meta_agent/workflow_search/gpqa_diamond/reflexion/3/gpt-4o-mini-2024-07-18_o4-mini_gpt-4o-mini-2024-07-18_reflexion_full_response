Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='Maxwell’s equations without monopoles are:\n1) div·E = ρ/ε₀\n2) div·B = 0\n3) curl·E = -∂B/∂t\n4) curl·B = μ₀ j + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nIntroducing magnetic monopoles (magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density j_m) modifies Gauss’s law for magnetism (div·B ≠ 0 but = μ₀ρ_m) and Faraday’s law (curl·E gets an extra -j_m term). The other two equations remain structurally the same. Hence the changed equations are the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
