        "response": "The compound has 8 carbons: 6 in the aromatic ring, 1 in the carbonyl, and 1 in a methyl group, indicating an aryl ketone (acetophenone derivative). The IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so it's p-chloroacetophenone. This gives two aromatic doublets (2H each) around 7.6\u20137.8 ppm and a methyl singlet near 2.3 ppm. That matches choice4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
