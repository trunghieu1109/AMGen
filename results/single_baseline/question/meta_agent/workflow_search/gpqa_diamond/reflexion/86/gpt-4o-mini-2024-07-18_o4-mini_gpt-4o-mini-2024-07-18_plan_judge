Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The compound has 8 carbons: 6 in the aromatic ring, 1 in the carbonyl, and 1 in a methyl group, indicating an aryl ketone (acetophenone derivative). The IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so it's p-chloroacetophenone. This gives two aromatic doublets (2H each) around 7.6â€“7.8 ppm and a methyl singlet near 2.3 ppm. That matches choice4.
