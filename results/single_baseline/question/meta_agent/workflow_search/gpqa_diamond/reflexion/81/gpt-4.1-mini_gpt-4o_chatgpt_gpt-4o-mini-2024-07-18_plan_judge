Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The sequence of reactions involves a Diels-Alder reaction between cyclooctatetraene and maleic anhydride, forming a bicyclic anhydride. This is converted to a diester with methanol and sulfuric acid. The final Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene will favor the endo product due to secondary orbital interactions. The endo product is typically the major isomer in Diels-Alder reactions.
