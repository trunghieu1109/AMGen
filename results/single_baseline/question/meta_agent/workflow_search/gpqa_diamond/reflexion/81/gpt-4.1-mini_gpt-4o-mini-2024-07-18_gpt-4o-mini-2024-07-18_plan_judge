proposed answer: To determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3, we analyze the reactions step by step. Cyclooctatetraene reacts with maleic anhydride to form a Diels-Alder adduct, which is then treated with methanol and sulfuric acid, likely leading to a methanolysis reaction. The final product is formed by a Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene. The stereochemistry of the final product will depend on the stereochemistry of the intermediates. Given the choices, we need to identify which one corresponds to the major isomer based on the stereochemical configurations provided. The major isomer is likely to be the one with the most stable stereochemistry, which often corresponds to the one with fewer steric clashes and more favorable interactions.
