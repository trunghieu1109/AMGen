Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wZed', content='The sequence involves two consecutive Diels–Alder additions (first of maleic anhydride to cyclooctatetraene, then of cyclopentadiene to the resulting diester). In each Diels–Alder the endo product is strongly favored, placing both newly formed substituents on the same face. Among the four stereoisomeric dimethyl bicyclo[4.4.0]decadiene-10,11-dicarboxylates listed, only choice 1 has both ester substituents (C-10 and C-11) with the same configuration (10R,11R) and the correct endo relationships. Thus the major isomer is choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
