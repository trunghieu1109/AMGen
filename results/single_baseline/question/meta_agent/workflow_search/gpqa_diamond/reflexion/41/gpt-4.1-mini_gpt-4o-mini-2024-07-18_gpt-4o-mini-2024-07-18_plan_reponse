            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "response": "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can apply Kepler's Third Law, which states that T^2 is proportional to a^3, where T is the orbital period and a is the semi-major axis. The equilibrium temperature ratios can be used to find the semi-major axis ratios. The ratios of the equilibrium temperatures are given as Te1/Te2 = 1.4 and Te2/Te3 = 2.3. We can express Te3 in terms of Te1: Te3 = Te2 * 2.3 = (Te1 / 1.4) * 2.3. This gives us Te3 in terms of Te1. The semi-major axis a is related to the equilibrium temperature by the formula a = (Te^4 / (1 - A))^(1/2), where A is the albedo. Since the albedo is the same for all planets, we can find the ratios of the semi-major axes based on the ratios of the temperatures. After calculating the semi-major axis ratios, we can use them to find the period ratio using Kepler's law. The calculations lead to the conclusion that the factor is approximately 10.4.\n\nAnswer:C) ~ 10.4",
