            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "response": "To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature T of a planet is related to its distance from the star (and hence its orbital period P) by the formula T \u221d (1 - A)^(1/4) * L^(1/4) / a^(1/2), where A is the albedo, L is the luminosity of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, a is related to the orbital period by Kepler's third law: P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, T \u221d P^(-1/3). Given the temperature ratios T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3, we can find the period ratios. T1/T3 = (T1/T2) * (T2/T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22. Since T \u221d P^(-1/3), P1/P3 = (T3/T1)^3 = (1/3.22)^3. Calculating this gives P1/P3 \u2248 0.095, so P3/P1 \u2248 1/0.095 \u2248 10.5. The closest choice is ~ 10.4.\n\nAnswer:C)",
