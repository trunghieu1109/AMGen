Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have three planets with equilibrium temperatures T1, T2, T3 and the ratios T1/T2 ≈1.4, T2/T3 ≈2.3. Thus T1/T3 = (T1/T2)*(T2/T3) = 1.4*2.3 ≈3.22.
For identical albedo and the same host star, Teq ∝ a^(–1/2) so a ∝ Teq^(–2). Thus a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2 ≈(3.22)^2 ≈10.37.
By Kepler’s third law, P ∝ a^(3/2) (planet masses negligible compared to the star), so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) ≈(10.37)^(1.5) ≈33.4.
This matches choice ~33.4.
