    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method.

They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35.

    <pre>We have three planets with equilibrium temperatures T1, T2, T3 and the ratios T1/T2 ≈1.4, T2/T3 ≈2.3. Thus T1/T3 = (T1/T2)*(T2/T3) = 1.4*2.3 ≈3.22.
For identical albedo and the same host star, Teq ∝ a^(–1/2) so a ∝ Teq^(–2). Thus a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2 ≈(3.22)^2 ≈10.37.
By Kepler’s third law, P ∝ a^(3/2) (planet masses negligible compared to the star), so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) ≈(10.37)^(1.5) ≈33.4.
This matches choice ~33.4.
