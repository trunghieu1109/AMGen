Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor is determined only by the total charge enclosed. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, ensuring that the total charge remains zero. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor (at distance L) will be as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. The distance from the point P to the center of the conductor is L, and the electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated. Since L > R, we can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge at distance L. Thus, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²).
