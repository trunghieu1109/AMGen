Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, we analyze the structure based on the reactions described. The ozonolysis and subsequent reactions suggest a complex structure with multiple neighboring hydrogen atoms. The coupling pattern is influenced by the number of adjacent hydrogens. A 'doublet of triplets' indicates coupling to two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, which is plausible given the complexity of the molecule. Therefore, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a 'doublet of triplets'.
