            "1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?",

        "response": "The problem involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction with KOH likely forms a ketone, as indicated by the IR absorption at 1720 cm-1. The NMR data for product 1 suggests a structure with a deshielded hydrogen at 4.79 ppm, likely adjacent to the carbonyl group. The reaction with aluminum isopropoxide likely reduces the ketone to an alcohol. Ozonolysis followed by dimethyl sulfide treatment typically cleaves alkenes, but in this context, it may further oxidize the alcohol to a carbonyl compound (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to the carbonyl group. Considering the adamantane structure, this hydrogen would likely be a triplet due to coupling with two equivalent hydrogens.\n\nAnswer:D)",
