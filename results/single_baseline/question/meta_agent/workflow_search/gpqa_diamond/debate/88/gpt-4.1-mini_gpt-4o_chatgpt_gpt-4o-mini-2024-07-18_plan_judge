Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction with KOH likely forms a ketone, as indicated by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. The NMR data suggests a structure with a carbonyl group. The second reaction with aluminum isopropoxide could reduce the ketone to an alcohol. The final step, ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide, typically cleaves alkenes to form aldehydes or ketones. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, which would result in a specific coupling pattern. Considering the typical splitting patterns for hydrogens adjacent to carbonyls and the given choices, a triplet of triplets is a plausible coupling pattern for an aldehyde hydrogen adjacent to both a carbonyl and a methylene group in a complex environment. Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3 is likely to show a triplet of triplets pattern.
