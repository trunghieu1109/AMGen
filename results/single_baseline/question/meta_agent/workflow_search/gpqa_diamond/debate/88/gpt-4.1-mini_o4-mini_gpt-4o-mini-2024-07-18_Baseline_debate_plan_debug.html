### thinking by Debate Agent Koio:
Product 3 is an aldehyde whose most deshielded proton is the aldehydic H.  It is vicinal to two equivalent methylene protons, giving a triplet.

### thinking by Debate Agent EsTq:
We have 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with base to give an α,β-unsaturated ketone (IR 1720; 1H NMR 4.79 ppm, 2H exo-methylene), which upon Al(OiPr)3 isomerizes to an internal alkene. Ozonolysis of that alkene yields a bicyclic diketone 3. The most deshielded proton in 3 is the methine α to a C=O; it is flanked by two nonequivalent sets of two vicinal methylene protons (one set axial, one equatorial) giving two distinct 3J couplings. Thus it is split into a triplet by one pair and into a triplet by the other, i.e. a triplet of triplets.

### thinking by Debate Agent e3P8:
First, product 1 shows an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl, and the ¹H NMR peak at δ 4.79 (2H) implies CH₂ α to C=O. Product 1 is thus a cage ketone. Heating with Al(OiPr)₃ gives the corresponding alkene (product 2) via Oppenauer–Meerwein rearrangement. Ozonolysis of that alkene (product 2) followed by reductive workup (DMS) yields a dialdehyde (product 3) in which the most deshielded proton is the bridgehead CH adjacent to two nonequivalent CH₂ groups. Each set of two H couples with a different J, so its signal is split into a triplet by one CH₂ (J₁), and each line of that triplet is further split into a triplet by the other CH₂ (J₂), giving a triplet of triplets.

### thinking by Debate Agent l1bH:
Product 3 carries a CH adjacent to a newly formed carbonyl (most deshielded non‐exchangeable proton).  That CH is vicinal to four equivalent Hs (two on each of two equivalent CH2 groups).  Coupling to four equivalent protons of similar J produces a pentet.

    <pre>Product 3 arises from reductive ozonolysis of the internal alkene, giving an aldehyde whose most deshielded proton is the formyl H. That proton couples only to the two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH2 (α‐protons to the carbonyl), giving a triplet (n + 1 = 2 + 1).
