Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Product 3 arises from reductive ozonolysis of the internal alkene, giving an aldehyde whose most deshielded proton is the formyl H. That proton couples only to the two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH2 (α‐protons to the carbonyl), giving a triplet (n + 1 = 2 + 1).

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 2
