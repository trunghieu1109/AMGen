Question: Example(question='Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.\n1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A\n(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C', choice1='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice2='A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', choice3='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal', choice4='A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Reaction 1 under acid/heat undergoes a Prins‐type cyclization of the aminodimethylacetal with the allylic alcohol to give a 6‐membered dihydropyran amine (6‐methyl‐3,4‐dihydro‐2H‐pyran‐2‐amine). Reaction 2 heating a 1,5‐hexadiyne triggers an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of the alkynes, forming cyclobutane with two exocyclic ethylidene groups in the (1Z,2E) configuration. Reaction 3 is a Claisen rearrangement of the allyl vinyl ether to an enal which tautomerizes to 4‐methylenehexanal. Only choice 3 matches all three products.
