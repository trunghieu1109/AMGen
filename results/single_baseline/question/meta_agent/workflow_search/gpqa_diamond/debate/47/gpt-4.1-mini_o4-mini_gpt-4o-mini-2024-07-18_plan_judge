Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The key is that LiAlH(OtBu)₃ was used to reduce the α‐chlorocyclohexanone (product 3) selectively to the corresponding alcohol without touching the alkyl chloride. Thus product 4 is trans‐2-chlorocyclohexanol, a 6-membered ring bearing an OH at C1 and a Cl at C2 (two stereocenters) with no remaining symmetry. The ring has two CH centers (one H each) and four CH₂ centers (2 H each), giving a total of 2 × 1 + 4 × 2 = 10 hydrogens, all in distinct environments.
