Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction sequence involves several transformations starting from cyclohexanone. The first step is bromination, likely forming an alpha-bromo cyclohexanone. The second step with sodium hydroxide could lead to a haloform reaction, resulting in a carboxylate, which upon acidification forms cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. The third step with thionyl chloride and pyridine converts the acid to an acyl chloride. The final reduction step with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride forms an aldehyde, specifically cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. In cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, there are 5 hydrogen atoms on the cyclohexane ring and 1 aldehydic hydrogen, making a total of 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.
