        "response": "The key is that LiAlH(OtBu)\u2083 was used to reduce the \u03b1\u2010chlorocyclohexanone (product 3) selectively to the corresponding alcohol without touching the alkyl chloride. Thus product 4 is trans\u20102-chlorocyclohexanol, a 6-membered ring bearing an OH at C1 and a Cl at C2 (two stereocenters) with no remaining symmetry. The ring has two CH centers (one H each) and four CH\u2082 centers (2 H each), giving a total of 2 \u00d7 1 + 4 \u00d7 2 = 10 hydrogens, all in distinct environments.\n\nAnswer:D",
