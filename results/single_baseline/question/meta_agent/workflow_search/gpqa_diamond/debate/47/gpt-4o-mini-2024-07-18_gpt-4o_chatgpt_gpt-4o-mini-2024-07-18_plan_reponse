        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The reaction sequence involves several transformations starting from cyclohexanone. The first step is bromination, likely forming an alpha-bromo cyclohexanone. The second step with sodium hydroxide could lead to a haloform reaction, resulting in a carboxylate, which upon acidification forms cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. The third step with thionyl chloride and pyridine converts the acid to an acyl chloride. The final reduction step with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride forms an aldehyde, specifically cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. In cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, there are 5 hydrogen atoms on the cyclohexane ring and 1 aldehydic hydrogen, making a total of 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nAnswer:B)",
