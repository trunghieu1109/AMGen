If two compounds have very similar polarity, they travel the same distance up the plate and their spots overlap (“on top of each other”). Other choices (non-covalent interactions, optical rotations, boiling points) are not relevant to TLC spot separation.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MVNU:\nIn organic synthesis labs, chemists routinely use thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to monitor reaction progress and purity of compounds. On a TLC plate, compounds separate based on polarity—more polar compounds stick more to the silica and travel less, less polar travel farther. If two compounds have very similar polarities, their Rf values will be nearly identical, causing their spots to overlap (appear on top of each other). Thus, the chemist’s complaint refers to overlapping spots on a TLC plate, meaning the compounds have similar polarities.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent m7kK:\nThe phrase “compounds are on top of each other” refers to their spots co‐eluting in thin layer chromatography, indicating they have nearly identical Rf values, which arise from similar polarities.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent sNsA:\nThe phrase “compounds are on top of each other” refers to spots on a chromatogram (e.g., TLC) overlapping because they travel the same distance. That occurs when compounds have similar polarities, giving similar Rf values. The other options (van der Waals bonding, optical rotations, boiling points) don’t explain overlapping spots in chromatography.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent rF5v:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MVNU:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent m7kK:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent sNsA:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
