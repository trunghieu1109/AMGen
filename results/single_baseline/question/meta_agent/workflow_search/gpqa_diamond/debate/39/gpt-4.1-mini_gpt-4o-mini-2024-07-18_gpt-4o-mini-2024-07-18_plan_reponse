            "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?",
            "The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.",

        "response": "The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' indicates that the compounds are likely interacting in a way that causes them to aggregate or stack, which is most commonly associated with non-covalent interactions such as van der Waals forces. This interpretation aligns with the idea of compounds being physically 'on top of each other', suggesting they are bonding through non-covalent interactions. The other options do not imply such physical stacking or aggregation, making option A the most appropriate choice.\n\nAnswer:A",
