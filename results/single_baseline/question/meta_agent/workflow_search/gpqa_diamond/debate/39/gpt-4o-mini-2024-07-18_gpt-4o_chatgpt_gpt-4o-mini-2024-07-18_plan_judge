Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests an issue with separation or purification, likely in a chromatography context. This is often due to compounds having similar properties that cause them to elute closely together. The most relevant property in this context is polarity, as compounds with similar polarities will interact similarly with the stationary phase, leading to poor separation. While non-covalent interactions could cause physical stacking, the context of the statement suggests a separation issue rather than physical aggregation. Therefore, the most likely interpretation is that the compounds have similar polarities, causing them to be 'on top of each other' in the chromatography column.
