            "Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.",

        "response": "Compound A\u2019s NMR (6H triplet at 0.9 ppm, 4H quartet at 1.3 ppm) matches n-butane. Radical bromination gives 2-bromobutane (B), elimination yields cis/trans-2-butene (C). The cis isomer undergoes an endo Diels\u2013Alder with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to give the cyclohex-2-enol with three methyls all on the same face and the OH at C-1, corresponding to (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol (choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
