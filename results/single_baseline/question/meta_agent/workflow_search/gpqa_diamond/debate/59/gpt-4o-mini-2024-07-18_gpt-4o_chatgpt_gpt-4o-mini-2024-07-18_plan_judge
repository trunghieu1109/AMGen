Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the time dilation effect for an astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is 22 years, and the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Using the time dilation formula t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), we calculate the dilated time experienced by an observer on Earth. The Lorentz factor (gamma) is approximately 1/sqrt(0.00000026), which is a large number, indicating significant time dilation. Multiplying the proper time (22 years) by this factor gives the dilated time, which matches the choice of 72 years.
