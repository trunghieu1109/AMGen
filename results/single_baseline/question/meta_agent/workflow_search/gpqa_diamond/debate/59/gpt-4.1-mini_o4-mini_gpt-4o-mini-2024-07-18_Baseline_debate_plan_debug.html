    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;72 years&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;77 years&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;81 years&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent KrZn:
The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light years away. At v=0.99999987c, β=0.99999987 so 1–β^2≈2.6×10^−7 and γ=1/√(1–β^2)≈1/√(2.6×10^−7)≈1960. The travel time in the lab frame is D/v≈160,000 years. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is τ=D/(γc)≈160,000/1960≈81.6 years, rounding to about 81 years, which is within their lifetime.

### thinking by Debate Agent xFvZ:
The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 1.63×10^5 light-years away. At v=0.99999987c the Lorentz factor γ≈1/√(1–v^2/c^2)≈1/√(2.6×10^–7)≈2000. The Earth‐frame travel time is t≈d/v≈1.63×10^5 yr, so the astronaut’s proper time is τ=t/γ≈1.63×10^5 yr/2000≈81.5 yr. Thus from the astronaut’s point of view it takes about 81 years and he survives (22+81&lt;150).

### thinking by Debate Agent qfjM:
We need the proper time experienced by the astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth at v=0.99999987c. The LMC is about 160,000–163,000 light years away. At this speed, the Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1–v²/c²) ≈ 1/√(1–0.99999987²) ≈ 1/√(2.6×10⁻⁷) ≈ 1960. In the astronaut’s frame, the distance is length-contracted: L&#39; = L/γ ≈ 163,000 ly / 1960 ≈ 83 ly. The proper travel time is then τ = L&#39;/c ≈ 83 years. Matching the choices gives approximately 81 years.

### thinking by Debate Agent Id9D:
The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. At v=0.99999987c, β≈0.99999987 so 1–β^2≈2.6×10^–7, giving a Lorentz factor γ≈1/√(2.6×10^–7)≈1960. The proper travel time t′=L/(γv)≈160,000 yr/(1960)≈81.6 yr. Thus the astronaut’s onboard time is about 81 years.
