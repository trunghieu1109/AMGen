    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;72 years&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;77 years&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;81 years&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent KrZn:
To solve this, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to traveling at relativistic speeds. The formula for time dilation is t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. The astronaut experiences 22 years, so t&#39; = 22 years. The velocity v = 0.99999987*c. We need to calculate the time as experienced by someone at rest relative to Earth (t&#39;).

### thinking by Debate Agent xFvZ:
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation from Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is different from the time experienced by an observer on Earth (dilated time). The formula for time dilation is t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t0 is the proper time, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. We are given that the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987*c and the astronaut&#39;s proper time is 22 years. We need to find the dilated time t, which is the time experienced on Earth. First, calculate the Lorentz factor: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.99999974) = 1/sqrt(0.00000026). Then, t = 22 * gamma. Calculate the value and compare it to the given choices.

To solve this, we need to consider time dilation, a concept from Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) will be different from the time experienced by observers on Earth. The time dilation formula is: t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the time experienced by the astronaut, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. Given that the astronaut&#39;s time (t) is 22 years and the speed is 0.99999987c, we calculate the time experienced on Earth (t&#39;).

### thinking by Debate Agent Id9D:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of time dilation from the theory of relativity, as the spacecraft is traveling at a speed close to the speed of light. The formula for time dilation is given by: t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t&#39; is the time experienced by the astronaut, t is the time experienced by an observer at rest relative to Earth, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. We are given that the astronaut experiences 22 years. We need to find the time it takes to reach Earth from the perspective of the astronaut. Thus, we rearrange the formula to solve for t: t = t&#39; * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Given v = 0.99999987c, and t&#39; = 22 years, we can calculate t.

    <pre>The problem involves calculating the time dilation effect for an astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is 22 years, and the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Using the time dilation formula t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), we calculate the dilated time experienced by an observer on Earth. The Lorentz factor (gamma) is approximately 1/sqrt(0.00000026), which is a large number, indicating significant time dilation. Multiplying the proper time (22 years) by this factor gives the dilated time, which matches the choice of 72 years.
