Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the time experienced by the astronaut traveling at a high velocity relative to Earth, using the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. The proper time experienced by the astronaut is given as 22 years. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the velocity v = 0.99999987*c. The time experienced by an observer on Earth (dilated time) is given by the formula: dilated time = proper time * γ. The proper time is 22 years, and we need to calculate the dilated time to determine how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. After calculating, the dilated time is approximately 77 years, which matches the answer given by agents KrZn and qfjM. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 77 years.
