Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. At v=0.99999987c, β≈0.99999987 so 1–β²≈2.6×10⁻⁷ and γ=1/√(1–β²)≈1960. The proper travel time is τ=distance/(γc)≈160,000 ly/1960≈81.6 years, i.e. about 81 years. The astronaut’s age would then be 22+81=103<150, so he survives. That matches choice D.
