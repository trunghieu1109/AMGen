            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).",
            "A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "Tautomerism involves keto\u2013enol shifts at alpha\u2010hydrogens. Benzoquinone lacks alpha\u2010hydrogens and would lose aromaticity if it tried to enolize, so it does not show tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can enolize. Optical isomerism requires a stereogenic center: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has one and is chiral, while dimethyl fumarate is a symmetric trans-alkene with no chiral center. Therefore A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice3, i.e. C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
