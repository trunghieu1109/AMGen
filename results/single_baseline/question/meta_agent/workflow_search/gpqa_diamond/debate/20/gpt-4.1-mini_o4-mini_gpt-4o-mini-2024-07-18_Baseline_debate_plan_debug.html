### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
First, tautomerism requires keto–enol interconversion. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto–enol tautomerism at its carbonyl sites, whereas benzoquinone would lose aromaticity to form an enol and thus does not tautomerize under normal conditions. So A = benzoquinone. Second, optical isomerism arises from chirality. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the α-carbon (–CH(OH)–), so it shows optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate is a symmetric trans-alkene ester with no chiral center. So B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That corresponds to choice 3, i.e. C.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
First, identify which compound does not show tautomerism (A). Benzoquinone (C6H4O2) cannot tautomerize to a keto–enol pair because its putative “enol” form (hydroquinone, C6H6O2) has a different molecular formula (it contains two extra hydrogens), so benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C6H6O3) can enolize (beta-diketone-type tautomerism), so it does show tautomerism. Therefore A = benzoquinone.

Next, determine which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism (B). Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the CH–OH carbon and hence is chiral and optically active. Dimethyl fumarate is a trans-alkene with two identical substituents on each double-bond carbon (H and COOCH3), so it is E (trans) but achiral and does not show optical isomerism. Therefore B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Matching these to the given choices:
choice1: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate  (wrong B)
choice2: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  (wrong A)
choice3: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  (correct)
choice4: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate  (wrong both)

Thus the correct option is choice3, which corresponds to answer C).

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
We need to identify (A) which of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show keto–enol tautomerism, and (B) which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. 1) Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) undergoes a redox equilibrium to hydroquinone, not a keto–enol tautomerism; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (a cyclic triketone) has active methylene groups and readily enolizes. Thus, A = benzoquinone. 2) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic carbon (four different substituents) and is optically active; dimethyl fumarate is a symmetric alkene with no stereocenter. Thus, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This corresponds to choice3, which is option C).

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
1. Tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens to shift; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and tautomerizes to phloroglucinol, whereas benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and does not tautomerize. 2. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center; methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (lactic acid ester) has one, dimethyl fumarate does not. Therefore A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, corresponding to choice3.

    <pre>Tautomerism involves keto–enol shifts at alpha‐hydrogens. Benzoquinone lacks alpha‐hydrogens and would lose aromaticity if it tried to enolize, so it does not show tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can enolize. Optical isomerism requires a stereogenic center: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has one and is chiral, while dimethyl fumarate is a symmetric trans-alkene with no chiral center.
