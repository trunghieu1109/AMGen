Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we analyze benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone can exist in tautomeric forms, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism due to its stable structure. For the second part regarding optical isomerism, we check methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and can exist in two different configurations (cis and trans), indicating it can show optical isomerism, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can also show optical isomerism. However, the question specifically asks which one shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate is the more prominent example due to its geometric isomerism. Therefore, the correct answers are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and B = dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Answer:A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
Extracted answer: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
Correct answer: 3
