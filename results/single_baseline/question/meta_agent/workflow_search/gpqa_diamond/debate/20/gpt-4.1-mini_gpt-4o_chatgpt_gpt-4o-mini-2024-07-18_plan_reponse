            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).",

        "response": "The question asks which compound does not show tautomerism and which one shows optical isomerism. Benzoquinone does not have the necessary hydrogen atoms for tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to its keto groups. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, the correct choice is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:C)",
