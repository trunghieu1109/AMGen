    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone &amp; cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone can exist in tautomeric forms, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism due to its stable structure. For the second part, optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and can exist in two different configurations (cis and trans), while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have such chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is known to exhibit tautomerism due to the presence of a conjugated system, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit this property. For optical isomerism, we need to check the compounds methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, allowing for optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center because it has a plane of symmetry. Thus, the correct answers are that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism (A) and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism (B).

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is known to exhibit tautomerism due to its conjugated system, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism due to its saturated structure. For the second part, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and can show optical isomerism due to the presence of two different groups on either side of the double bond, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have this feature. Therefore, the correct answers are: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and B = dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
To determine which compound does not show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, we need to analyze their structures. Benzoquinone is known to exist in tautomeric forms, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism due to its stable structure. For the second part, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chirality, which is present in dimethyl fumarate due to its double bond and different substituents, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have the same level of chirality. Therefore, the correct choices are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (does not show tautomerism) and B = dimethyl fumarate (shows optical isomerism).

### answer by Debate Agent 5cfs:
A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

### answer by Debate Agent jowT:
A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

### answer by Debate Agent zqEy:
A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

### answer by Debate Agent t3I8:
A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

    <pre>To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we analyze benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone can exist in tautomeric forms, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism due to its stable structure. For the second part regarding optical isomerism, we check methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and can exist in two different configurations (cis and trans), indicating it can show optical isomerism, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can also show optical isomerism. However, the question specifically asks which one shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate is the more prominent example due to its geometric isomerism. Therefore, the correct answers are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and B = dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Answer:A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate</pre>
