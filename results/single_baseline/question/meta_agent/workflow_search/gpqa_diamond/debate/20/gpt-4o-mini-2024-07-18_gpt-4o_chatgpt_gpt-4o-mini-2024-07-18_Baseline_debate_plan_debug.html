### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
Tautomerism involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom within the molecule, typically between a carbon and an oxygen or nitrogen atom. Benzoquinone, being a stable diketone, does not exhibit tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to the presence of multiple carbonyl groups. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group, thus it can show optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate does not have such a chiral center.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
First, evaluate which compound does not exhibit tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Tautomerism usually involves compounds with keto-enol types of structures. Benzoquinone is a stable quinone that does not exhibit tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exist in keto-enol forms. Thus, A is benzoquinone. Next, determine which compound exhibits optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, hence it will show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being a symmetric molecule, does not exhibit optical isomerism. Thus, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to consider the structural properties of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone does not have an enolizable hydrogen, thus it does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, however, can exist in keto and enol forms, showing tautomerism. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate does not, as it is a symmetrical molecule. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
To solve this, we need to analyze the tautomerism and optical isomerism properties of the given compounds. Tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen atoms and electrons, typically seen in compounds with carbonyl groups and alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone does not have an alpha hydrogen, so it does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism due to its structure. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, thus can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.

    <pre>All agents agree that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it lacks an enolizable hydrogen, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, allowing it to show optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, the correct choice is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
