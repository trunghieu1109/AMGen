Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it lacks an enolizable hydrogen, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, allowing it to show optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, the correct choice is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
