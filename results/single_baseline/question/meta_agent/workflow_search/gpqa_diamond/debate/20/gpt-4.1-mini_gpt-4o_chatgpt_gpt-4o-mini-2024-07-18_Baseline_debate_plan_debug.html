### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
Benzoquinone does not have alpha hydrogen atoms that are necessary for tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize due to the presence of keto groups. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
Tautomerism is a form of structural isomerism where compounds can readily interconvert between two forms, typically involving the relocation of a proton. Benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism as it lacks the necessary hydrogen atom for tautomerism to occur, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can potentially undergo tautomerism due to the presence of carbonyl groups and hydrogen atoms. Optical isomerism occurs in compounds that have chiral centers. Dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does, as it can exist in enantiomeric forms due to the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
Tautomerism involves the shifting of protons and the formation of double bonds, typically seen in compounds with keto-enol forms. Benzoquinone does not have hydrogen atoms adjacent to carbonyl groups to allow for tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxy group, whereas dimethyl fumarate, being a symmetrical alkene, does not have a chiral center.

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to consider the structural characteristics of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone has a stable quinone structure and does not readily undergo tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, can potentially undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to the presence of carbonyl groups. Therefore, benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism (A). For optical isomerism, we need to identify a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon, allowing for optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (B).

    <pre>The question asks which compound does not show tautomerism and which one shows optical isomerism. Benzoquinone does not have the necessary hydrogen atoms for tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to its keto groups. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, the correct choice is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
