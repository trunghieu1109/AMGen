Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia involves the formation of a benzyne intermediate. The deuterium atom is at the ortho position relative to the bromine. In a typical benzyne mechanism, the strong base NaNH2 abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate. The benzyne can then be attacked by the NH2- nucleophile at either of the two adjacent positions, resulting in two different aniline derivatives. The presence of deuterium does not change the number of possible products, only their isotopic labeling. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is two, corresponding to the two possible positions for nucleophilic attack on the benzyne intermediate.
