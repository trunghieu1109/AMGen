Base can abstract either the D at C2 or the H at C6, giving two different benzyne eliminations. Each benzyne undergoes nucleophilic attack at either of the two carbons of the triple bond, yielding two products per benzyne. Total products = 2 eliminations × 2 attack sites = 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zb07:\n1-bromobenzene-2-D undergoes benzyne formation via elimination of Br and either the D at C2 or the H at C6, giving two distinct benzyne intermediates. Each benzyne can be attacked by NH2– at either carbon of the triple bond, yielding two products per intermediate. This gives 2 × 2 = 4 distinct organic products (including labeled vs. unlabeled).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YjAU:\nThe reaction proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. Starting from 1-bromobenzene-2-D, base can remove either the H at C6 (fast) or the D at C2 (slow) to give two benzynes. (1) Elimination of H at C6 retains D at C2; nucleophilic attack at either benzyne carbon yields two distinct deuterated aniline isomers. (2) Elimination of D at C2 yields an undeuterated benzyne, and attack at either carbon gives the same aniline (no D). Thus there are 2 deuterated products + 1 undeuterated product = 3 distinct organic products.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 115N:\nThe base can remove either the H or D at the two positions ortho to the bromine to give two distinct benzynes. Each benzyne then undergoes nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond, giving two products per benzyne (four isotopically distinct products in all).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent EBL4:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zb07:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YjAU:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 115N:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
