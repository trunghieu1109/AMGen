        "response": "1-bromobenzene-2-D can lose either the D at C2 or the H at C6 to give two distinct benzyne intermediates. Each benzyne undergoes nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond, yielding two positional isomers per intermediate. Thus 2 benzynes \u00d7 2 attack sites = 4 distinct organic products.\n\nAnswer:A)",
