Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, which is a classic setup for generating a benzyne intermediate. The benzyne intermediate can form by the elimination of HBr, and the nucleophile (NH2-) can attack the benzyne at two different positions, leading to two possible substitution products. The presence of deuterium does not significantly alter the reaction pathway or the number of products. Therefore, the consensus among the agents is that there are two possible organic products formed in this reaction.
