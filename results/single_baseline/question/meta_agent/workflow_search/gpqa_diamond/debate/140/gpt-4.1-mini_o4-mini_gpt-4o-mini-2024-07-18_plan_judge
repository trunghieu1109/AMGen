Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: 1-bromobenzene-2-D can lose either the D at C2 or the H at C6 to give two distinct benzyne intermediates. Each benzyne undergoes nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond, yielding two positional isomers per intermediate. Thus 2 benzynes Ã— 2 attack sites = 4 distinct organic products.

Answer:A)
Extracted answer: A)
Correct answer: 2
