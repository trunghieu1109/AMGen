            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "response": "The problem involves calculating the amplitude of the light curve variation due to star spots and equating it to the amplitude caused by an exoplanet transit. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere and are 1000K cooler than the rest of the star. The brightness of a blackbody is proportional to T^4, so the brightness of the spotted region compared to the unspotted region can be calculated as (5000/6000)^4. The amplitude of the light curve due to spots is proportional to the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted regions. For an exoplanet transit, the amplitude is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. By equating these two amplitudes, we can solve for Rpl/Rstar. Most agents agree on choice C) ~0.11, which seems reasonable given the calculations involved.\n\nAnswer:C)",
