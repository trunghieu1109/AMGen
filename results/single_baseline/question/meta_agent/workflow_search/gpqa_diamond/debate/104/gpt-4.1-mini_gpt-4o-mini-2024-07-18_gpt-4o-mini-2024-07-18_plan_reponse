            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "response": "To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star, we analyze the effect of dark spots on the star's brightness. The star has an effective temperature of 6000K, while the dark spots are at 5000K due to a temperature difference of 1000K. The filling factor of the spots is 20%, meaning 20% of the star's surface is cooler and contributes less light. The brightness variation caused by the spots can be modeled similarly to the transit of an exoplanet, where the planet blocks a portion of the star's light. The amplitude of brightness variation is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)^2. By equating the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a transiting exoplanet, we find that the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star is approximately 0.11. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C",
