            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "response": "The problem involves calculating the brightness change due to star spots and equating it to the brightness change due to a transiting exoplanet. The star has a filling factor of 20% for spots, which are 1000K cooler than the star's effective temperature of 6000K. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the brightness change due to spots is calculated as: \u0394F/F = (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4. This results in a relative brightness change of approximately 0.1035. For a transiting exoplanet, the relative brightness change is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Equating these gives (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) \u2248 0.3218. This matches closest to choice 2, which is ~0.32.\n\nAnswer:B)",
