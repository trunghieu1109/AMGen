            "ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?",

Adding DSG strengthens protein\u2013protein crosslinks and removes these artifacts, so peaks that disappear with PFA+DSG are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.\n\nAnswer:A)",
