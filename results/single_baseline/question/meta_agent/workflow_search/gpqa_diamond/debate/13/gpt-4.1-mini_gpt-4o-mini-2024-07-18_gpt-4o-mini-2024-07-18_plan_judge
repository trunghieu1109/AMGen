Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The disappearance of ChIP peaks when using PFA+DSG fixation indicates that the binding of the IKAROS transcription factor is sensitive to the fixation method. Active promoters and enhancers are regions where transcription factors like IKAROS typically bind dynamically, and their interactions can be disrupted by more aggressive fixation methods. Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that the disappearing peaks are likely found at active promoters and enhancers, as these regions are sensitive to the fixation conditions used in ChIP-seq experiments.
