Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Formaldehyde-only fixation often yields nonspecific “hyper-ChIPable” peaks in open, hyperaccessible chromatin (e.g. active promoters and enhancers). Adding DSG strengthens protein–protein crosslinks and removes these artifacts, so peaks that disappear with PFA+DSG are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.
