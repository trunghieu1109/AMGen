Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question involves understanding the impact of different fixation methods on ChIP-seq results. PFA fixation can sometimes cause non-specific interactions, while DSG can stabilize protein-protein interactions. The disappearing peaks with PFA+DSG suggest that these peaks might be due to non-specific interactions rather than specific binding sites of the IKAROS transcription factor. Such non-specific interactions are often found at repetitive regions or random locations in the genome, as opposed to specific regulatory regions like promoters and enhancers. Introns of large genes may also have indirect interactions or protein complexes that could be disrupted by DSG. Therefore, the disappearing peaks are most likely due to non-specific interactions at repeats.
