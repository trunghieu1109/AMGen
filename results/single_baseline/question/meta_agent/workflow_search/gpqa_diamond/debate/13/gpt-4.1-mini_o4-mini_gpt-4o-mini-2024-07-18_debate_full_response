Adding DSG (protein–protein crosslinker) rigidifies chromatin, reducing these biases; as a result, peaks driven by sonication bias at open chromatin disappear with PFA+DSG. Thus the PFA-only–specific peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TOTF:\nFormaldehyde cross‐links proteins to DNA (and short‐range protein–protein), capturing both specific and nonspecific interactions especially in open, hyperaccessible chromatin (e.g. active promoters/enhancers). DSG is a longer arm protein–protein crosslinker that stabilizes bona fide protein complexes but reduces nonspecific background. Peaks seen with PFA alone that vanish when DSG is added are likely artifacts from hyperaccessible regions where nonspecific binding occurs. Therefore disappearing peaks localize to active promoters and enhancers.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1hOh:\nChIP-seq peaks that disappear with stronger crosslinking (PFA+DSG) are likely artifacts from open chromatin regions (‘Phantom peaks’) that are captured under mild fixation but lost when fixation is more stringent. Such regions correspond to active promoters and enhancers rather than repeats, introns of large genes, or random locations.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TwPR:\nFormaldehyde-only ChIP-seq often yields non-specific “hyper-ChIPable” peaks at highly accessible, active regulatory regions (promoters/enhancers). These disappear when stronger protein–protein crosslinking (DSG+PFA) improves specificity, retaining true IKAROS sites and losing artifacts. Hence disappearing peaks map to active promoters/enhancers.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent gTpr:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TOTF:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1hOh:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TwPR:\nA\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
