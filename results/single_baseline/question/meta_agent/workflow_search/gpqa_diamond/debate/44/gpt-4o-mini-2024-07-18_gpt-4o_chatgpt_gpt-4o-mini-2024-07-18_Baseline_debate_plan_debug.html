### thinking by Debate Agent GLmR:
The energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is a positive integer. For four identical spin-1/2 particles, we need to fill the lowest available energy levels considering the Pauli exclusion principle. The ground state will have two particles with n=1 and two particles with n=2. The energy for the ground state will be 2*(1^2)*E + 2*(2^2)*E = 2E + 8E = 10E. For the first excited state, one particle will move to n=3, giving 1*(1^2)*E + 2*(2^2)*E + 1*(3^2)*E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. For the second excited state, another particle will move to n=3, giving 2*(1^2)*E + 1*(2^2)*E + 1*(3^2)*E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Therefore, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E.

### thinking by Debate Agent zbiy:
The energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For four identical spin-1/2 particles, we must consider the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires that no two fermions occupy the same quantum state. In the ground state, the particles will occupy the lowest available energy levels. The quantum numbers for the ground state will be 1, 2, 3, and 4, giving energies E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3 = 9E, and E_4 = 16E. Summing these gives the ground state energy as 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. For the first excited state, one particle will be promoted to the next available energy level, so the quantum numbers will be 1, 2, 3, and 5, giving energies E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3 = 9E, and E_5 = 25E. Summing these gives the first excited state energy as 1E + 4E + 9E + 25E = 39E. For the second excited state, the quantum numbers will be 1, 2, 4, and 5, giving energies E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_4 = 16E, and E_5 = 25E. Summing these gives the second excited state energy as 1E + 4E + 16E + 25E = 46E. However, this value does not match any of the provided options, so there might be a mistake in the expected answer or the options.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2J45:
For a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is an integer quantum number. For four identical spin-1/2 fermions, they will occupy the lowest available energy states due to the Pauli exclusion principle. In the ground state, the particles will occupy n=1 and n=2 levels, with two particles in each. Thus, the ground state energy is 2*(1^2)*E + 2*(2^2)*E = 2E + 8E = 10E. For the first excited state, one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so the energy is 2E + 2E + 9E = 15E. For the second excited state, another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so the energy is 2E + 9E + 9E = 20E. However, this doesn&#39;t match any of the given options, indicating a potential oversight in calculating the second excited state. Re-evaluating, the correct sequence of energy levels for the second excited state should be considered carefully, ensuring accurate calculations.

### thinking by Debate Agent fKuF:
For four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, they must occupy distinct quantum states due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The energy levels are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For the ground state, the particles will occupy the lowest available levels: n=1, 2, 3, 4. The total energy is E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 1^2*E + 2^2*E + 3^2*E + 4^2*E = 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. For the first excited state, one particle is moved to the next higher state, so the configuration could be n=1, 2, 3, 5, giving total energy E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_5 = 1E + 4E + 9E + 25E = 39E. For the second excited state, another configuration is n=1, 2, 4, 5, giving total energy E_1 + E_2 + E_4 + E_5 = 1E + 4E + 16E + 25E = 46E. However, there seems to be a typo in the options. The correct second excited state energy should be 46E, but based on the given options, the closest match is 50E.
