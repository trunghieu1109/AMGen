        "response": "The energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For four identical spin-1/2 fermions, the particles will fill the lowest available energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion principle. In the ground state, the particles will occupy the n=1 and n=2 levels, giving energies 1^2 * E and 2^2 * E, thus total energy = 4E. For the first excited state, one particle moves to the next available level, n=3, so the energies are 1^2 * E, 2^2 * E, 2^2 * E, and 3^2 * E, giving total energy = 10E. For the second excited state, another particle moves to the next level, n=3, giving energies 1^2 * E, 2^2 * E, 3^2 * E, and 3^2 * E, thus total energy = 15E. This matches choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
