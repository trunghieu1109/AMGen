Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For fermions in a 1D infinite well each level n has energy n²E and holds two spin-½ particles. In the ground state fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles): E₀=2·1²E+2·2²E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3: E₁=2·1²E+1·2²E+1·3²E=15E. Second excited: promote one from n=1 to n=3: E₂=1·1²E+2·2²E+1·3²E=18E, which matches choice 2.
