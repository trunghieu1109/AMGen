Single-particle energies are En=n^2E. Each level can hold two fermions (opposite spins). Ground state: fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles) ⇒ Egs=2·1^2E+2·2^2E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3 ⇒ energies:2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=15E. Next: the lowest next excitation is moving one from n=1 to n=3 ⇒ occupancy (1,2,2,3) ⇒ E=1·E+2·4E+9E=18E. Thus the sequence is 10E, 15E, 18E, which corresponds to choice2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zbiy:\nFor four spin-½ fermions in a 1D infinite well, each spatial level n can hold two particles. Ground state: fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles) ⇒ E_tot=2·1^2E+2·2^2E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3 ⇒ E=2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=15E. Second excited: instead promote one from n=1 to n=3: E=1·1^2E+2·2^2E+1·3^2E=18E. Matches choice2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2J45:\nFor four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well, each level n can hold two particles. Ground state: fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles): E=2·1^2E+2·2^2E=10E. First excited: move one particle from n=2 to n=3: occupancies (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1) gives E=2·1^2E+1·2^2E+1·3^2E=15E. Second excited: the next minimal is moving one from n=1 to n=3: (n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1) gives E=1·1^2E+2·2^2E+1·3^2E=18E.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fKuF:\nFor four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well, each level n has energy n^2E and can hold two spins. Ground state: fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles): total energy = 2·1^2E + 2·2^2E = 2E + 8E = 10E. First excited: excite one particle from n=2 to n=3: energy = 2·1^2E + 1·2^2E + 1·3^2E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Second excited: excite one from n=1 to n=3: energy = 1·1^2E + 2·2^2E + 1·3^2E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
