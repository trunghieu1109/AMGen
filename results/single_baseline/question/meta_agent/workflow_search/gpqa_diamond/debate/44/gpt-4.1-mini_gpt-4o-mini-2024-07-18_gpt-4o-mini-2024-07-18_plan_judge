proposed answer: To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the Pauli exclusion principle and the quantization of energy levels. The energy levels for a single particle are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For four spin-1/2 particles, the ground state will occupy the lowest energy levels: the first two particles will occupy n=1 and n=2, and the next two will occupy n=2 and n=3. The total energy for the ground state is 4E, for the first excited state is 10E, and for the second excited state is 15E. This matches the calculations and reasoning provided by multiple agents, confirming the energies as 4E, 10E, and 15E respectively.

Answer:4E, 10E, 15E
Extracted answer: 4E, 10E, 15E
