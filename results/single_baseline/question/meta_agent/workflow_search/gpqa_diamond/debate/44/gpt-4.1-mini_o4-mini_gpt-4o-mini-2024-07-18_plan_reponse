        "response": "For fermions in a 1D infinite well each level n has energy n\u00b2E and holds two spin-\u00bd particles. In the ground state fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles): E\u2080=2\u00b71\u00b2E+2\u00b72\u00b2E=10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3: E\u2081=2\u00b71\u00b2E+1\u00b72\u00b2E+1\u00b73\u00b2E=15E. Second excited: promote one from n=1 to n=3: E\u2082=1\u00b71\u00b2E+2\u00b72\u00b2E+1\u00b73\u00b2E=18E, which matches choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
