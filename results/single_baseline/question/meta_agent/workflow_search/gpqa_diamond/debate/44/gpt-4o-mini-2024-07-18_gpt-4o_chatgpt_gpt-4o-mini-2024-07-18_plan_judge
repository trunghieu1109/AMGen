proposed answer: The energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where n is the quantum number. For four identical spin-1/2 particles, we must consider the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires that no two fermions occupy the same quantum state. In the ground state, the particles will occupy the lowest available energy levels. The quantum numbers for the ground state will be 1, 2, 3, and 4, giving energies E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3 = 9E, and E_4 = 16E. Summing these gives the ground state energy as 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. For the first excited state, one particle will be promoted to the next available energy level, so the quantum numbers will be 1, 2, 3, and 5, giving energies E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3 = 9E, and E_5 = 25E. Summing these gives the first excited state energy as 1E + 4E + 9E + 25E = 39E. For the second excited state, the quantum numbers will be 1, 2, 4, and 5, giving energies E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_4 = 16E, and E_5 = 25E. Summing these gives the second excited state energy as 1E + 4E + 16E + 25E = 46E. However, this value does not match any of the provided options, so there might be a mistake in the expected answer or the options. The closest match to the provided options is 30E, 39E, 50E, which is consistent with the reasoning of some agents.
