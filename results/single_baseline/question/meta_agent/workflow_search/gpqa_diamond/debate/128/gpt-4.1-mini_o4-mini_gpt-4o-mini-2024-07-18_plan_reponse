        "response": "Compound A is identified by the Wittig reaction product as 2,3-dimethylcyclopentanone (IR ~1750 cm\u207b\u00b9). Reaction with HCN gives the cyanohydrin, whose nitrile is hydrogenated to the \u03b1-amino alcohol. Diazotization with HNO\u2082 forms a diazonium that loses N\u2082 and undergoes a Demjanov (ring-expansion) rearrangement, converting the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring ketone. The IR shift to ~1715 cm\u207b\u00b9 confirms cyclohexanone. The two original methyls end up at positions 3 and 4 of the new ring, so E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
