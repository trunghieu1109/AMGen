            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",
            "Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells",
            "Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ",

        "response": "To determine which experiment will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug, we need to evaluate each option's relevance to mitochondrial function. Choice 1 involves luciferase and luminometer reading, which measures ATP levels and is indirectly related to mitochondrial function. Choice 2 involves confocal fluorescence microscopy with Mito-RTP, which directly visualizes mitochondria. Choice 3 involves differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay, which measures glucose metabolism and is not directly related to mitochondrial function. Choice 4 involves flow cytometry with a dye for mitochondrial membrane potential, directly assessing mitochondrial health. The experiment that does not directly assess mitochondrial function is choice 3, as it focuses on glucose uptake rather than mitochondria specifically.\n\nAnswer:C)",
