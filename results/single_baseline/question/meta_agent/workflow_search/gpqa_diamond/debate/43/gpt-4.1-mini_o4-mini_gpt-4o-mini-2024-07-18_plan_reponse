            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",
            "Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells",
            "Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "We need to identify which experiment will not inform on mitochondrial function. The luciferase assay measures cellular ATP (reflecting mitochondrial activity), Mito-RTP staining visualizes mitochondria, and JC-1 (tetrachloro-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine) flow cytometry assesses mitochondrial membrane potential. A glucose uptake assay on isolated mitochondria is irrelevant because mitochondria do not directly uptake glucose. Therefore, choice 3 will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug.\n\nAnswer:C)",
