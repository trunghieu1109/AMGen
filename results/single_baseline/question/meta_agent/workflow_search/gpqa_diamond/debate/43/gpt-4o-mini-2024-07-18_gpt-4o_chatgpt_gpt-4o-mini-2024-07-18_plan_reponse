            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",
            "Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells",
            "Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ",

        "response": "To determine which experiment will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug, we need to evaluate each option for its relevance to mitochondrial function. Choice 1 involves luciferase activity, which measures ATP levels and general cellular energy status, not specifically mitochondrial function. Choice 2 uses Mito-RTP staining, which directly assesses mitochondria, making it relevant. Choice 3 involves glucose uptake assays after mitochondrial extraction, which is more related to cellular metabolism rather than direct mitochondrial function. Choice 4 uses a dye that assesses mitochondrial membrane potential, directly related to mitochondrial function. Therefore, the experiment least likely to help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug is Choice 3, as glucose uptake assays are not specifically related to mitochondrial function.\n\nAnswer:C)",
