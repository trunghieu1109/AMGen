Question: Example(question='Determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis.', choice1='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene', choice2='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene', choice3='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', choice4='4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Ring‐closing metathesis to form cyclohexene requires an ω,α‐diene (an octa‐1,7‐diene). Closure between the terminal alkenes at C1 and C7 gives a six‐membered ring with the alkene between ring positions 1 and 2. Substituents on chain carbons 3 and 4 become ring positions 3 and 4 (dimethyl) and on chain carbon 5 becomes ring position 5 (isopropyl). Only 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene meets these criteria.
