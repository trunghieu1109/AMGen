        "response": "Ring\u2010closing metathesis to form cyclohexene requires an \u03c9,\u03b1\u2010diene (an octa\u20101,7\u2010diene). Closure between the terminal alkenes at C1 and C7 gives a six\u2010membered ring with the alkene between ring positions 1 and 2. Substituents on chain carbons 3 and 4 become ring positions 3 and 4 (dimethyl) and on chain carbon 5 becomes ring position 5 (isopropyl). Only 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene meets these criteria.\n\nAnswer:C)",
