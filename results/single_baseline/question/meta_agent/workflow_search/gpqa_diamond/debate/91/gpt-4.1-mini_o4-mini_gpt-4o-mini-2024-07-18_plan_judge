Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: First, determine the molecular formula and count all bonds in (CH3)2C=CH–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH=C(CH3)2: there are 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms, giving 22 C–H bonds, 9 C–C single bonds, and 2 C=C double bonds. 

Energy required to atomize the elements:
• 12 C atoms: 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ
• 11 H2 molecules (to supply 22 H atoms): 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ
Total input = 13100 kJ

Energy released in forming the bonds in the molecule:
• C–H: 22 × 400 = 8800 kJ
• C–C:  9 × 200 = 1800 kJ
• C=C:  2 × 300 =  600 kJ
Total release = 11200 kJ

Net enthalpy of formation ΔHf = energy in – energy out = 13100 – 11200 = +1900 kJ/mol, which corresponds to choice 2.
