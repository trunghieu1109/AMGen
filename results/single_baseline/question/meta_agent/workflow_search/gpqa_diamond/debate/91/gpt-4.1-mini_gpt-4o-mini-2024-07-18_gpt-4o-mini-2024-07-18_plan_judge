Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we need to analyze the molecular structure and count the number of each type of bond present. The bond energies provided will be used to calculate the total energy required to break these bonds and the energy released when forming the bonds in the compound. After performing the calculations step by step, we find that the enthalpy of formation is 11200 kJ/mol, which matches the first choice provided.
