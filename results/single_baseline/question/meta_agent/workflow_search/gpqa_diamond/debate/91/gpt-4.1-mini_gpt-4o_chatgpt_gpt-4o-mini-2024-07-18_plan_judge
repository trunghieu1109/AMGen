Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The task is to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound using the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which is a complex alkene. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy of the bonds formed in the compound. The agents have provided different calculations, but the most consistent approach involves calculating the total bond energies for the compound and comparing it to the atomization energies. The closest choice to the calculated enthalpy of formation, considering potential errors or assumptions, is 11200 kJ/mol.
