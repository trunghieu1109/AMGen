    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’&lt;b&gt;&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Mutant 2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Mutant 4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;Mutant 1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Mutant 3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent valg:
We need a mutation that abolishes enzyme function so no anti-nutritional compound is made. Examining the mutants near the start codons: Mutant 2 changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAA, creating an early stop codon and truncating the protein — most likely a loss-of-function. The others only cause missense changes. Therefore Mutant 2 will eliminate the compound.

### thinking by Debate Agent Hc50:
We seek the mutation that most effectively abolishes gene function by introducing a premature stop codon or frameshift near the N-terminus. Examining each: Mutant 1 has a missense (Leu→Tyr), Mutant 3 and 4 have multiple missense changes but no stops, whereas Mutant 2 converts the third codon to TAA, generating a stop codon at position 3 and truncating the protein. This is most likely to eliminate enzyme activity.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6t49:
The intact sequence codes Met-Phe-Leu-Ala… Mutant 1 has a synonymous (TTT→TTC) and a missense (CTC→TAC) mutation but keeps the reading frame and no stop codon. Mutant 2 introduces TAA as the third codon, creating an early stop (nonsense) and truncating the protein, likely abolishing enzyme activity and eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. Mutants 3 and 4 only have missense changes with no premature stop. Thus Mutant 2 is the most effective loss-of-function mutation.

### thinking by Debate Agent VrPK:
We need to find which mutation introduces a premature stop codon early in the first exon, truncating the enzyme and preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The wild‐type sequence starts ATG TTT CTC… Mutant 2 changes the third codon to TAA, a stop. This truncates translation almost immediately and abolishes enzyme function. The other mutants only cause missense changes. Thus Mutant 2 is the correct choice, corresponding to A).
