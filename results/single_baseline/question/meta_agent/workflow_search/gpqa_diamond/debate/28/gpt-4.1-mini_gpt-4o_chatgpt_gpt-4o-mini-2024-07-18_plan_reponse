            "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>",

        "response": "To determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can be achieved by introducing a frameshift mutation or a premature stop codon. Analyzing the mutants: \n\n- Mutant 1: A missense mutation that changes 'TTT' to 'TAC', unlikely to disrupt the protein function significantly.\n- Mutant 2: A missense mutation that changes 'TTT' to 'AAG', unlikely to disrupt the protein function significantly.\n- Mutant 3: A frameshift mutation due to an extra 'T', likely to disrupt the protein function.\n- Mutant 4: A frameshift mutation due to a deletion, likely to disrupt the protein function.\n\nMutant 4 introduces a frameshift early in the gene, which is most likely to eliminate the function of the gene responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAnswer:B)",
