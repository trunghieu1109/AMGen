Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, likely by introducing a premature stop codon or a frameshift that significantly alters the protein structure. Analyzing the mutants: Mutant 1 and Mutant 2 involve single nucleotide changes that do not introduce a stop codon or frameshift. Mutant 3 introduces a frameshift mutation, which is likely to disrupt the protein function by altering the reading frame. Mutant 4 involves a deletion that could potentially cause a frameshift, but without more information, it's unclear if it introduces a stop codon. Given the options, Mutant 3 is the most likely to disrupt the gene function due to the frameshift, which would lead to a nonfunctional protein and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
