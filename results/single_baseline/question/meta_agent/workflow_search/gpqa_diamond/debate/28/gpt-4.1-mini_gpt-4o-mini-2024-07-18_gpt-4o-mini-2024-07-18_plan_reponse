            "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>",

        "response": "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the changes in the sequence of each mutant compared to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with 'ATGTTT' and has important codons that may be affected by the mutations. The goal is to find a mutation that might disrupt the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Mutant 1 has a change from 'TTT' to 'TAC', Mutant 2 changes 'TTT' to 'TAA', Mutant 3 changes 'TTT' to 'TTT' (no change), and Mutant 4 changes 'TTT' to 'TTT' (no change). The mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon ('TAA') which would likely terminate translation prematurely, possibly preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAnswer:B",
