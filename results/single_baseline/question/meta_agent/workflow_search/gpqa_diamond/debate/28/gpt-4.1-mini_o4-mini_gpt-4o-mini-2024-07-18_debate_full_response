Examining the mutants near the start codons: Mutant 2 changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAA, creating an early stop codon and truncating the protein — most likely a loss-of-function. The others only cause missense changes. Therefore Mutant 2 will eliminate the compound.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Hc50:\nWe seek the mutation that most effectively abolishes gene function by introducing a premature stop codon or frameshift near the N-terminus. Examining each: Mutant 1 has a missense (Leu→Tyr), Mutant 3 and 4 have multiple missense changes but no stops, whereas Mutant 2 converts the third codon to TAA, generating a stop codon at position 3 and truncating the protein. This is most likely to eliminate enzyme activity.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6t49:\nThe intact sequence codes Met-Phe-Leu-Ala… Mutant 1 has a synonymous (TTT→TTC) and a missense (CTC→TAC) mutation but keeps the reading frame and no stop codon. Mutant 2 introduces TAA as the third codon, creating an early stop (nonsense) and truncating the protein, likely abolishing enzyme activity and eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. Mutants 3 and 4 only have missense changes with no premature stop. Thus Mutant 2 is the most effective loss-of-function mutation.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent VrPK:\nWe need to find which mutation introduces a premature stop codon early in the first exon, truncating the enzyme and preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The wild‐type sequence starts ATG TTT CTC… Mutant 2 changes the third codon to TAA, a stop. This truncates translation almost immediately and abolishes enzyme function. The other mutants only cause missense changes. Thus Mutant 2 is the correct choice, corresponding to A).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent valg:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Hc50:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6t49:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent VrPK:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
