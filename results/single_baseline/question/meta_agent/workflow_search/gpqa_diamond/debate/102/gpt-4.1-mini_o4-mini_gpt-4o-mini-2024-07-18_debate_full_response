The key is to install the acetyl group first (Friedel–Crafts acetylation) to get acetophenone, which is a meta-director. Next, bromination on acetophenone gives 3-bromoacetophenone (ortho to the acetyl is sterically hindered, so the meta-directed bromination major product is at C-3). Finally, nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone places a nitro group at C-5 (the only open meta position relative to the acetyl group, since C-3 is already substituted by Br). This three-step sequence gives the target in high yield.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent WhNp:\nWe need to install an acetyl group first (Friedel–Crafts acylation) to make acetophenone, then use its meta-directing deactivator nature to guide bromination to C-3, and finally nitrate to the remaining meta position (C-5).  Only sequence 4 begins with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Br₂/FeBr₃ → HNO₃/H₂SO₄ to give 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield.  The extra steps are unnecessary, so choice 4 is the direct high-yield route.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent V4BQ:\nWe need 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, i.e. an acetophenone with Br and NO2 both meta to the –COCH3. The –COCH3 group is a meta‐director, so we first do Friedel–Crafts acylation on benzene to get acetophenone. Next, acetophenone is deactivated and meta‐directing, so bromination gives 3-bromoacetophenone. Finally, nitration of that deactivated ring places NO2 meta to –COCH3 (position 5 relative to COCH3, since 3 is occupied by Br). High yield is obtained by this simple three‐step route: acylation → bromination → nitration. Among the given choices only option 4 has those first three steps in the correct order (CH3COCl/AlCl3; Br2/FeBr3; HNO3/H2SO4).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent v0zK:\nWe need to install the acetyl group first (meta‐director), then brominate (meta to COCH3), then nitrate (the only remaining meta position) to get 1‐(3‐bromo‐5‐nitrophenyl)ethan‐1‐one in high yield.
