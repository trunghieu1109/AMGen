            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "In electrochemistry, oxygen is generally considered a stronger oxidant in basic solutions due to its higher reduction potential. Kinetically, reactions involving oxygen tend to be slower in acidic solutions because the presence of protons can inhibit certain pathways. Therefore, the correct combination is that oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions and reacts slower in acidic solutions.\n\nAnswer:stronger \u2013 slower",
