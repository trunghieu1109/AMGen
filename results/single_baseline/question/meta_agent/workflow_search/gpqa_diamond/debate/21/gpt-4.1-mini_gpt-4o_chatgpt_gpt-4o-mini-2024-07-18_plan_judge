Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks about the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen in different pH environments. Thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions because the reduction potential of oxygen is more favorable in basic conditions. Kinetically, reactions involving oxygen tend to proceed faster in acidic solutions due to the higher concentration of protons, which can facilitate the reaction mechanism. Therefore, the correct combination is stronger - faster.
