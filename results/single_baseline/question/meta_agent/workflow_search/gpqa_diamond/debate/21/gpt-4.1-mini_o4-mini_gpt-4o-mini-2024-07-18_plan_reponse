            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",
            "weaker \u2013 faster",
            "stronger \u2013 slower",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The standard reduction potential of O2 in acidic solution (O2 + 4H+ + 4e\u2013 \u2192 2H2O) is +1.229 V, while in basic solution (O2 + 2H2O + 4e\u2013 \u2192 4OH\u2013) it\u2019s only +0.401 V. A lower potential means O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic media. Kinetically, the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds more rapidly in acidic solutions due to abundant protons and higher exchange current densities. Therefore, oxygen is thermodynamically weaker in basic solutions but reacts faster in acidic solutions, corresponding to choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
