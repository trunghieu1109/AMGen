Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The standard reduction potential of O2 in acidic solution (O2 + 4H+ + 4e– → 2H2O) is +1.229 V, while in basic solution (O2 + 2H2O + 4e– → 4OH–) it’s only +0.401 V. A lower potential means O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic media. Kinetically, the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds more rapidly in acidic solutions due to abundant protons and higher exchange current densities. Therefore, oxygen is thermodynamically weaker in basic solutions but reacts faster in acidic solutions, corresponding to choice A).
