        "response": "All agents agree that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities at high energies. Superstring Theory is believed to be finite and does not require regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics are quantum field theories that require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve quantum field theoretical infinities, so it does not require regularization in the same context as quantum theories. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is Classical Electrodynamics.\n\nAnswer:D)",
