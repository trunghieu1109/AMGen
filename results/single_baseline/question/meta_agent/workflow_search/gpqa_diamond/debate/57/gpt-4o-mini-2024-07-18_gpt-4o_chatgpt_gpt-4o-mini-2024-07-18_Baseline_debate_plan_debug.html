### thinking by Debate Agent DjUU:
Regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Superstring Theory is a candidate for a theory of everything and is considered finite, meaning it doesn&#39;t require regularization in the same way as other quantum field theories. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that do require regularization at high energies. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not inherently involve the infinities that arise in quantum theories, so it does not require regularization in the same context.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7yCH:
Regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Superstring Theory is a candidate for a theory of everything and is expected to be finite, thus not requiring regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that typically require regularization to deal with infinities. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not involve quantum mechanics&#39; high-energy infinities and thus does not require regularization in the same context as quantum theories.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3Rbm:
Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise in calculations. Superstring Theory is a candidate for a theory of everything and is believed to be finite and free of such infinities, hence it does not require regularization in the same way as other quantum field theories. Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics are quantum field theories that require regularization to handle infinities. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not deal with quantum infinities and thus does not require regularization in the quantum sense. However, it does not operate at high energies in the quantum realm, so it is not typically subject to the same issues. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies, in the context of quantum theories, is Superstring Theory.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0K2z:
Regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) both require regularization to deal with such infinities. Superstring Theory, on the other hand, is a theoretical framework that is expected to be finite and self-consistent at all energy scales, thus not requiring regularization in the same way as QED and QCD. Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory, not a quantum one, and does not involve the same kind of infinities that arise in quantum field theories, thus it does not require regularization at high energies. Therefore, the correct answer is Classical Electrodynamics.

### answer by Debate Agent DjUU:
D) Classical Electrodynamics

### answer by Debate Agent 7yCH:
D) Classical Electrodynamics

### answer by Debate Agent 3Rbm:

    <pre>The question asks which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Regularization is typically a concern in quantum field theories to handle infinities. Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that is expected to be finite and not require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve the same quantum infinities, so it does not require regularization in the quantum sense. However, the context of the question seems to focus on quantum theories, where Superstring Theory is the one that is considered finite and self-consistent without the need for regularization. Therefore, the correct answer is Superstring Theory.
