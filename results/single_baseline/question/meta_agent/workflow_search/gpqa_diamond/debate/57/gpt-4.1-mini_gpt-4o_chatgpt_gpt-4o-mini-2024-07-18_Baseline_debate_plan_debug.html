### thinking by Debate Agent DjUU:
Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Superstring Theory is a candidate for a unified theory of physics and is believed to be finite, thus not requiring regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are both quantum field theories that require regularization to handle infinities. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not involve quantum field theoretical infinities and thus does not require regularization in the same context as quantum theories. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is Classical Electrodynamics.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7yCH:
Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that require regularization to deal with divergences. Superstring Theory is a theoretical framework that inherently avoids these divergences by its construction, as it is formulated to be finite and consistent at all energy scales. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is not a quantum theory and does not require regularization in the same sense as quantum theories do because it does not deal with quantum fluctuations. Therefore, among the choices, Classical Electrodynamics never requires regularization at high energies.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3Rbm:
Regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise at high energies. Superstring Theory is a theoretical framework that naturally incorporates gravity and is expected to be finite without the need for regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that require regularization techniques like renormalization to deal with infinities. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory and does not involve quantum corrections or infinities that require regularization at high energies. Therefore, it does not require regularization in the same sense as quantum theories.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0K2z:
Regularization is a process in theoretical physics used to handle infinities arising in calculations. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that require regularization to deal with divergences at high energies. Superstring Theory, as a candidate for a unified theory of all forces, is constructed to be finite and does not require regularization in the same way as these quantum field theories. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not encounter the same issues with infinities as quantum field theories do, but it is not typically discussed in the context of regularization at high energies because it does not apply at quantum scales. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is Classical Electrodynamics.

    <pre>All agents agree that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities at high energies. Superstring Theory is believed to be finite and does not require regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics are quantum field theories that require regularization.
