        "response": "To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze each option. Superstring Theory, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) all encounter divergences at high energies and require regularization. In contrast, Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory that does not face these high-energy divergences, as it does not incorporate quantum effects. Therefore, Classical Electrodynamics is the only theory listed that does not require regularization at high energies.\n\nAnswer:D",
