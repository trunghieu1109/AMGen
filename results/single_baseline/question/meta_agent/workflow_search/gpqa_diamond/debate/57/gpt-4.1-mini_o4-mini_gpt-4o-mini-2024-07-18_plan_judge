Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Superstring Theory is a UV-complete theory of extended objects with finite perturbative amplitudes, and thus never requires regularization at high energies. Other theories like QED, QCD, and classical electrodynamics exhibit ultraviolet divergences and need regularization or renormalization.
