### thinking by Debate Agent 7yCH:
To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we need to analyze each option. Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that often requires regularization due to its complex interactions at high energies. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) also requires regularization to handle divergences. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), like QED, also faces issues with divergences at high energies and requires regularization. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory that does not encounter these high-energy divergences, as it does not incorporate quantum effects. Therefore, Classical Electrodynamics is the only theory listed that does not require regularization at high energies.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3Rbm:
To determine which physical theory does not require regularization at high energies, we need to analyze each choice. Superstring Theory is a candidate that avoids some of the divergences present in other theories due to its fundamental nature. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) does require regularization to handle infinities at high energies. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) also faces similar issues with divergences and requires regularization. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory and does not encounter the same high-energy divergences as quantum theories. Therefore, Classical Electrodynamics is the only theory listed that does not require regularization at high energies.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0K2z:
Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with infinities that arise at high energies. Superstring Theory, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) all encounter such infinities and require regularization methods to make sense of their predictions at high energies. On the other hand, Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not involve quantum effects and does not face the same issues with infinities at high energies. Therefore, it does not require regularization.

### thinking by Debate Agent na9i:
Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with infinities that arise at high energies or short distances. Among the options listed, Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve quantum effects that lead to such divergences, thus it does not require regularization at high energies. The other theories listed are quantum field theories which typically encounter these issues.
