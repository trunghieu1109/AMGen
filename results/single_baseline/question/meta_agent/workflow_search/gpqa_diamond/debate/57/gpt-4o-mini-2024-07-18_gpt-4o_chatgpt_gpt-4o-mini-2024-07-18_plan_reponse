        "response": "The question asks which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Regularization is typically a concern in quantum field theories to handle infinities. Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that is expected to be finite and not require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve the same quantum infinities, so it does not require regularization in the quantum sense. However, the context of the question seems to focus on quantum theories, where Superstring Theory is the one that is considered finite and self-consistent without the need for regularization. Therefore, the correct answer is Superstring Theory.\n\nAnswer:A)",
