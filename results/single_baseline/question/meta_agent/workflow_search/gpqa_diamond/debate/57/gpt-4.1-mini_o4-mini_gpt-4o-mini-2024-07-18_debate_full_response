Regularization is used to control infinities in quantum field theories. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are both quantum field theories that require renormalization and regularization at high energies. Classical Electrodynamics also leads to divergences (e.g., self-energy of a point charge) and requires regularization if one tries to quantize or extend it. Superstring Theory, on the other hand, is a candidate for a UV-complete theory of quantum gravity and is finite at high energies without needing additional regularization.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7yCH:\nWe examine each theory for ultraviolet (high‐energy) divergences:\n\n1. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory of electrons and photons. It exhibits ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams and requires regularization and renormalization.\n\n2. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the quantum field theory of quarks and gluons. It also has ultraviolet divergences that are handled by renormalization.\n\n3. Classical Electrodynamics, when treated with point charges, leads to infinite self‐energy of a point charge—effectively a divergence at short distances (high energies) that requires a cutoff or some regularization.\n\n4. Superstring Theory replaces point particles with one‐dimensional strings. The extended nature of strings leads to a built‐in cutoff at the string scale, and all perturbative amplitudes are finite without any need for additional regularization at high energies.\n\nTherefore, among the options, only Superstring Theory never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 3Rbm:\nThe user asks which theory never requires regularization at high energies. QED and QCD both need renormalization to deal with ultraviolet divergences. Classical electrodynamics has divergence issues in point-charge self-energy, but it’s not a UV-complete quantum theory and still has infinities. Superstring theory, being a theory of extended objects, yields finite high-energy amplitudes without UV divergences and thus needs no regularization at high energies.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 0K2z:\nWe compare the four theories for ultraviolet (high-energy) behavior. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that exhibit divergences at high energies and thus require regularization and renormalization. Classical Electrodynamics also has divergences (e.g., infinite self-energy of a point charge) and doesn’t remain valid at arbitrarily high energies—the notion of regularization applies in its own way. Superstring Theory, by contrast, is a proposed quantum theory of gravity that is UV-complete: its extended objects smooth out interactions at very short distances, and the theory remains finite without needing ad hoc regularization at high energies.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DjUU:\nA\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 7yCH:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3Rbm:\nA\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 0K2z:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
