        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The reactions involve the formation of a cyanohydrin and the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The first reaction requires an acidic condition to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, making H3O+ a suitable choice for A. The second reaction involves hydrolysis of a nitrile, which is typically done in acidic conditions, making HCl a suitable choice for B. Therefore, the suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which corresponds to choice D.\n\nAnswer:D)",
