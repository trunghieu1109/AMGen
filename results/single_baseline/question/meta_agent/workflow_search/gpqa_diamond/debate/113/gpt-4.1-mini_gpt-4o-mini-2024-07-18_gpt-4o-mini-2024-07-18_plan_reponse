        "response": "To determine the suitable reagents for the reactions described, we analyze each reaction step. The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN, which typically requires an acid catalyst to facilitate the addition of hydroxyl groups. Therefore, A should be an acid like H3O+. The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile compound to a carboxylic acid, which is often facilitated by water in the presence of an acid. B should be an acid like CH3COOH. Evaluating the options, the correct choice is A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.\n\nAnswer:A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH",
