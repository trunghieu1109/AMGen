        "response": "The first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which requires an acidic condition to stabilize the intermediate. H3O+ is a suitable acid for this purpose. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which also requires acidic conditions. HCl is a common acid used for this hydrolysis. Therefore, the suitable reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which corresponds to choice D.\n\nAnswer:D)",
