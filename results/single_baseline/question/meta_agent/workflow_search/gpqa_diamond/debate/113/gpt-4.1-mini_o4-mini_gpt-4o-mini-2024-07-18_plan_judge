Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Cyanohydrin formation from butan-2-one and NaCN requires acid catalysis to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, so A = H3O+. Hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid requires strong acid conditions (HCl), so B = HCl. This corresponds to choice 4 (D).
