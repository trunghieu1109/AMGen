Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires strong acid catalysis, so B = HCl.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1Dfi:\nFormation of cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN requires acidic workup to protonate the alkoxide–cyanide addition intermediate, so A must be H3O+. Hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid typically uses strong acidic conditions (e.g., HCl). Thus A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is choice 4 (D).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6IXe:\nIn the first step, NaCN adds CN⁻ to the carbonyl of butan-2-one. To protonate the resulting alkoxide and form the cyanohydrin, a strong acid (H₃O⁺) is required rather than a weak acid (CH₃COOH) or bisulfite (NaHSO₃). In the second step, hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid proceeds best under strong acid conditions (HCl). Thus A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponding to choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eWhY:\nWe need the reagent A for cyanohydrin formation from a ketone and NaCN; this is acid-catalyzed, so A = H3O+. Next, hydrolysis of a nitrile to carboxylic acid requires strong acid (HCl) with water, so B = HCl. That corresponds to choice 4.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent dcc2:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1Dfi:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6IXe:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eWhY:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
