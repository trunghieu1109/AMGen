            "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ",

        "response": "All agents agree that the key factor affecting the rate of the reaction is the change in pH. The reaction initially had a high concentration of H+ ions at pH 1, and the accidental addition of an unknown substance increased the pH to 4, indicating a decrease in H+ ion concentration. This decrease in acidity is likely to slow down the reaction rate if the reaction depends on high acidity. Although the reaction was exothermic, the increase in temperature is not the primary reason for the slower reaction rate, as exothermic reactions typically increase the rate. Therefore, the increased pH of the solution is the most plausible reason for the change in the rate of reaction.\n\nAnswer:D)",
