            "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ",

        "response": "All agents agree that the key factor affecting the rate of the reaction is the change in pH. Initially, the reaction was at pH 1, indicating a high concentration of H+ ions. The accidental addition increased the pH to 4, which means the concentration of H+ ions decreased significantly. Since the reaction involves H+ ions, a decrease in their concentration would slow down the reaction rate. The exothermic nature of the accidental reaction caused the container to get hot, but the primary reason for the change in the rate of the original reaction is the increased pH, not the temperature or volume changes.\n\nAnswer:D)",
