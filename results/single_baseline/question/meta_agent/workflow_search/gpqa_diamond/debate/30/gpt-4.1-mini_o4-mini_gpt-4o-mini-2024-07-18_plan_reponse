        "response": "Step 1: Toluene nitrates to give mainly p-nitrotoluene (1). Step 2: MnO2/H2SO4 oxidizes the benzylic methyl of p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde (2). Step 3: Aldol condensation of two equivalents of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone under base gives the symmetric 4,4\u2032-dinitro-dibenzalacetone (3), a planar molecule. 3 has a single C2 axis through the center of the molecule (180\u00b0 rotation swaps the two identical halves) and a mirror plane in the molecular plane (\u03c3h), as well as an inversion center arising from the combination of those operations. This point group is C2h.\n\nAnswer:B)",
