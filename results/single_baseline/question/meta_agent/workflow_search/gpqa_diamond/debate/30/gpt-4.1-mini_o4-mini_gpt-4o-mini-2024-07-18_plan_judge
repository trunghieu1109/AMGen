Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Step 1: Toluene nitrates to give mainly p-nitrotoluene (1). Step 2: MnO2/H2SO4 oxidizes the benzylic methyl of p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde (2). Step 3: Aldol condensation of two equivalents of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone under base gives the symmetric 4,4′-dinitro-dibenzalacetone (3), a planar molecule. 3 has a single C2 axis through the center of the molecule (180° rotation swaps the two identical halves) and a mirror plane in the molecular plane (σh), as well as an inversion center arising from the combination of those operations. This point group is C2h.
