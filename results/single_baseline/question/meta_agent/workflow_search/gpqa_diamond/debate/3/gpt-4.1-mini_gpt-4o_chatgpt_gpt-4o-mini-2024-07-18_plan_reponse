        "response": "In our universe, Maxwell's equations include Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, indicating no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to account for a non-zero divergence of the magnetic field. Additionally, the presence of magnetic monopoles would affect the curl of the magnetic field, as it would include a term related to the magnetic current density, similar to how the curl of the electric field includes a term related to the electric current density. Therefore, both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field equations would be different in a universe with magnetic monopoles.\n\nAnswer:B)",
