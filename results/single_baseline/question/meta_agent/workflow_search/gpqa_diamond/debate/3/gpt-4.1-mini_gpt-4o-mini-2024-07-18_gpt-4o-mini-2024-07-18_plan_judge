Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwellâ€™s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In a parallel universe where isolated magnetic poles exist, the equations of electromagnetism would need to be modified. Specifically, the divergence of the magnetic field, which is currently zero in our universe, would need to be changed to account for the presence of magnetic monopoles. Additionally, the curl of the magnetic field may also be affected due to the relationship between electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, the equations that would change are those related to both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. This leads to the conclusion that the correct choice is the one that states both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field are different.
