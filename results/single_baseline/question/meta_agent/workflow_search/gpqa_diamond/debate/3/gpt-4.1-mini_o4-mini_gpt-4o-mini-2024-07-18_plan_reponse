        "response": "Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density \u03c1m so Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B=0) becomes \u2207\u00b7B=\u03bc0\u03c1m, and consistency also requires a magnetic current density jm term in Faraday\u2019s law (\u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\u2202B/\u2202t) so it becomes \u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\u2202B/\u2202t\u2212\u03bc0jm. Thus the two modified Maxwell\u2019s equations are the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E.\n\nAnswer:C)",
