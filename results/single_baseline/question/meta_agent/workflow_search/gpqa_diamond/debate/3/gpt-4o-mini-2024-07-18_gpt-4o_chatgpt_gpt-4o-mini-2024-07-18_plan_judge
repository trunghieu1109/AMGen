Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the equations related to the magnetic field would need to be modified. Specifically, Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, would change to account for a non-zero divergence due to the presence of magnetic charge. Additionally, Ampère's law, which involves the curl of the magnetic field, would also be modified to include a term for magnetic current density. Therefore, both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field equations would be different.
