### thinking by Debate Agent DQVo:
In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B = 0) becomes ∇·B = μ0ρm, and Faraday’s law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) acquires a magnetic current term, ∇×E = -μ0Jm - ∂B/∂t. Thus the equations involving the divergence of B and the curl (circulation) of E change.

### thinking by Debate Agent Vr9h:
In standard Maxwell’s equations, ∇·B=0 and Faraday’s law ∇×E=−∂B/∂t (no magnetic current term). Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density ρm so ∇·B=μ0ρm≠0, and a magnetic current density jm so Faraday’s law becomes ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−jm. Thus the equations for the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E are modified.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2cpG:
In standard electromagnetism without magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism is ∇·B=0 and Faraday’s law is ∇×E=−∂B/∂t. Introducing isolated magnetic charges ρm makes Gauss’s law for B become ∇·B=ρm, and consistency (symmetry) also adds a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law: ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−Jm. Thus the two Maxwell equations that change are the divergence of B and the curl (circulation) of E.

### thinking by Debate Agent Kygp:
In a theory with magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism (div B=0) becomes div B=ρ_m (nonzero magnetic charge density), and Faraday’s law (curl E=–∂B/∂t) acquires a magnetic current term (curl E=–∂B/∂t–J_m). Thus the equations for the divergence of B and the circulation of E change.
