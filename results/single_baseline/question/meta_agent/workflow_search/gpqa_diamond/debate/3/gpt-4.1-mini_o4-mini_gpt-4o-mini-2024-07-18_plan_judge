Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Introducing magnetic monopoles adds a magnetic charge density ρm so Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) becomes ∇·B=μ0ρm, and consistency also requires a magnetic current density jm term in Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t) so it becomes ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−μ0jm. Thus the two modified Maxwell’s equations are the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E.
