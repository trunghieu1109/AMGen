An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0).

### thinking by Debate Agent wcnB:
We have state |φ⟩ = (–1, 2, 1)ᵀ. First normalize: ⟨φ|φ⟩ = 1+4+1 = 6, so |φ_norm⟩ = (1/√6)(–1, 2, 1). The observable P is the tridiagonal matrix with off‐diagonal entries 1/√2. Its eigenvalues are ±1 and 0. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is proportional to (1, 0, –1), normalized to |ψ₀⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, –1). Compute amplitude ⟨ψ₀|φ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, –1)·(1/√6)(–1, 2, 1) = 1/(√12)(–1–1) = –1/√3. Probability = |–1/√3|² = 1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent MW1W:
We have state |ψ&gt; = (-1,2,1) (unnormalized) and observable P with matrix elements P = [[0,a,0],[a,0,a],[0,a,0]] where a=1/√2. Its eigenvalues are ±1,0. The projector onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace is |u₀&gt;&lt;u₀|, where |u₀&gt; ∝ (1,0,-1). Normalizing gives |u₀&gt; = (1/√2,0,−1/√2). The probability to measure 0 is ⟨ψ|u₀⟩⟨u₀|ψ⟩/⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |⟨u₀|ψ⟩|²/||ψ||². Compute ⟨u₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1)+(−1/√2)(1)= -2/√2 = -√2 ⇒ |…|²=2. Norm² of ψ is 1+4+1=6. So probability =2/6=1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent UKlP:
We have state vector ψ=(−1,2,1) (not normalized) and observable P=
[0,1/√2,0;
 1/√2,0,1/√2;
 0,1/√2,0]. P’s eigenvalues for a 3×3 tridiagonal matrix with off‐diagonals a=1/√2 are λ_k=2a cos(kπ/4): k=1→1, k=2→0, k=3→−1. We want the eigenvalue 0. Its normalized eigenvector is v0∝(sin(π/2),sin(π),sin(3π/2))=(1,0,−1) with norm √2, so v0=(1/√2,0,−1/√2).

Normalize ψ: ||ψ||²=1+4+1=6 so |ψ⟩=ψ/√6. Overlap ⟨v0|ψ⟩=(1/√2)(−1)+(−1/√2)(1)=−2/√2=−√2. Then ⟨v0|ψ_norm⟩=−√2/√6=−1/√3. Probability=|−1/√3|²=1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent Rqxs:
We have state |ψ&gt; = (-1,2,1)^T. Observable P = [[0,1/√2,0],[1/√2,0,1/√2],[0,1/√2,0]]. Its eigenvalues are λ=1,0,−1. The 0‐eigenvector satisfies P v=0 ⇒ v∝(1,0,−1). Normalized v₀=(1/√2)(1,0,−1). Normalize |ψ&gt;: ||ψ||²=1+4+1=6, so |ψ_norm&gt;=(1/√6)(-1,2,1). Then amplitude &lt;v₀|ψ_norm&gt; = (1/√2)(1,0,−1)·(1/√6)(-1,2,1)=(-2)/(2√3)= -1/√3. Probability=|−1/√3|²=1/3.
