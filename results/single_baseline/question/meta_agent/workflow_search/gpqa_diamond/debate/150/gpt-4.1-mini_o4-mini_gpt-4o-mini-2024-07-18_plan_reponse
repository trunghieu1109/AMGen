            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.",

The observable P has eigenvalues 1,0,\u20131; the 0\u2013eigenvector is v\u2080\u221d(1,0,\u20131), normalized to (1/\u221a2)(1,0,\u20131). Compute the overlap \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8_norm\u27e9=(1/\u221a2\u27e81,0,\u20131|)(1/\u221a6)(\u20131,2,1)=\u22121/\u221a3. The measurement probability is |\u22121/\u221a3|\u00b2=1/3.\n\nAnswer:A)",
