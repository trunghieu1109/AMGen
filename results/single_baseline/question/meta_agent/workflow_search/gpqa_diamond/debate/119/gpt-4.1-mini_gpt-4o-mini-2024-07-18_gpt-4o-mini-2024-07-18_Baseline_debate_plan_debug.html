### thinking by Debate Agent CHBM:
In astronomy, the parallax of a star is inversely related to its distance from Earth. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a certain volume of space will depend on the distance. The volume of space corresponding to a range of parallax can be expressed in terms of the distance, which is inversely proportional to the parallax (plx). Specifically, distance (d) is given by d = 1/plx (in parsecs if plx is in arcseconds). The volume of a sphere of radius d is proportional to d^3. Since d is inversely proportional to plx, the volume can be expressed as being proportional to (1/plx)^3. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is proportional to the volume, which leads to the conclusion that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~1/plx^3.

### thinking by Debate Agent uYwV:
When considering the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we need to understand that parallax is inversely related to the distance of a star. If stars are uniformly distributed, the volume of space increases with distance cubed (since volume is proportional to distance cubed). Therefore, as parallax decreases (which means stars are further away), the number of stars per unit parallax will decrease with the cube of the distance, leading to a relationship of ~ 1/plx^3.

### thinking by Debate Agent bwD3:
In astronomy, the parallax of a star is inversely related to its distance from the observer. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars per unit volume increases as they get closer (which corresponds to a larger parallax). The relationship between distance (d) and parallax (plx) is given by d = 1/plx (in parsecs for plx in arcseconds). Therefore, the volume element in three-dimensional space increases with the cube of the distance, leading to a relationship where the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^3. This means that as parallax increases (indicating closer stars), the density of stars increases sharply due to the geometric effect of volume in three dimensions.

### thinking by Debate Agent STN3:
In a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars observed increases as the distance decreases. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance: a larger parallax indicates a closer star. The volume of space available for stars increases with the cube of the distance, which means the number of stars per unit range of parallax will decrease as the parallax increases. Therefore, the relationship is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the cube of the parallax, leading to the conclusion that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx as ~ 1/plx^3.

This reasoning is supported by multiple agents who arrived at the same conclusion, confirming the relationship is indeed ~1/plx^3.
