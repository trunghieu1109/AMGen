        "response": "In astronomy, the parallax of a star is inversely related to its distance from Earth. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a certain volume of space will depend on the distance. The volume of space corresponding to a range of parallax can be expressed in terms of the distance, which is inversely proportional to the parallax (plx). Specifically, distance (d) is given by d = 1/plx (in parsecs if plx is in arcseconds). The volume of a sphere of radius d is proportional to d^3. Since d is inversely proportional to plx, the volume can be expressed as being proportional to (1/plx)^3. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) is proportional to the volume, which leads to the conclusion that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~1/plx^3. This reasoning is supported by multiple agents who arrived at the same conclusion, confirming the relationship is indeed ~1/plx^3.\n\nAnswer:A",
