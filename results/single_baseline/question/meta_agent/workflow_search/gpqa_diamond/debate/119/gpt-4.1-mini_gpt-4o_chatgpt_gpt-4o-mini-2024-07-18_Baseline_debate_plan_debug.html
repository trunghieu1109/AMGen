    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 1/plx^3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 1/plx^2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 1/plx^1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1/plx^4&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent m7NU:
The number of stars per unit volume is constant due to uniform distribution. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness delta d is proportional to d^2 * delta d. Converting this to parallax, the volume is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * delta(1/plx), which simplifies to 1/plx^4 * delta plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3CHB:
The number of stars per unit volume is constant due to the uniform distribution of stars. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. Therefore, the volume of a shell at a distance d is proportional to d^2. Since plx = 1/d, the volume is proportional to 1/plx^2. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then proportional to this volume, which means it is proportional to 1/plx^2.

### thinking by Debate Agent MuYw:
The number of stars per unit volume is uniform. The volume of a spherical shell at a distance corresponding to parallax plx is proportional to 1/plx^3. The number of stars in such a shell is proportional to its volume. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the differential of volume with respect to plx, which is ~1/plx^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent VbwD:
To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx, we need to consider the relationship between distance and parallax. The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at a distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, the differential dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). The number of stars per unit range of plx is then proportional to 4π(1/plx)^2(-1/plx^2)d(plx) = 4π/plx^4 d(plx). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.
