Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For a uniform spatial density, the number of stars in a shell at distance d of thickness dd is ∝ d^2 dd. Since parallax plx p = 1/d, we have d = 1/p and dd = dp/p^2. Substituting gives N per unit parallax ∝ (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) = 1/p^4.
