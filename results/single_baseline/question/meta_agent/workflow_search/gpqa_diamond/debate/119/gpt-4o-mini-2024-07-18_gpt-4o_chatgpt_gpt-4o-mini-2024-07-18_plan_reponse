        "response": "The problem involves understanding how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax when stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a shell at distance d is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4\u03c0d^2dr. In terms of parallax, d = 1/plx, and the thickness of the shell in terms of parallax is dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Substituting these into the volume expression gives the number of stars proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx) = 1/plx^4 d(plx). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. This matches the reasoning of Debate Agents 3CHB and VbwD, who both concluded that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~ 1/plx^4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
