### thinking by Debate Agent m7NU:
We assume stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a shell between distances d and d+dd is dN = 4πd^2 n dd. Parallax p (in arcseconds) relates to distance d (in parsecs) by d=1/p, so dd = |d&#39;(p)| dp = (1/p^2) dp. Substitute d into the shell volume: dN(p) = 4π (1/p^2)^1 * n * (1/p^2) dp = 4πn (1/p^4) dp. Thus the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales as 1/p^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3CHB:
For uniform spatial density, the cumulative number of stars within distance R is N(&lt;R) ∝ R^3. Since parallax plx ∝ 1/R, we have R ∝ 1/plx so N(&gt;plx) ∝ (1/plx)^3 = plx^{-3}. The number per unit parallax interval is the derivative n(plx) = |dN/dplx| ∝ plx^{-4}.

### thinking by Debate Agent MuYw:
Assume a uniform density of stars in space: number in shell between r and r+dr is ∝r^2dr. Parallax p=1/r ⇒ r=1/p ⇒ dr=−dp/p^2 ⇒ |dr|=dp/p^2. Thus number per interval dp ∝r^2|dr| ∝(1/p^2)*(1/p^2)dp=1/p^4 dp. Hence N(p)∝1/p^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent VbwD:
Assume stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number within distance d is N(&lt;d) ∝ d^3. The parallax p is related to distance by d = 1/p. Thus the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dd ∝ d^2. To convert to number per unit parallax, use dd/dp = –1/p^2. Therefore, dN/dp = (dN/dd)×(dd/dp) ∝ d^2 × (1/p^2) ∝ (1/p^2) × (1/p^2) = 1/p^4. Hence the number of stars per unit parallax goes like ~1/plx^4.

    <pre>For a uniform spatial density, the number of stars in a shell at distance d of thickness dd is ∝ d^2 dd. Since parallax plx p = 1/d, we have d = 1/p and dd = dp/p^2. Substituting gives N per unit parallax ∝ (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) = 1/p^4.
