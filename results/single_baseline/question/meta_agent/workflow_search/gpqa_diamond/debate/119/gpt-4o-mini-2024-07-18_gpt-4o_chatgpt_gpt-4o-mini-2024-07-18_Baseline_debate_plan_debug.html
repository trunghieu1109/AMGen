### thinking by Debate Agent m7NU:
The number density of stars in a volume of space is constant if they are uniformly distributed. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. The volume of space, V, at a distance d is proportional to d^3. Therefore, the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/d^3. Since plx = 1/d, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^3.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3CHB:
To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, we consider that stars are distributed uniformly in space. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a shell of thickness dr at a distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2dr. Since d = 1/plx, we have r = 1/plx and dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Substituting these into the volume expression gives the number of stars proportional to 4π(1/plx)^2 (-1/plx^2) d(plx), which simplifies to ~1/plx^4 d(plx). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to ~1/plx^4.

### thinking by Debate Agent MuYw:
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is related to the volume of space at a given distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance (d = 1/plx), so the volume of space at a distance d is proportional to d^3. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax should be proportional to the volume of space at that distance, which is d^3. Since d = 1/plx, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to (1/plx)^3, or 1/plx^3.

### thinking by Debate Agent VbwD:
If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the density of stars per unit volume is constant. The number of stars within a shell of radius r (where r is the distance to the stars) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2dr. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. Therefore, r = 1/plx. The thickness of the shell in terms of parallax is dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Substituting r = 1/plx into the volume expression, we get the number of stars proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx) = 1/plx^4 d(plx). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~ 1/plx^4.

    <pre>The problem involves understanding how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax when stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a shell at distance d is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd^2dr. In terms of parallax, d = 1/plx, and the thickness of the shell in terms of parallax is dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Substituting these into the volume expression gives the number of stars proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx) = 1/plx^4 d(plx). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. This matches the reasoning of Debate Agents 3CHB and VbwD, who both concluded that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as ~ 1/plx^4.
