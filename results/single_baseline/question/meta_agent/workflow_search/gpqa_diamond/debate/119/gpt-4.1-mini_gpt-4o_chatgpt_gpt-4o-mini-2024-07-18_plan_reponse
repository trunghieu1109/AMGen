        "response": "The number of stars per unit volume is constant due to the uniform distribution of stars. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., plx = 1/d. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness delta d is proportional to d^2 * delta d. Converting this to parallax, the volume is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * delta(1/plx), which simplifies to 1/plx^4 * delta plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. This reasoning aligns with the answers given by agents m7NU and MuYw.\n\nAnswer:D)",
