Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The molecule has three sp3 stereocenters (C5 with OH, C6 with Cl, and C2 with methyl, noting C9 is not chiral because its two substituents are identical –CH2–CH3 segments) and two nonterminal C=C double bonds (at C3=C4 and C7=C8) each with E/Z possibilities. That’s 5 stereogenic elements in total, giving 2^5 = 32 stereoisomers. Thus the correct choice is C).

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 2
