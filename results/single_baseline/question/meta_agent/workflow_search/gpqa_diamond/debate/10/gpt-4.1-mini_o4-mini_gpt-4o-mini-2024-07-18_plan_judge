Question: Example(question='All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n', choice1='Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.', choice2='SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ', choice3='SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n', choice4='The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Statement 1 correctly describes the −1 frameshift mechanism and its conservation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Statement 3 accurately notes ORF3a–induced caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic pathway without altering Bcl-2. Statement 4 is supported by optical tweezers studies showing both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots adopt two conformations under tension, correlating with frameshift efficiency. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14 ExoN’s role—this exonuclease removes mismatches rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown—so it is incorrect.
