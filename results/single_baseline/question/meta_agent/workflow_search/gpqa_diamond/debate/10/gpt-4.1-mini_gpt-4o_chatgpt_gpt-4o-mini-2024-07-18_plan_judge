Question: Example(question='All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n', choice1='Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.', choice2='SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ', choice3='SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n', choice4='The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the incorrect statement, I need to evaluate each option based on known molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. Choice 1 discusses programmed ribosomal frameshifting, which is a known mechanism in coronaviruses and is similar between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Choice 2 involves the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, which is involved in proofreading, but the statement about preventing dsRNA breakdown seems inaccurate. Choice 3 describes ORF3a's role in apoptosis via caspase-8, which aligns with known mechanisms. Choice 4 mentions a linear correlation between frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations, which is not a universally accepted concept. The majority of agents identified Choice 4 as incorrect due to the lack of evidence supporting a linear correlation, while one agent pointed out an inaccuracy in Choice 2. Considering the majority and the reasoning, Choice 4 is the most likely incorrect statement.
