            "All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) are correct except\n\n\n",
            "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ",
            "SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n",
            "The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ",

        "response": "To determine the incorrect statement, we need to evaluate each choice based on the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. Choice 1 describes programmed ribosomal frameshifting, which is a known mechanism in coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and is similar to SARS-CoV. Choice 2 discusses the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, which is involved in RNA proofreading, but the statement about preventing dsRNA breakdown is not accurate as it does not operate in a mismatch repair mechanism like DNA repair. Choice 3 describes the role of ORF3a in apoptosis, which aligns with known functions of viral proteins affecting apoptotic pathways. Choice 4 discusses frameshifting rates and pseudoknot conformations, which is consistent with studies on frameshifting in coronaviruses, but the statement that the rate is linearly correlated with the number of conformations is not typically described as a linear relationship in scientific literature. Both choices 2 and 4 have been identified as potentially incorrect by different agents. However, the majority of agents identified choice 2 as incorrect due to the inaccurate description of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex's function. Therefore, the final answer is choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
