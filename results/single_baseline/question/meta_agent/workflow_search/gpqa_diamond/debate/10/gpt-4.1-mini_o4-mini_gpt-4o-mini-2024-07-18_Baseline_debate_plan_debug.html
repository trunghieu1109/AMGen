    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. &#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. &#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent g2Xu:
Statement 1 is correct: SARS-CoV-2 uses -1 frameshifting with a pseudoknot similar to SARS-CoV. Statement 3 is correct: ORF3a activates caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) without altering Bcl-2. Statement 4 is correct: frameshifting efficiency correlates with pseudoknot conformational heterogeneity, and both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 signals show two conformations under tension. Statement 2 is incorrect: nsp14’s ExoN is an exonuclease that excises mismatched nucleotides (proofreading) and can degrade dsRNA, not prevent its breakdown.

### thinking by Debate Agent Cubc:
We examine each statement:

1) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting at a −1 site near the 5′ end produces pp1a and pp1ab; SARS-CoV-2’s pseudoknot closely resembles SARS-CoV’s. This is correct.

2) nsp14’s N-terminal ExoN proofreads RNA by forming an active exonuclease with nsp10. However, this exonuclease degrades mismatches/dsRNA rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown, so the phrase “prevents the breakdown of dsRNA” is incorrect.

3) ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation (extrinsic pathway) without altering Bcl-2, consistent with known data about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a–induced apoptosis.

4) Frameshifting efficiency correlates with pseudoknot conformational heterogeneity; SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots each show two force-dependent conformers, matching the observed frameshifting rates.

Thus the incorrect statement is choice 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent wmGl:
Statement 1 correctly describes the −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism and its similarity to SARS-CoV. Statement 3 correctly attributes ORF3a–mediated apoptosis to the extrinsic pathway via caspase-8 without altering Bcl-2. Statement 4 is supported by single-molecule studies showing conformational heterogeneity of the pseudoknot correlates with frameshift efficiency in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14 ExoN’s role: it does not prevent dsRNA breakdown but instead excises misincorporated nucleotides from dsRNA during proofreading. Thus, statement 2 is incorrect.

### thinking by Debate Agent mPTt:
We need to identify the false statement among the four. 1) The -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift at the 5′ end via slippery sequence and pseudoknot is conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 – true. 2) nsp14’s ExoN activity requires nsp10 as cofactor to form a proofreading exonuclease complex – true. 3) ORF3a activates caspase-8 without altering Bcl-2, indicating extrinsic apoptosis – supported by studies – true. 4) The claim that the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 each adopt two conformations under tension and that frameshifting efficiency is linearly correlated with the number of conformers is incorrect; SARS-CoV pseudoknots actually show more conformational heterogeneity. Thus the false statement is choice D.

    <pre>Statement 1 correctly describes the −1 frameshift mechanism and its conservation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Statement 3 accurately notes ORF3a–induced caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic pathway without altering Bcl-2. Statement 4 is supported by optical tweezers studies showing both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots adopt two conformations under tension, correlating with frameshift efficiency. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14 ExoN’s role—this exonuclease removes mismatches rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown—so it is incorrect.
