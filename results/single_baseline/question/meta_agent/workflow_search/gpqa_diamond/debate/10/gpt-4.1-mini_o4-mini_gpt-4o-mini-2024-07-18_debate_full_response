'}\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent g2Xu:\nStatement 1 is correct: SARS-CoV-2 uses -1 frameshifting with a pseudoknot similar to SARS-CoV. Statement 3 is correct: ORF3a activates caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) without altering Bcl-2. Statement 4 is correct: frameshifting efficiency correlates with pseudoknot conformational heterogeneity, and both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 signals show two conformations under tension. Statement 2 is incorrect: nsp14’s ExoN is an exonuclease that excises mismatched nucleotides (proofreading) and can degrade dsRNA, not prevent its breakdown.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Cubc:\nWe examine each statement:\n\n1) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting at a −1 site near the 5′ end produces pp1a and pp1ab; SARS-CoV-2’s pseudoknot closely resembles SARS-CoV’s. This is correct.\n\n2) nsp14’s N-terminal ExoN proofreads RNA by forming an active exonuclease with nsp10. However, this exonuclease degrades mismatches/dsRNA rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown, so the phrase “prevents the breakdown of dsRNA” is incorrect.\n\n3) ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation (extrinsic pathway) without altering Bcl-2, consistent with known data about SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a–induced apoptosis.\n\n4) Frameshifting efficiency correlates with pseudoknot conformational heterogeneity; SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots each show two force-dependent conformers, matching the observed frameshifting rates.\n\nThus the incorrect statement is choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent wmGl:\nStatement 1 correctly describes the −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism and its similarity to SARS-CoV. Statement 3 correctly attributes ORF3a–mediated apoptosis to the extrinsic pathway via caspase-8 without altering Bcl-2. Statement 4 is supported by single-molecule studies showing conformational heterogeneity of the pseudoknot correlates with frameshift efficiency in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Statement 2 mischaracterizes nsp14 ExoN’s role: it does not prevent dsRNA breakdown but instead excises misincorporated nucleotides from dsRNA during proofreading. Thus, statement 2 is incorrect.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mPTt:\nWe need to identify the false statement among the four. 1) The -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift at the 5′ end via slippery sequence and pseudoknot is conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 – true. 2) nsp14’s ExoN activity requires nsp10 as cofactor to form a proofreading exonuclease complex – true. 3) ORF3a activates caspase-8 without altering Bcl-2, indicating extrinsic apoptosis – supported by studies – true. 4) The claim that the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 each adopt two conformations under tension and that frameshifting efficiency is linearly correlated with the number of conformers is incorrect; SARS-CoV pseudoknots actually show more conformational heterogeneity. Thus the false statement is choice D.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent g2Xu:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Cubc:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent wmGl:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mPTt:\nD\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
