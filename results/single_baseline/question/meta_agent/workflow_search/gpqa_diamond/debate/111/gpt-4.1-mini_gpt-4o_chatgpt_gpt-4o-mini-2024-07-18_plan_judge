Question: Example(question='Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>, where |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. ', choice1='0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice2='0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice3='0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)', choice4='0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. First, normalize this state: the normalization factor is sqrt((1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)) = sqrt(1+1 + 4+1) = sqrt(7). So, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>. The operator A has off-diagonal elements hbar/2 and diagonal elements 0, which corresponds to a spin operator in the x-direction. The eigenstates of this operator are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Project |alpha> onto these eigenstates: P(+) = |<+|alpha>|^2 = |(3/sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)|^2 = 3/7, and P(-) = |<-|alpha>|^2 = |(-1/sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/7. The average value of the operator is <alpha|A|alpha> = (3/7)(hbar/2) + (1/7)(-hbar/2) = hbar/7. The probabilities are 3/7 and 1/7, and the average value is hbar/7. This matches choice A).
