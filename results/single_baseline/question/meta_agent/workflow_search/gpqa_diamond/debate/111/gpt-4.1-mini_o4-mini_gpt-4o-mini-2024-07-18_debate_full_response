First compute normalization: |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7, so |α> = (1/√7)[(1+i)|↑> + (2−i)|↓>]. The operator A has matrix (0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0), i.e. ħ/2·σ_x. Its eigenstates are |+> = (|↑>+|↓>)/√2 with eigenvalue +ħ/2, and |−> = (|↑>−|↓>)/√2 with eigenvalue −ħ/2. Compute amplitudes:\n<+|α> = 1/√2·1/√7[(1+i) + (2−i)] = 3/√14 ⇒ p+ = 9/14 ≈ 0.643. \n<−|α> = 1/√2·1/√7[(1+i) − (2−i)] = (−1+2i)/√14 ⇒ p− = 5/14 ≈ 0.357. \nAverage ⟨A⟩ = p+(ħ/2) + p−(−ħ/2) = (p+ − p−)(ħ/2) = (4/14)(ħ/2) = ħ/7.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent lO94:\nFirst, normalize the state |α> ∝ (1+i)|↑> + (2−i)|↓>. Its norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7, so |ψ> = ((1+i)|↑> + (2−i)|↓>)/√7. The operator A has matrix A = (ħ/2)σ_x, whose eigenstates are |+>_x = (|↑>+|↓>)/√2 (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and |−>_x = (|↑>−|↓>)/√2 (eigenvalue −ħ/2).\nCompute amplitudes:\n⟨+|ψ> = [1/√2((1+i)+(2−i))]/√7 = 3/√14 ⇒ P(+) = 9/14 ≃ 0.643.\n⟨−|ψ> = [1/√2((1+i)−(2−i))]/√7 = (−1+2i)/√14 ⇒ P(−) = 5/14 ≃ 0.357.\nExpectation value = P(+)·(ħ/2) + P(−)·(−ħ/2) = (9/14 − 5/14)·ħ/2 = (4/14)·ħ/2 = ħ/7.\nThese match choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent BArB:\nThe operator A has matrix (0 hbar/2; hbar/2 0)=(hbar/2)σx.

Compute projections: a_+=<+|α>=(c_up+c_down)/√2√7=(3/√14), so P+=9/14≈0.643; a_-=(c_up−c_down)/√2√7=(−1+2i)/√14, so P-=5/14≈0.357.
