Question: Example(question='By considering different factors like heat, acidic and basic medium, etc., select a suitable mechanism and point out the major products from the following reactions.\n1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A\n(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B', choice1='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice2='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', choice3='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice4='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For reaction A, deprotonation by KH triggers an anionic oxy‐Cope rearrangement of the spiro‐alcohol to give the (E)‐bicyclo[5.3.1]undec‐1(11)‐en‐4‐one. For reaction B, LDA in the presence of acetyl bromide and no acid workup leads to an Ireland–Claisen rearrangement and isolation of the carboxylate as its lithium salt, lithium 3‐ethylpent‐4‐enoate. This matches choice2.
