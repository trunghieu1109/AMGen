Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The threshold condition for γγ→e⁺e⁻ in a head-on collision is E_γ·ε = (m_e c²)². With m_e c² = 511 keV = 5.11×10^5 eV and ε = 10⁻³ eV, we get E_γ = (5.11×10^5 eV)² / 10⁻³ eV ≈2.61×10^14 eV = 2.61×10^5 GeV, which corresponds to choice 3.
