            "The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.",

With m_e c\u00b2 = 511 keV = 5.11\u00d710^5 eV and \u03b5 = 10\u207b\u00b3 eV, we get E_\u03b3 = (5.11\u00d710^5 eV)\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u00b3 eV \u22482.61\u00d710^14 eV = 2.61\u00d710^5 GeV, which corresponds to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
