Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the energy threshold for gamma rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons, we need to consider the minimum energy required for the process gamma gamma -> e+ e-. The threshold energy is approximately 1.022 MeV, which is the combined rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. However, since we are dealing with CMB photons with an average energy of 10^-3 eV, we need to calculate the effective threshold energy for gamma rays. The calculations suggest that the required energy for gamma rays to interact with CMB photons significantly exceeds the threshold energy of 1.022 MeV, leading to estimates in the range of hundreds of GeV. Among the provided options, the choice that aligns with the calculated threshold energy for significant interaction with CMB photons is 2.6*1e5 GeV, which corresponds to choice C. This is supported by the reasoning that higher energy gamma rays are more likely to interact with the low-energy CMB photons, thus limiting their lifetimes in the universe.
