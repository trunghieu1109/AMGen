            "The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.",

        "response": "All agents have calculated the threshold energy for the gamma-ray photon that can annihilate with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. They used the energy threshold condition E_gamma * E_CMB >= (2 * m_e * c^2)^2, where E_CMB is the average energy of a CMB photon (10^-3 eV), and m_e is the electron mass (0.511 MeV). The calculations consistently show that the energy of the gamma-ray should be approximately 2.6 * 10^5 GeV. Therefore, the correct choice is C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
