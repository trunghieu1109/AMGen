Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the threshold energy for the process \( \gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \) is determined by the condition \( E_{\gamma} E_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2 \), where \( m_e c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the electron. Given \( E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \text{ eV} \) and \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV} \), the energy of the gamma-ray photon \( E_{\gamma} \) is calculated to be approximately \( 2.6 \times 10^5 \text{ GeV} \). This matches choice C).
