            "The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.",

        "response": "All agents agree that the threshold energy for the process \\( \\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \\) is determined by the condition \\( E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2 \\), where \\( m_e c^2 \\) is the rest mass energy of the electron. Given \\( E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV} \\) and \\( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} \\), the energy of the gamma-ray photon \\( E_{\\gamma} \\) is calculated to be approximately \\( 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} \\). This matches choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
