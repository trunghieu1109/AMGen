Here mₑc² ≃ 511\u2009keV = 5.11×10⁵\u2009eV, so (mₑc²)² ≃ (5.11×10⁵\u2009eV)² ≃ 2.61×10¹¹\u2009eV². Dividing by ε gives Eγ ≥ 2.61×10¹¹\u2009eV² / 10⁻³\u2009eV = 2.61×10¹⁴\u2009eV = 2.61×10⁵\u2009GeV. This matches choice 2.6×10⁵\u2009GeV (choice 3), which corresponds to C).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Ge1Q:\nThe reaction γγ → e+e− has threshold when the center-of-mass energy squared s ≥ 4m_e^2c^4. For two photons of energies Eγ and ε colliding head-on, s = 2Eγ ε (1 – cosθ) = 4Eγ ε. Setting 4Eγ ε = 4m_e^2c^4 gives Eγ = (m_ec^2)^2/ε. Using m_ec^2 = 0.511 MeV = 5.11×10^5 eV and ε ≃10^−3 eV yields Eγ ≃(5.11×10^5 eV)^2/(10^−3 eV) ≃2.61×10^14 eV ≃2.6×10^5 GeV. This corresponds to choice 3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent UPac:\nTo find the threshold gamma-ray energy E for pair production with a CMB photon of energy ε≈10⁻³\u2009eV, use s=4Eε≥4m_e²c⁴ ⇒ E_th=(m_e c²)²/ε. With m_e c²≈0.511\u2009MeV=5.11×10⁵\u2009eV, (5.11×10⁵)²≈2.61×10¹¹\u2009eV²; dividing by ε=10⁻³\u2009eV gives E_th≈2.61×10¹⁴\u2009eV=2.61×10⁵\u2009GeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent M92R:\nWe need the threshold energy of a high-energy photon E_γ interacting with a CMB photon of energy ε so that γγ→e⁺e⁻. The threshold condition for head-on collision is E_γ·ε = m_e²c⁴. Given m_e c²=511\u2009keV, so m_e²c⁴=(511\u2009keV)²=2.61×10¹¹\u2009eV². With ε≈10⁻³\u2009eV, the threshold E_γ≈2.61×10¹¹\u2009eV²/10⁻³\u2009eV=2.61×10¹⁴\u2009eV=2.61×10⁵\u2009GeV.
