Question: Example(question='A chemist performed two reactions by taking two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. Select the proper starting material for both of the reactions.\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one', choice1='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice2='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice3='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice4='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The stereocenter at C-3 of the starting acid remains unchanged during reduction and cyclization, so to obtain the (R)-lactone in reaction A the starting acid must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and to obtain the (S)-lactone in reaction B the starting acid must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to choice 4.
