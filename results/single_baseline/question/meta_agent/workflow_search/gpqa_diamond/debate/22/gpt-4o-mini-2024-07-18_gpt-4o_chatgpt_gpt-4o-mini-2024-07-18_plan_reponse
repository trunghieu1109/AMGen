            "In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?",

        "response": "The reaction of ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide involves the addition of HBr to the alkene, likely following Markovnikov's rule. This would result in the formation of bromoalkoxybenzene derivatives. The presence of two new spots on the TLC suggests the formation of two regioisomers, which are consistent with the addition of bromine to different positions on the alkene. The most plausible structures for the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, as these represent the two possible regioisomers formed by the addition of HBr to the alkene.\n\nAnswer:B",
