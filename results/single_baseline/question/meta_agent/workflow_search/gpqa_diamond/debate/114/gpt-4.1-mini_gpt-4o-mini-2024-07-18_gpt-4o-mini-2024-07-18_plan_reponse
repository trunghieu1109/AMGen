            "An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?",

        "response": "To determine the angle between the two photons produced from the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we consider the conservation of momentum and energy. The photons are emitted in opposite vertical directions (one upper-right and one lower-right), which suggests they are symmetrically emitted. The angle between the two photons can be calculated based on their trajectories. Since they are emitted at equal energies and in opposite vertical directions, the angle between them can be inferred to be 180 degrees minus the angle formed by their vertical components. Given the options provided, the angle that fits the scenario described is 138 degrees, as this reflects the angular separation considering both photons are emitted in opposite vertical directions. Therefore, the final answer is 138 degrees.\n\nAnswer:C",
