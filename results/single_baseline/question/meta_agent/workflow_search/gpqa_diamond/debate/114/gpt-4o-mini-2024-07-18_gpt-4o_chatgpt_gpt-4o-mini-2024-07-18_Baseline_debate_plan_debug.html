### thinking by Debate Agent BF3H:
We start by recognizing that the electron and positron are both moving at relativistic speeds, so relativistic momentum and energy conservation principles must be applied. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( c \) is the speed of light. 

For the electron with \( \gamma = 4 \), the velocity \( v_e \) can be calculated using the Lorentz factor equation. Similarly, for the positron with \( \gamma = 2 \), we find its velocity \( v_p \). The total energy of each particle is given by \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( m \) is the rest mass of the electron or positron. 

In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero before the collision, and it must remain zero after the collision. Therefore, the two photons must have equal and opposite momentum components along the vertical direction to maintain zero total momentum. 

The angle between the two photons can be determined by considering the need for the vertical components of their momenta to cancel each other out, given that they have equal energy and hence equal magnitude of momentum. The angle between the directions of the photons is therefore 180 degrees minus twice the angle each makes with the horizontal axis. Solving for this angle using trigonometric identities gives us the result.

### thinking by Debate Agent ix0F:
First, we need to calculate the velocities of the electron and positron using their Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For the electron, \( \gamma = 4 \), so \( v_e = c \sqrt{1 - 1/16} = c \sqrt{15/16} \). For the positron, \( \gamma = 2 \), so \( v_p = c \sqrt{1 - 1/4} = c \sqrt{3/4} \). In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. After annihilation, the photons are emitted such that their momentum vectors cancel out. The photons are moving symmetrically with respect to the original direction of motion (horizontal axis). Since the photons are emitted in the upper-right and lower-right directions, they form an angle \( \theta \) with the horizontal axis. The angle between the directions of the photons is twice this angle \( 2\theta \). Using the conservation of momentum and symmetry, the angle \( \theta \) can be derived using trigonometric identities, leading to the calculation of \( 2\theta \).

### thinking by Debate Agent fFc2:
To solve the problem, we first need to determine the momentum and energy of the electron and positron before the collision. The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for both particles, which allows us to calculate their velocities and energies. The Lorentz factor for the electron is 4, which implies its velocity is v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16). For the positron, the Lorentz factor is 2, so its velocity is v = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4). The total energy of each particle is E = gamma * m * c^2, where m is the rest mass of the electron/positron and c is the speed of light. The momentum of each particle is p = gamma * m * v. Since the problem states that the photons have the same energy and are emitted symmetrically, the total momentum before and after the collision must be conserved. The photons are moving in opposite vertical directions with equal and opposite vertical components of momentum, and the horizontal components must add up to the initial total momentum. Using the conservation of momentum and energy, we can find the angle between the two photon directions. The angle between the directions of the photons can be found using trigonometric relationships, considering the symmetry and the fact that the photons have equal energy and opposite vertical components. After calculation, the angle between the directions of the photons is found to be 138 degrees.

First, we need to determine the velocities of the electron and positron using their Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \). For the electron, \( \gamma = 4 \), so \( v_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}}c = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \). For the positron, \( \gamma = 2 \), so \( v_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}}c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \). 

Upon annihilation, the total momentum of the system must be conserved. The electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, so their rest masses are equal. The momentum of the electron is \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e \) and for the positron \( p_p = \gamma_p m_p v_p \). 

The total momentum before collision is \( p_{total} = p_e - p_p \). 

After annihilation, the two photons will have equal energy and momentum, and their momentum vectors must add up to the total momentum before collision. Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, they must have equal momentum magnitudes and make equal angles with the horizontal axis. 

The angle between the directions of the photons can be found using the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the problem. The angle between the two photon directions is twice the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. 

Using the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the problem, the angle between the photon directions is 96 degrees.
