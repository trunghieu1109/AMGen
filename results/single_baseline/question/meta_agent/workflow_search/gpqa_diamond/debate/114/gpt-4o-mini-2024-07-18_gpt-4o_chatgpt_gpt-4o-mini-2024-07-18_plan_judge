Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves the annihilation of an electron and a positron, both moving at relativistic speeds, resulting in the emission of two photons. The key to solving this problem is the conservation of momentum and energy. The Lorentz factors given allow us to calculate the velocities of the electron and positron. In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero before the collision, and it must remain zero after the collision. The photons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the original direction of motion, and they have equal energy. The angle between the directions of the photons is determined by the need for their vertical momentum components to cancel each other out, while their horizontal components add up to the initial total momentum. The symmetry and conservation laws lead to the conclusion that the angle between the directions of the photons is 138 degrees.
