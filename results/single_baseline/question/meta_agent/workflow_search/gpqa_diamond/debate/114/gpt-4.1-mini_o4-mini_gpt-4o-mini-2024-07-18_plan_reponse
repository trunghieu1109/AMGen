            "An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?",

        "response": "The total lab energy is E = (\u03b31 + \u03b32) m c^2 = 6 m c^2. The total momentum is p = (\u221a(\u03b31^2 - 1) - \u221a(\u03b32^2 - 1)) m c = (\u221a15 - \u221a3) m c. After annihilation into two photons of equal energy E\u03b3 = 3 m c^2, their momentum magnitude is p\u03b3 = 3 m c. Conservation of x\u2013momentum gives 2 p\u03b3 cos\u03b8 = p \u21d2 cos\u03b8 = (\u221a15 - \u221a3)/6 \u2248 0.3568 \u21d2 \u03b8 \u2248 69.1\u00b0. The angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248 138.2\u00b0, matching choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
