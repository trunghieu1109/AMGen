Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The total lab energy is E = (γ1 + γ2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2. The total momentum is p = (√(γ1^2 - 1) - √(γ2^2 - 1)) m c = (√15 - √3) m c. After annihilation into two photons of equal energy Eγ = 3 m c^2, their momentum magnitude is pγ = 3 m c. Conservation of x–momentum gives 2 pγ cosθ = p ⇒ cosθ = (√15 - √3)/6 ≈ 0.3568 ⇒ θ ≈ 69.1°. The angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.2°, matching choice 3.
