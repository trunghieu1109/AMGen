Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the angle between the directions of the photons is determined by the conservation of momentum and energy. The symmetry of the problem, with one photon moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, suggests that the angle between them is twice the angle each makes with the horizontal axis. The calculations and reasoning provided by each agent consistently lead to the conclusion that the angle between the directions of the photons is 96 degrees.
