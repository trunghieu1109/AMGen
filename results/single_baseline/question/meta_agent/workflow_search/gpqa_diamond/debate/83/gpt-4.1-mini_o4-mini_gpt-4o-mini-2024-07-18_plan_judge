Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Parallelization of the matrix exponential via fractional approximation hinges on expressing the rational approximation in partial fraction form. This decomposition yields independent shifted linear solves (resolvent terms) that can be computed concurrently, enabling conversion of the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.
