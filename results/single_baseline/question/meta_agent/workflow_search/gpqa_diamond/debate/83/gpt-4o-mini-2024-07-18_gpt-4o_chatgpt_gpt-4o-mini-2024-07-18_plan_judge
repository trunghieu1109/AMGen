Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, particularly in the context of approximating the matrix exponential function using fractional approximations, is the ability to decompose the problem into independent subproblems. The linear partial fraction of fractional approximation allows for such decomposition, enabling parallel computation by breaking down the matrix exponential into simpler components that can be computed independently. This is a common method in numerical analysis to facilitate parallelism. Therefore, the correct choice is related to the linear partial fraction decomposition.
