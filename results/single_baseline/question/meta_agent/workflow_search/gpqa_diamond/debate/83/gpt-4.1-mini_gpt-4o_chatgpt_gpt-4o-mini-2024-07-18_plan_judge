Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, in the context of approximating the matrix exponential function using fractional approximation, is the linear partial fraction decomposition. This decomposition allows the problem to be broken down into independent tasks that can be executed in parallel, which is essential for parallel computing. The consistent reasoning across all agents supports the conclusion that the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation is the crucial factor for enabling parallelism.
