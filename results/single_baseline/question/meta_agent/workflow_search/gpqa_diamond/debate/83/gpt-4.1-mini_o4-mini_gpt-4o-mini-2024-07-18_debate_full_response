A fractional approximation using partial fractions writes the exponential as a sum of terms like w_j(A + z_jI)^{-1}. Each of these inverse solves is independent and can be computed in parallel. Thus the critical enabler is the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent kBJ8:\nTo approximate the matrix exponential in a way that allows independent computation of terms (and thus parallel execution), one uses a rational approximation and then applies partial fraction decomposition. This breaks the approximation into a sum of terms of the form wi(I – σiA)–1, each of which can be solved independently and in parallel. Neither nonlocal boundary conditions nor stability analysis nor the mere existence of complex roots by itself enables this decomposition into parallel tasks; it is the linear partial fraction form that is key.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent J1MF:\nTo parallelize the computation of the matrix exponential via a fractional approximation, one performs a partial fraction decomposition of the rational approximation. This splits the problem into independent shifted linear solves, which can be executed concurrently. Thus the key factor enabling conversion from a sequential algorithm to a parallel algorithm is the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ywsn:\nThe parallel splitting relies on expressing the matrix exponential approximation in a partial fraction form, which decomposes it into independent resolvent terms.
