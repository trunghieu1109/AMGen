The conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm involves breaking down tasks that can be executed simultaneously. This is typically facilitated by the structure of the approximation method used. The linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation allows the problem to be split into smaller, independent parts that can be processed in parallel. This is because each term in the partial fraction can be treated separately, enabling parallel computation. Therefore, the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm is the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent kBJ8:\nTo convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, we need to consider the nature of the problem and the mathematical techniques involved. In this case, the problem involves approximating the matrix exponential function using fractional approximation. The key factor for parallelism often involves decomposing the problem into independent tasks that can be executed concurrently. The linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation is a technique that allows breaking down a complex problem into simpler parts, which can then be solved in parallel. This decomposition is crucial for parallel computing as it enables the distribution of independent computations across multiple processors.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent J1MF:\nTo convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, the focus is generally on breaking down the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously. In the context of approximating the matrix exponential function, the fractional approximation method involves dividing the task into smaller, manageable components. The key factor in achieving parallelism here is the ability to separate computations in a way that they can be executed concurrently without dependency issues. Linear partial fraction decomposition allows the matrix exponential to be expressed as a sum of simpler terms, which can be computed independently. This decomposition is crucial for parallelizing the computation, as it enables the distribution of tasks across multiple processors.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ywsn:\nTo convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, it is crucial to identify components that can be executed independently.
