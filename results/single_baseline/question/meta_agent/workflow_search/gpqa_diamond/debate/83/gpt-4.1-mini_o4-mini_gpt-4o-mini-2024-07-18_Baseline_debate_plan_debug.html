    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation.

### thinking by Debate Agent R9L8:
To parallelize the algorithm for solving the heat equation via matrix exponential approximation, one needs to express the exponential in a form that decomposes nicely into independent tasks. A fractional approximation using partial fractions writes the exponential as a sum of terms like w_j(A + z_jI)^{-1}. Each of these inverse solves is independent and can be computed in parallel. Thus the critical enabler is the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation.

### thinking by Debate Agent kBJ8:
To approximate the matrix exponential in a way that allows independent computation of terms (and thus parallel execution), one uses a rational approximation and then applies partial fraction decomposition. This breaks the approximation into a sum of terms of the form wi(I – σiA)–1, each of which can be solved independently and in parallel. Neither nonlocal boundary conditions nor stability analysis nor the mere existence of complex roots by itself enables this decomposition into parallel tasks; it is the linear partial fraction form that is key.

### thinking by Debate Agent J1MF:
To parallelize the computation of the matrix exponential via a fractional approximation, one performs a partial fraction decomposition of the rational approximation. This splits the problem into independent shifted linear solves, which can be executed concurrently. Thus the key factor enabling conversion from a sequential algorithm to a parallel algorithm is the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation.

### thinking by Debate Agent ywsn:
The parallel splitting relies on expressing the matrix exponential approximation in a partial fraction form, which decomposes it into independent resolvent terms. These terms can be computed concurrently, enabling the sequential algorithm to be converted into a parallel one.
