Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Modeling the decay as an exponential (memoryless) process: given P(decay ≤ 100 min) = 0.32 ⇒ e^(−λ·100) = 0.68 ⇒ λ = −ln(0.68)/100. The probability of decay in the next 150 min, given survival so far, is 1 − e^(−λ·150) = 1 − (0.68)^(1.5) ≈ 1 − 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393 ≈ 44%.
