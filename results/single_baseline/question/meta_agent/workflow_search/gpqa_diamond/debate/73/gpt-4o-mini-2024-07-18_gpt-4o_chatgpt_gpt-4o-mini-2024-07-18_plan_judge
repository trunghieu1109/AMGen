Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the probability of decay of a radioactive atom given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, which means the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%. The probability of not decaying in 50 minutes is the square root of 68%, approximately 82.44%. For the next 150 minutes, the probability of not decaying is (0.68)^(1.5), which is approximately 0.558. Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - 0.558, which is approximately 44%. This matches the answer given by Debate Agent KWRV and 5mll, which is choice C).
