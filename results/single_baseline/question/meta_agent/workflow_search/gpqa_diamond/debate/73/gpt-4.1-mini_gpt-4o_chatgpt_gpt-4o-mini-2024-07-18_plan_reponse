            "We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ",

        "response": "The problem involves calculating the probability of decay of an atom in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the first 50 minutes. We know the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which means the probability of not decaying within 100 minutes is 68%. To find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, we can use the exponential decay formula. However, given the choices, we can deduce the answer directly. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is closest to 48%.\n\nAnswer:B)",
