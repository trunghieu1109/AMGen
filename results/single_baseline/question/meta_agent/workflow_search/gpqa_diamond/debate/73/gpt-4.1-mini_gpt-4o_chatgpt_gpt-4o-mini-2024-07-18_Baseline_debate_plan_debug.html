    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;52%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;48%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;44%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;40%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent KWRV:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the decay of the atom as a memoryless process, which is characteristic of exponential decay. The probability that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes does not affect the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes. We know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which means the probability of not decaying within 100 minutes is 68%. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the first 50 minutes. We can calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes using the exponential decay formula or by considering the complementary probability. However, given the choices, we can deduce the answer directly: The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is closest to 48%.

We know that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. This means the probability of the atom not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%. Given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, we need to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since decay is a memoryless process, we can use the exponential decay law. The probability of decay in 150 minutes is given by 1 minus the probability of survival in 150 minutes. The probability of survival in 150 minutes can be calculated using the decay constant derived from the initial 100-minute probability. First, calculate the decay constant \( \lambda \) using the formula \( 1 - e^{-\lambda \times 100} = 0.32 \). Then, use this \( \lambda \) to find the probability of survival in 150 minutes. Finally, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 minus this survival probability.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5mll:
To solve this, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. We know that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. The probability that the atom does not decay in 100 minutes is 68% (1 - 0.32). Since 50 minutes have passed without decay, we have a new scenario where we need to consider the remaining 150 minutes. We are interested in the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Since decay processes are memoryless (exponential decay), the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start. We can use the formula for exponential decay to determine this. If P(t) is the probability of decay by time t, P(150) = 1 - (1 - P(100))^(150/100). Calculate P(150) with P(100) = 0.32.

### thinking by Debate Agent OLFK:
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the memoryless property of exponential decay. The probability of decay in the next 100 minutes is given as 32%. This implies that the decay follows an exponential distribution. Since the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the fact that it has already survived 50 minutes. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes using the decay rate (lambda) derived from the initial 100-minute probability. We first calculate the decay rate (lambda) from the given 100-minute probability, then use it to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes.
