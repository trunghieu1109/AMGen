    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;52%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;48%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;44%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;40%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent KWRV:
We assume radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution with constant rate λ.  Given P(decay within 100 min)=0.32, we have e^{–λ·100}=0.68 ⇒ λ=–(1/100)·ln(0.68).  We want P(decay between t=50 and t=200 | survive to t=50).  For an exponential, this equals 1 – e^{–λ·(200–50)} = 1 – e^{–λ·150}.  Since e^{–λ·100}=0.68, e^{–λ·150} = (e^{–λ·100})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5} ≈0.5607.  Thus the conditional probability ≈1–0.5607=0.4393≈44%.

### thinking by Debate Agent aGvm:
We assume the decay follows an exponential distribution: P(decay ≤ t)=1−e^(−λt). Given P(decay ≤100)=0.32, so e^(−100λ)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−(ln 0.68)/100. The probability it decays between t=50 and t=200, given it survived 50, is 1−e^(−λ·150) =1−(e^(−100λ))^1.5 =1−0.68^1.5 ≈1−0.5607=0.4393≈44%.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5mll:
We have a single atom with exponential decay. The probability of decay within time t is P(t)=1−e^{−λt}. Given P(100 min)=0.32 → e^{−λ·100}=0.68 → λ=−ln(0.68)/100. We want the probability it decays in the next 150 min given survival to 50 min. For exponential decay, memorylessness implies P(decay in [50,200] | survive to 50)=1−e^{−λ(200−50)}=1−e^{−λ·150}. Compute λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.0038566. Then λ·150≈0.5785, so probability=1−e^{−0.5785}≈1−0.5606≈0.4394≈44%.

### thinking by Debate Agent OLFK:
We assume the decay follows an exponential distribution (memoryless). Given P(decay in 100 min)=0.32 ⇒ e^(−λ·100)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100. By memorylessness, P(decay in next 150 min|survived so far)=1−e^(−λ·150)=1−(e^(−λ·100))^1.5=1−0.68^1.5≈1−0.5607≈0.4393≈44%.

    <pre>Modeling the decay as an exponential (memoryless) process: given P(decay ≤ 100 min) = 0.32 ⇒ e^(−λ·100) = 0.68 ⇒ λ = −ln(0.68)/100. The probability of decay in the next 150 min, given survival so far, is 1 − e^(−λ·150) = 1 − (0.68)^(1.5) ≈ 1 − 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393 ≈ 44%.
