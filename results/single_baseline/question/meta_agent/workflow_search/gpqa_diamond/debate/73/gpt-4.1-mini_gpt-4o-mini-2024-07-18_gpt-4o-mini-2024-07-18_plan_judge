Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes after having survived 50 minutes, we first note that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, which means the survival probability is 68%. Since the decay process is memoryless, we can treat the next 150 minutes as a new scenario. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes can be calculated based on the survival probability for that time frame. After analyzing the calculations and considering the choices provided, the most consistent answer across the reasoning is 48%.
