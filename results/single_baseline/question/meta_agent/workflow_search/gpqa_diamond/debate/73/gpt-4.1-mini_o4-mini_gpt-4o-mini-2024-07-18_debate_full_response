Given P(decay within 100 min)=0.32, we have e^{–λ·100}=0.68 ⇒ λ=–(1/100)·ln(0.68).  We want P(decay between t=50 and t=200 | survive to t=50).  For an exponential, this equals 1 – e^{–λ·(200–50)} = 1 – e^{–λ·150}.  Since e^{–λ·100}=0.68, e^{–λ·150} = (e^{–λ·100})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5} ≈0.5607.  Thus the conditional probability ≈1–0.5607=0.4393≈44%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent aGvm:\nWe assume the decay follows an exponential distribution: P(decay ≤ t)=1−e^(−λt). Given P(decay ≤100)=0.32, so e^(−100λ)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−(ln\u20090.68)/100. The probability it decays between t=50 and t=200, given it survived 50, is 1−e^(−λ·150) =1−(e^(−100λ))^1.5 =1−0.68^1.5 ≈1−0.5607=0.4393≈44%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5mll:\nWe have a single atom with exponential decay. The probability of decay within time t is P(t)=1−e^{−λt}. Given P(100 min)=0.32 → e^{−λ·100}=0.68 → λ=−ln(0.68)/100. We want the probability it decays in the next 150 min given survival to 50 min. For exponential decay, memorylessness implies P(decay in [50,200] | survive to 50)=1−e^{−λ(200−50)}=1−e^{−λ·150}. Compute λ=−ln(0.68)/100≈0.0038566. Then λ·150≈0.5785, so probability=1−e^{−0.5785}≈1−0.5606≈0.4394≈44%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent OLFK:\nWe assume the decay follows an exponential distribution (memoryless). Given P(decay in 100\u2009min)=0.32 ⇒ e^(−λ·100)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100. By memorylessness, P(decay in next 150\u2009min|survived so far)=1−e^(−λ·150)=1−(e^(−λ·100))^1.5=1−0.68^1.5≈1−0.5607≈0.4393≈44%.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KWRV:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent aGvm:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5mll:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent OLFK:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
