You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

This UGA (TGA in DNA) causes premature termination, so the ribosome stops early and the full protein is not produced.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Fzu4:\nThe HA tag sequence YPYDVPDYA should start after the start codon. Translating the provided sequence: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA … gives M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-Stop. The AAA codon for Lys is followed immediately by TGA, a stop codon. Thus translation terminates prematurely after the tag, preventing overexpression of the full GADD45G fusion protein.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5MSv:\nI translated the provided DNA sequence in the given frame and found that after the HA‐tag coding region (ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACT…) there is an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately following the tag. This premature stop prevents translation of the downstream GADD45G coding sequence, so the ribosome terminates early.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent i8Or:\nFirst, I translated the 5′ sequence in frame and noticed that immediately after the HA epitope and a few downstream codons, there is a TGA stop codon (positions 31–33). This would cause premature termination of translation, preventing the overexpression of the full-length protein. The other choices (linker issues, missense mutation in the tag, missing tRNA) do not explain the immediate stop codon. Therefore, the correct answer is that the ribosome terminated translation early.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3bO5:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Fzu4:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5MSv:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent i8Or:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
