Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by LipofectamineÂ®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The task is to determine why the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The sequence provided is a DNA sequence, and the start of the sequence 'ATG' is the start codon for translation. The task mentions that the sequence should include an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag, which is typically a specific sequence of amino acids used for tagging proteins. The HA tag sequence is YPYDVPDYA, and the first part of the sequence 'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTAC' translates to 'MYPYDVPDY', indicating that the HA tag is correctly positioned at the N-terminus without any missense mutations. Therefore, choice 3 is incorrect. The other options include a lack of a linker sequence, early termination by the ribosome, or issues with the tRNA for UAA. The sequence does not contain an early stop codon, so choice 2 is unlikely. The mention of tRNA for UAA is irrelevant because UAA is a stop codon, not a tRNA issue. The most plausible reason is that the ribosome terminated the translation early due to a stop codon, which aligns with choice 2. Therefore, the final answer is choice 2.
