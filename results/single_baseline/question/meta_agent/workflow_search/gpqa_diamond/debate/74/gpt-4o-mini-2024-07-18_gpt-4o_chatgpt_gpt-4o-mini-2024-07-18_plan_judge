Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by LipofectamineÂ®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The task is to determine why the protein is not being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. The sequence provided is the plus strand of the construct, and we need to check for any issues that could prevent proper expression. The sequence starts with 'ATG', which is a start codon, and we need to look for any premature stop codons that could cause early termination of translation. Scanning the sequence, we find 'TGA' at position 183-185, which is a stop codon. This would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein and preventing overexpression of the full-length protein. The other options, such as a lack of a linker causing proteolysis, a missense mutation in the antigenic determinant, or a tRNA issue for the UAA codon, do not directly address this issue. Therefore, the most plausible reason is that the ribosome terminated the translation early due to the presence of a stop codon.
