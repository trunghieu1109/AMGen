            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "The reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid lead to the formation of different products, specifically two distinct stereoisomers from each reaction. This results in a total of four distinct products. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, these products may coalesce into fewer peaks due to their similar retention times, likely resulting in 2 or 3 peaks. However, in a chiral HPLC, all stereoisomers can be resolved, leading to 4 distinct peaks. The consensus from the analysis indicates that the chemist will observe 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC, making the most logical choice B) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:B",
