A trans (E) alkene gives the enantiomeric (threo) diol pair (R,R and S,S, racemic), whereas a cis (Z) alkene gives the meso (erythro) diol (R,S). On an achiral (standard) column, enantiomers coelute, so you see one peak for the racemate plus one for the meso diol: 2 peaks. On a chiral column, the racemate separates into two peaks, while the meso diol remains a single peak: 3 peaks.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 8lOb:\nThe peracid epoxidation is syn, giving a cis‐ or trans‐epoxide that upon aqueous acid opens by anti attack to give anti‐diols. Anti addition to an E‐alkene (opposite substituents) yields a pair of enantiomers (R,S and S,R), while anti addition to a Z‐alkene (same‐side substituents) gives the meso diol. Thus Reaction 1 yields a racemic pair, Reaction 2 yields one meso diol. On an achiral (standard) HPLC the enantiomers coelute (1 peak) plus a separate meso peak → 2 peaks. On a chiral column the enantiomers are resolved into 2 peaks, and the meso remains 1 peak → 3 peaks.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jFLp:\nOct-4-ene is symmetric. Epoxidation of (E)-alkene gives the meso epoxide (achiral), while epoxidation of (Z)-alkene gives a racemic epoxide (pair of enantiomers). Acid-catalyzed opening proceeds with anti diol formation, preserving the meso vs racemic pattern: Reaction 1 yields only the achiral meso diol; Reaction 2 yields both enantiomers of the diol. Combined, there are three stereoisomers: the meso diol and a racemic pair. On an achiral column, the two enantiomers coelute, giving one peak for the racemate plus one for meso (2 peaks). On a chiral column, the enantiomers separate, yielding three peaks.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent T38g:\nWe need to determine the stereochemistry of the epoxides produced from (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene upon syn epoxidation.\n\nNumbering oct-4-ene: CH3–CH2–CH2–CH=CH–CH2–CH2–CH3. At each alkene carbon (C4 and C5) the substituents are H and a propyl group.\n\nEpoxidation is a concerted syn addition. If the two propyl groups on the alkene are trans (E‐alkene), they end up trans across the epoxide ring: that geometry has a mirror plane in the ring plane (propyls on opposite faces, hydrogens on the same face), so it is an achiral meso epoxide (one product).\n\nIf they are cis (Z‐alkene), they end up cis on the epoxide: both propyls on the same face and both hydrogens on the opposite face. This geometry is chiral (no mirror plane), so epoxidation gives a racemic pair (two enantiomers).\n\nThus reaction 1 yields 1 achiral meso epoxide; reaction 2 yields 2 enantiomers. Combined, there are 3 distinct stereoisomers.\n\nOn a standard (achiral) HPLC column the two enantiomers coelute as one peak, giving:\n– meso epoxide peak \n– racemate peak\n=> 2 peaks.\n\nOn a chiral HPLC column the racemic pair separates into two enantiomer peaks, plus the meso peak, giving 3 peaks.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent AjL2:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 8lOb:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent jFLp:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent T38g:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
