            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "Epoxidation is syn. (E)-alkene yields an achiral meso epoxide (and thus meso diol), (Z)-alkene yields a racemic pair. Combined products: one meso and two enantiomers. On achiral HPLC the enantiomers coelute (2 peaks total), on chiral HPLC they separate (3 peaks total).\n\nAnswer:C)",
