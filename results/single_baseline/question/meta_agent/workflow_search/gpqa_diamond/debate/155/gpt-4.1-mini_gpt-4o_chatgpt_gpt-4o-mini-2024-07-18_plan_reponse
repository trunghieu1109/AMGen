            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "The reactions involve epoxidation followed by hydrolysis to form diols. Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene forms a meso diol, which is achiral. Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a pair of enantiomeric diols. On a standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso diol and the enantiomeric pair will appear as two peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomers are separated, resulting in three peaks: one for the meso diol and two for the enantiomers.\n\nAnswer:C)",
