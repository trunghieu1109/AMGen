        "response": "The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 (~32%), indicating one chlorine atom. The IR spectrum has a broad 3500\u20132700 cm\u207b\u00b9 band and a sharp 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The \u00b9H NMR exhibits a 1H singlet at 11.0 ppm (COOH) and two 2H doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, indicating an AA\u2032BB\u2032 pattern of a para-disubstituted benzene. Together these data identify the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nAnswer:A)",
