### thinking by Debate Agent 1ZiI:
The IR data shows bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, indicating the presence of N-H stretching, which suggests an amine or amide group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2 group, 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) suggests NH2 protons, 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) suggests a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or group, 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest aromatic protons. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits these data with the ester group (CH3-CH2-O), aromatic ring, and NH2 group.

### thinking by Debate Agent a1IU:
The IR spectrum shows bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, indicating the presence of N-H stretches, which are characteristic of amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals at 1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H), indicating an ethyl group. The signals at 7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) suggest aromatic protons, likely a para-substituted benzene ring. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be due to an NH2 group. Combining this information, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which matches the IR and NMR data.

### thinking by Debate Agent EQ5I:
The IR spectrum shows bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, indicating the presence of N-H bonds, which are typical for amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide carbonyl. In the 1H NMR, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm are characteristic of an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-). The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could indicate an NH2 group. The doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm suggest aromatic protons, likely on a para-substituted benzene ring. Comparing these observations with the given choices: 
- Choice 1 (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide) has an amide group but does not have an ester.
- Choice 2 (4-aminophenyl propionate) has an NH2 group but does not match the ethyl ester signals.
- Choice 3 (3-ethoxybenzamide) has an amide group but does not match the aromatic proton pattern.
- Choice 4 (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has an ester group and an NH2 group, matching the IR and NMR data well.
Therefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

    <pre>All agents analyzed the IR and NMR data, noting the presence of N-H stretches and a carbonyl group, suggesting an amine or amide and an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data indicates an ethyl group and aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm suggests an NH2 group. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate matches these observations with an ester group, NH2 group, and para-substituted benzene ring. Other choices do not fit all the data as well as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate does.
