        "response": "All agents analyzed the IR and NMR data, noting the presence of N-H stretches and a carbonyl group, suggesting an amine or amide and an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data indicates an ethyl group and aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm suggests an NH2 group. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate matches these observations with an ester group, NH2 group, and para-substituted benzene ring. Other choices do not fit all the data as well as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate does.\n\nAnswer:D)",
