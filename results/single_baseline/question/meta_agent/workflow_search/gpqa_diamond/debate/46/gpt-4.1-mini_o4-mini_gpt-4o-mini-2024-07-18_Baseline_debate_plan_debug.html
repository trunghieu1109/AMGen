### thinking by Debate Agent 1ZiI:
The IR shows two medium-to-strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a primary amine (NH₂), and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with an ester C=O. The ¹H NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and a quartet at 4.50 ppm (2H), typical of an ethyl group (–OCH₂CH₃) attached to oxygen. A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) corresponds to an NH₂. The aromatic region shows two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Combining these data gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (an ethoxycarbonyl group para to an NH₂), which is choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent a1IU:
We have C9H11NO2. IR: medium–strong at 3420 and 3325 cm–1 (two N–H stretches), strong at 1720 cm–1 (carbonyl). 1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) indicate an ethoxy group. 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is NH2. Aromatic 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H) show a para-disubstituted ring. Thus we have a para-amino benzoate ester: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

### thinking by Debate Agent EQ5I:
The IR shows two N–H stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a strong C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a primary amine plus an ester (amide C=O appears lower). The ¹H NMR has a triplet (3H) at 1.20 ppm and a quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm – an ethyl ester. The aromatic region shows two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, consistent with a p-disubstituted benzene. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is the NH₂. Thus the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2vga:
We need a compound with formula C9H11NO2 that shows strong IR bands for NH2 (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and an ester carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹). 1H NMR: a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) indicate an ethyl group attached to oxygen (–OCH2CH3). A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is exchangeable NH2. Aromatic signals are two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene. The only choice matching an ethyl ester, a free amino group, and para-substitution is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
