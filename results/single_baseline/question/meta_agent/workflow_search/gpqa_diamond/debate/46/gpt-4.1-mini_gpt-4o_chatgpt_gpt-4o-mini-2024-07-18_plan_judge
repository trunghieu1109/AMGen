Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents analyzed the IR and NMR data to identify the compound. The IR data suggests the presence of NH2 groups and a carbonyl group, likely an ester. The NMR data indicates an ethyl group and a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the choices, 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' matches these characteristics: it has an ethyl group, an NH2 group, a carbonyl group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring. All agents concluded that 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' is the correct compound.
