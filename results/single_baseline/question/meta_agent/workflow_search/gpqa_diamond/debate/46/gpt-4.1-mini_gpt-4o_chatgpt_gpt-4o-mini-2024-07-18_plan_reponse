        "response": "All agents analyzed the IR and NMR data to identify the compound. The IR data suggests the presence of NH2 groups and a carbonyl group, likely an ester. The NMR data indicates an ethyl group and a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the choices, 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' matches these characteristics: it has an ethyl group, an NH2 group, a carbonyl group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring. All agents concluded that 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' is the correct compound.\n\nAnswer:D)",
