Question: Example(question='Identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data.\nIR: medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\nstrong band at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).', choice1='N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide', choice2='4-aminophenyl propionate', choice3='3-ethoxybenzamide', choice4='ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents analyzed the IR and NMR data, noting the presence of N-H stretches and a carbonyl group, suggesting an amine or amide and an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data indicates an ethyl group and aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm suggests an NH2 group. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate matches these observations with an ester group, NH2 group, and para-substituted benzene ring. Other choices do not fit all the data as well as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate does.
