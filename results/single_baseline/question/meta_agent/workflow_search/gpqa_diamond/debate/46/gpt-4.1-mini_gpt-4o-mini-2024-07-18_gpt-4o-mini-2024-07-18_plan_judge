Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To identify the compound C9H11NO2, I analyzed the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, indicating the presence of NH or OH groups, and a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl (C=O) group. The 1H NMR data shows multiple signals: a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), which likely corresponds to a methyl group adjacent to a methylene group; a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), indicating an NH or OH; a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which suggests a methylene group next to an electronegative atom; and aromatic signals at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H), indicating a disubstituted aromatic ring. Analyzing the choices, 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' matches the molecular formula and spectral data, as it contains an ethyl group, an amine, and a carbonyl group, fitting the IR and NMR characteristics.
