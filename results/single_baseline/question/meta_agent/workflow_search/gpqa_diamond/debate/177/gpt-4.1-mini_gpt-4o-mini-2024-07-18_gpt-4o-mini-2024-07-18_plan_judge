proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \kappa in the given Lagrangian, we analyze the dimensions of the components in the interaction term. The fermionic field \psi has a mass dimension of \frac{3}{2}, and the field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has a mass dimension of 2. The term \sigma_{\mu\nu} is dimensionless. Therefore, we can set up the equation for the mass dimensions: \left[\mathcal{L}_{int}\right] = 4\text{ (since the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4)} = \left[\kappa\right] + 2 + \frac{3}{2} + 0. Solving this gives \left[\kappa\right] = 4 - 2 - \frac{3}{2} = -1. This indicates that \kappa has a mass dimension of -1. As for the renormalizability, theories with interactions that have mass dimensions greater than 4 are generally non-renormalizable, while those with mass dimensions equal to or less than 4 can be renormalizable. Here, since \kappa has a dimension of -1, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice is that \left[\kappa\right]_{M} = -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

Answer:The mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.
Extracted answer: The mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.
