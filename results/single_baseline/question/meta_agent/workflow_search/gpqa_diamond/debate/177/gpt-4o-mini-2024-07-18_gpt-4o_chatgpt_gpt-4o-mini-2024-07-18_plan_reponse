        "response": "All agents agree that the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is 4. The Dirac field \\( \\psi \\) has a mass dimension of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), and the field strength tensor \\( F^{\\mu\\nu} \\) has a mass dimension of 2. The gamma matrices are dimensionless. Therefore, the term \\( \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} \\) has a mass dimension of \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\). To make the Lagrangian term have a dimension of 4, \\( \\kappa \\) must have a mass dimension of \\( 4 - 5 = -1 \\). A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have a mass dimension of zero or greater. Since \\( \\kappa \\) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice is C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
