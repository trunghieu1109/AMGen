proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we analyze the interaction term \( \mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \). The Dirac field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \), so \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has mass dimension 3. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. The \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) matrices are dimensionless. Therefore, the term \( \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has a total mass dimension of 5. The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, so \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \( \kappa \) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.
