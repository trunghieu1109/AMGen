So operator dimension =3/2+3/2+2=5. The action integrand must have dimension 4, so [κ]=4−5=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent IIdv:\nThe interaction Lagrangian is L_int = κ \\barψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. In four dimensions the fields have mass dimensions: [ψ]=3/2, [\\barψ]=3/2, [F_{μν}]=2, and σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the operator \\barψσψF has dimension 3/2+3/2+2=5. Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, we need [κ]+5=4 ⇒ [κ]=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension corresponds to a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent AEtP:\nIn 4D, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, and F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus the operator ψ̄σψF has dimension 3 + 2 = 5, so κ must carry dimension 4 − 5 = −1. A coupling with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent XhAP:\nThe mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ψ has dimension 3. The field strength F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus the interaction operator ψ̄σ_{μν}ψ F^{μν} has dimension 5. Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4−5=−1. A coupling of negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KGqg:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent IIdv:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent AEtP:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent XhAP:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
