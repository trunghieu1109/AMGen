### thinking by Debate Agent KGqg:
We have interaction Lint=κ ψ̄σμνψFμν. Mass dimensions: [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2, σμν is dimensionless. So operator dimension =3/2+3/2+2=5. The action integrand must have dimension 4, so [κ]=4−5=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.

### thinking by Debate Agent IIdv:
The interaction Lagrangian is L_int = κ \barψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. In four dimensions the fields have mass dimensions: [ψ]=3/2, [\barψ]=3/2, [F_{μν}]=2, and σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the operator \barψσψF has dimension 3/2+3/2+2=5. Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, we need [κ]+5=4 ⇒ [κ]=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension corresponds to a nonrenormalizable interaction.

### thinking by Debate Agent AEtP:
In 4D, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, and F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus the operator ψ̄σψF has dimension 3 + 2 = 5, so κ must carry dimension 4 − 5 = −1. A coupling with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.

### thinking by Debate Agent XhAP:
The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ψ has dimension 3. The field strength F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus the interaction operator ψ̄σ_{μν}ψ F^{μν} has dimension 5. Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4−5=−1. A coupling of negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.
