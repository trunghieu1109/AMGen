Question: Example(question='Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2×2 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue, φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c∙S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? ', choice1='The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.', choice2='The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.', choice3='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1. ', choice4='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π. ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The matrix S is similar to the Pauli matrix σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay = c∙S are ±(h/4π). The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not necessarily of Az, unless they commute. Choice 1 is consistent with the properties of angular momentum operators, while choice 2 is a general statement about eigenfunctions being basis functions. Choices 3 and 4 incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having imaginary parts, which they do not. Therefore, choice 1 is the most accurate statement regarding the properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of Ay.
