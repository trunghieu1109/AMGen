A fragment at m/z 45 is characteristic of the CO₂H⁺ ion from carboxylic acids. An unsaturated monocarboxylic acid with formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits these data.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent uCdO:\nThe broad IR absorption at 3000 cm–1 indicates an O–H (acid) stretch. Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm–1 point to a carbonyl (C=O) and C=C (alkene). 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (alkene). A fragment at m/z 45 is consistent with the acylium ion (CH3–C≡O+), typical for carboxylic acids. Among the given formulas only C6H10O2 can be an unsaturated carboxylic acid (one C=O, one C=C, one OH) matching all data.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Zn5N:\nThe very broad FTIR peak at ∼3000 cm⁻¹ indicates an O–H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid (which also exhibits broad OH). The strong carbonyl absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ supports a C=O. The additional 1650 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a C=C double bond. The ¹H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (C=C–H), confirming unsaturation. The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to the CO₂H⁺ fragment typical of carboxylic acids. Combining these data: an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons fits C₆H₁₀O₂. Thus the correct choice is A).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Hm2A:\nThe broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates an O–H stretch (likely a carboxylic acid), the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a C=O stretch, and the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates C=C. ¹H NMR vinyl signals confirm an alkene, and the m/z 45 fragment corresponds to the COOH⁺ fragment. A monocarboxylic acid with one C=C and no extra oxygens fits C6H10O2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent XscY:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent uCdO:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Zn5N:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Hm2A:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
