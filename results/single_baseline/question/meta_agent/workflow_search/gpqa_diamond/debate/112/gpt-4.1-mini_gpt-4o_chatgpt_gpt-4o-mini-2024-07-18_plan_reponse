            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.",

        "response": "All agents agree that the FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an OH group and a carbonyl group, with peaks at 3000, 1700, and 1650 wavenumbers. The 1H NMR spectrum shows vinyl hydrogens, indicating C=C bonds. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 suggests a fragment like CH3CO+, which is consistent with a carbonyl group. The presence of both an OH group and a carbonyl group, along with the unsaturation indicated by the vinyl hydrogens, suggests a compound with both C=C and C=O groups, likely a carboxylic acid or ester. The formula C6H10O2 fits these observations, as it accounts for the unsaturation and the presence of both OH and C=O groups.\n\nAnswer:A)",
