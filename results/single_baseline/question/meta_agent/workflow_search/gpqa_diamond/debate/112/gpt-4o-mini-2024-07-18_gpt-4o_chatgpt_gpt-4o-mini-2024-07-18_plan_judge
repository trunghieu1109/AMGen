Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm^-1) and a carbonyl group (peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1), suggesting a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows vinyl hydrogens, indicating C=C double bonds. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH3CO, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. The compound is likely to have both a carbonyl group and a double bond, and possibly an alcohol or carboxylic acid group. Among the given choices, C6H10O2 fits the data as it can have a carbonyl, a double bond, and an O-H group, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Most agents agree on C6H10O2, and it fits all the spectroscopic data.
