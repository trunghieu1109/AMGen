            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.",

        "response": "The IR spectrum shows a broad OH stretch (~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a strong C=O stretch (1700 cm\u207b\u00b9) along with a C=C stretch (1650 cm\u207b\u00b9). \u00b9H NMR peaks for vinyl hydrogens confirm an alkene. The mass fragment at m/z 45 is characteristic of a CO\u2082H\u207a fragment from a carboxylic acid. An unsaturated monocarboxylic acid with six carbons fits the formula C6H10O2.\n\nAnswer:A)",
