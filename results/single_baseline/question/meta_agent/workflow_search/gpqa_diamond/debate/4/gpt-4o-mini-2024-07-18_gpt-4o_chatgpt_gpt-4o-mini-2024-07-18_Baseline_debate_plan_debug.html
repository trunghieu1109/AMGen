To solve this problem, we need to consider the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, such as a muon. The operators given (P_x, P_y, P_z) correspond to the Pauli matrices multiplied by \(\hbar/2\). The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) of a spin operator along a direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane can be found by considering the rotation of the spin vector. The direction \(\vec{n}\) is parameterized by angles \(\theta\) and \(\phi\), but since \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, \(\phi = 0\). The eigenvector is then given by the spinor: \((\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))\).

To solve this problem, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The operator P can be expressed as a linear combination of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The direction vector n in the x-z plane can be parameterized as n = (sin(θ), 0, cos(θ)). The operator P along n is given by P_n = n · P = sin(θ)P_x + cos(θ)P_z. Substituting the given matrices for P_x and P_z, we get P_n = (ħ/2)(sin(θ)σ_x + cos(θ)σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices corresponding to P_x and P_z, respectively. The eigenvalue equation for P_n is P_n |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2)|ψ⟩. Solving this equation, we find that the eigenvector |ψ⟩ has the form (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\hbar/2, we need to construct the operator \vec{P} = P_x \hat{i} + P_y \hat{j} + P_z \hat{k} along the direction \vec{n} in the x-z plane. The components of \vec{P} are given as matrices, so the operator in the direction \vec{n} can be represented as a linear combination of these matrices. The direction vector \vec{n} in the x-z plane can be written as (\sin(\theta), 0, \cos(\theta)). Hence, the operator \vec{P} in this direction is \vec{P}_n = \sin(\theta) P_x + \cos(\theta) P_z. Solving the eigenvalue equation \vec{P}_n |\psi&gt; = +\hbar/2 |\psi&gt; with the given matrices, we find the eigenvector. After normalization, the eigenvector corresponds to a spin-1/2 system, which is typically expressed in terms of angles \theta and \phi. The correct expression for a normalized eigenvector in this context is (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)).

### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:
To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2, we need to solve the eigenvalue equation for the operator P. The operator P is given by the linear combination P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. The components of P are given as matrices: P_x = ℏ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], P_y = ℏ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and P_z = ℏ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. Substituting n_y = 0, we find P = ℏ/2 * (n_x * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]). The eigenvalue equation is P * v = (ℏ/2) * v, where v is the eigenvector. Solving this equation involves finding the vector v that satisfies this equation, which typically involves considering the spin-1/2 system and the rotation of the spinor. The normalized eigenvector for a spin-1/2 particle in a direction specified by angles θ and φ is given by (cos(θ/2), e^(iφ)sin(θ/2)).

    <pre>The problem involves finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator for a spin-1/2 particle, such as a muon, along a direction in the x-z plane. The operator components are given as matrices corresponding to the Pauli matrices. The direction vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized as (sin(θ), 0, cos(θ)). The operator along this direction is a linear combination of the given matrices for P_x and P_z. The eigenvalue equation for this operator is solved to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvector is typically expressed in terms of angles θ and φ. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ = 0, and the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). This matches choice C.
