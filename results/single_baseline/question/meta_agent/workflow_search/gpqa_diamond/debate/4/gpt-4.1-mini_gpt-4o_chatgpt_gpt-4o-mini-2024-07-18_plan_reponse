            "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n",

        "response": "The problem involves finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator \\( \\vec{P} \\) along a direction \\( \\vec{n} \\) in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue \\( +\\hbar/2 \\). The components of \\( \\vec{P} \\) are given as Pauli matrices scaled by \\( \\hbar/2 \\). The direction \\( \\vec{n} \\) can be expressed as \\( (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta) \\). The operator \\( P_n \\) is then \\( \\hbar/2 (\\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z) \\). Solving the eigenvalue equation for this operator, the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\( +\\hbar/2 \\) is known to be \\( (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2)) \\), which matches choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
