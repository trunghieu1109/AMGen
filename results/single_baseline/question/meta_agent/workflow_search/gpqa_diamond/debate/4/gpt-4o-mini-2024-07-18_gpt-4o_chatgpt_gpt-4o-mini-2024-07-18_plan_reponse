            "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n",

        "response": "The problem involves finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator for a spin-1/2 particle, such as a muon, along a direction in the x-z plane. The operator components are given as matrices corresponding to the Pauli matrices. The direction vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized as (sin(\u03b8), 0, cos(\u03b8)). The operator along this direction is a linear combination of the given matrices for P_x and P_z. The eigenvalue equation for this operator is solved to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvector is typically expressed in terms of angles \u03b8 and \u03c6. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 = 0, and the eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). This matches choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
