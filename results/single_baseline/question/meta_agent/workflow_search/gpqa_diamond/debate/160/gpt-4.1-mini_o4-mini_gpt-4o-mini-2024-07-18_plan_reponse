            "While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be \u03bb1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to \u03bb1; rather, it was \u03bb2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about \u03bb2 based on the aforementioned scenario?",

        "response": "The molecular mean free path \u03bb1 is based on gas molecule\u2013molecule collisions, which include a relative\u2010velocity factor \u221a2 in the collision cross section. For high\u2010energy electrons (1000\u2009kV) scattering off gas molecules, the electron\u2013molecule scattering cross section is much smaller than the molecule\u2013molecule cross section, so electrons travel farther between collisions. This increases the mean free path over the molecular value by at least the \u221a2 factor (~1.414), which exceeds the 22% threshold. Therefore \u03bb2 \u2265 1.22\u00b7\u03bb1.\n\nAnswer:D",
