Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined by the properties of the gas molecules in the vacuum, such as pressure and temperature. When the electron beam is introduced, the mean free path λ2 is determined by the scattering of electrons with the gas molecules. Electrons, being much smaller and faster, generally have a longer mean free path compared to gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 is expected to be greater than λ1. The choice that reflects this understanding is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1, indicating that electron scattering results in a longer mean free path compared to gas molecule collisions.
