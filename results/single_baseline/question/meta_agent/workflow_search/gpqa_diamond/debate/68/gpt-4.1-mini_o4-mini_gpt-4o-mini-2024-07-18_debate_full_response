The dilated lifetime is τ=γτ₀≈7.92·8×10⁻¹⁶\u2009s=6.34×10⁻¹⁵\u2009s, so the mean decay length is L=cτ≈3×10⁸\u2009m/s·6.34×10⁻¹⁵\u2009s≈1.9×10⁻⁶\u2009m.  To see at least 30% of decays in a distance x, we need 1–e^(–x/L)≥0.30 ⇒ x≥–L·ln\u20090.70≈0.36·L≈0.7×10⁻⁶\u2009m.  The only available choice on the micrometer scale is 2.08×10⁻⁶\u2009m.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 78UB:\nWe need to find the lab‐frame decay length L such that 30% of decays occur within L: P=1−exp(−L/(γβcτ₀))=0.3 → L=−γβcτ₀·ln(0.7).\nGiven τ₀=8×10⁻¹⁶\u2009s, c=3×10⁸\u2009m/s → cτ₀=2.4×10⁻⁷\u2009m. Energy E=27\u2009GeV, mass m=3.41\u2009GeV → γ=E/m≈7.92, β=√(1−1/γ²)≈0.992, γβ≈7.86.\nThus L=7.86·2.4×10⁻⁷\u2009m·(−ln\u20090.7)≈7.86·2.4×10⁻⁷·0.3567≈6.7×10⁻⁷\u2009m. This is on the order of 10⁻⁶\u2009m. The closest choice is 2.08×10⁻⁶\u2009m.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent rzvy:\nWe need the length scale over which at least 30% of X0 decays happen in the lab frame.  The lab‐frame mean decay length is λ = γβcτ0.  With E = 27\u2009GeV and m = 3.41\u2009GeV, γ = E/m ≃ 7.92, β ≃ 0.99, cτ0 = (3×10^8\u2009m/s)(8×10^−16\u2009s) ≃ 2.4×10^−7\u2009m.  Thus λ ≃ γβ\u2009cτ0 ≃7.92×2.4×10^−7\u2009m ≃1.9×10^−6\u2009m ≃2.08×10^−6\u2009m.  To see 30% of decays we need a resolution on the order of this mean decay length (the smallest choice of order 10^−6\u2009m).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent T3jp:\nCompute gamma = E/m = 27\u2009GeV/3.41\u2009GeV ≈ 7.92. Lab‐frame lifetime τ = γτ₀ ≈ 7.92·8×10⁻¹⁶\u2009s ≈ 6.33×10⁻¹⁵\u2009s. Mean decay length L₀ = cτ ≈ 3×10⁸\u2009m/s·6.33×10⁻¹⁵\u2009s ≈ 1.9×10⁻⁶\u2009m. To observe ~30% decays need resolution on order of L₀ (or somewhat smaller), i.e. ~10⁻⁶\u2009m.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent faZf:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 78UB:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent rzvy:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent T3jp:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
