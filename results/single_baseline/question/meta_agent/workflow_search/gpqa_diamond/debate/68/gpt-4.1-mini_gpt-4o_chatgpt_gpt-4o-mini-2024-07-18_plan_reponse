        "response": "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the decay length in the lab frame. The proper lifetime of X^0 is given as \\( \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\) s. The energy of X^0 is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is \\( E/m = 27/3.41 \\). The decay length \\( L \\) in the lab frame is given by \\( L = \\gamma c \\tau_0 \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light. To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need the resolution to cover a distance such that \\( 1 - e^{-x/L} = 0.3 \\). Solving for \\( x \\) gives \\( x = -L \\ln(0.7) \\). After calculating \\( L \\) and \\( x \\), we compare the result with the choices given. The correct choice is D) 2.08*1e-3 m.\n\nAnswer:D)",
