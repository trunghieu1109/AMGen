Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Compute the Lorentz factor: γ = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≃ 7.92. Lab‐frame lifetime τ = γ τ₀ = 7.92 × 8×10⁻¹⁶ s ≃ 6.34×10⁻¹⁵ s. Mean decay length L = c τ ≃ 3×10⁸ m/s × 6.34×10⁻¹⁵ s ≃ 1.9×10⁻⁶ m. To observe at least 30% of decays within distance x: 1 – exp(–x/L) = 0.3 ⇒ x ≃ –L ln 0.7 ≃ 0.36 L ≃ 0.7×10⁻⁶ m. The closest available resolution is 2.08×10⁻⁶ m.
