The proper lifetime of X^0 is given as \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} s. The energy of X^0 is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. First, we find the velocity of X^0 using the relation between energy, mass, and velocity in relativistic terms. The Lorentz factor \\gamma is E/m = 27/3.41. The decay length L in the lab frame is given by L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0, where \\beta is the velocity of the particle in units of c. We find \\beta from \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}. After calculating \\gamma and \\beta, we substitute into the decay length formula. To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to find the distance where 30% of X^0 particles decay. This is given by the exponential decay law N(x) = N_0 exp(-x/L), where N(x)/N_0 = 0.3. Solving for x gives us the minimum resolution needed.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 78UB:\nTo determine the minimum resolution needed, we first need to calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame. Given the proper lifetime \\( \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\) s and the energy \\( E = 27 \\) GeV, we can find the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\). Then, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is \\( \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 \\). The distance traveled by the particle in this time is \\( d = c \\tau \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light. To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need the resolution to cover a distance such that \\( 1 - e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.3 \\), where \\( \\lambda = c \\tau \\) is the decay length. Solving for \\( d \\) gives the minimum resolution needed.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent rzvy:\nTo find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the decay length L that corresponds to 30% decay probability. First, we calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) using the energy and mass of X^0: gamma = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Then, the decay length is L = c * tau_0 * gamma. To find the length for 30% decay probability, we use the exponential decay formula: P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/tau). For 30% decay, P(t) = 0.3, so t = -tau * ln(0.7). The resolution is then L = c * gamma * t. After calculating, we compare the result with the choices given.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent T3jp:\nTo determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we use the concept of decay length in the frame of the detector. The decay length L is given by L = \\gamma c \\tau_0, where \\gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and \\tau_0 is the proper lifetime. The Lorentz factor \\gamma is given by \\gamma = E/m, where E is the energy and m is the mass of the particle. Here, E = 27 GeV and m = 3.41 GeV, so \\gamma = 27/3.41. The speed of light c is approximately 3 \\times 10^8 m/s, and \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} s. Thus, L = (27/3.41) \\times (3 \\times 10^8) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16}) meters. To observe 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the distance corresponding to 30% of the exponential decay, which is approximately 0.3L. Calculating this gives the minimum resolution needed.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent faZf:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 78UB:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent rzvy:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent T3jp:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
