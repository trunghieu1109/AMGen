Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the decay length in the lab frame. The proper lifetime of X^0 is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \) s. The energy of X^0 is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is \( E/m = 27/3.41 \). The decay length \( L \) in the lab frame is given by \( L = \gamma c \tau_0 \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need the resolution to cover a distance such that \( 1 - e^{-x/L} = 0.3 \). Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = -L \ln(0.7) \). After calculating \( L \) and \( x \), we compare the result with the choices given. The correct choice is D) 2.08*1e-3 m.
