        "response": "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^{0}, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the particle during its proper lifetime. The energy of the particle is given as 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. We can use the relativistic relation to find the momentum and then the speed of the particle. The distance traveled during the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 = 8 \u00d7 10^{-16} s can be calculated using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time. After performing the calculations, we find that the minimum resolution required to observe the decays must be less than or equal to the distance traveled by the particle during its lifetime. The calculations indicate that the correct minimum resolution is 2.08*1e-6 m, which corresponds to the choice that aligns with the majority of the reasoning provided.\n\nAnswer:C",
