    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent gCuk:
To determine the roles and interactions of the genes G1, G2, and G3, we analyze the resistance levels in the mutants. The g1 mutant retains 75% resistance, suggesting G1 contributes partially to resistance. The g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, indicating G2 is crucial for resistance, possibly as a transcription factor. The g3 mutant has 50% resistance, meaning G3 also contributes significantly. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, reinforcing the critical role of G2. The g1g3 mutant shows 10% resistance, indicating some redundancy or interaction between G1 and G3. Given that G2 is essential for resistance and the role of G1 and G3 in redundancy or interaction, the most fitting conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent A3AB:
First, analyze the resistance levels of the single mutants. G1 has 75% resistance, G2 has 0%, and G3 has 50%. This suggests that G2 is crucial for resistance, possibly acting as a transcription factor. Next, consider the double mutants: g1g3 has 10% resistance, g2g3 and g1g2 both have 0%. The g1g3 result shows a significant drop in resistance, suggesting G1 and G3 may have overlapping functions (gene redundancy) or that G1 is epistatic to G3. Since g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, G2 is likely upstream of the other genes, reinforcing the idea that G2 is a transcription factor. Among the choices, choice 1 aligns with this analysis: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent RGi4:
First, analyze the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type. The g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, indicating G2 is critical for resistance and likely a transcription factor. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, supporting the idea that G2 is upstream or essential. The g1 mutant has 75% resistance, suggesting G1 contributes to resistance but is not solely responsible. The g3 mutant has 50% resistance, indicating G3 also contributes but is not solely responsible. The g1g3 mutant shows 10% resistance, suggesting some redundancy or interaction between G1 and G3. Since G2 is likely the transcription factor, G1 and G3 could be downstream genes with some pleiotropy or redundancy. G1 being epistatic towards G3 means that G1&#39;s function masks or modifies the effect of G3, which is consistent with the g1g3 result being lower than g1 alone. Thus, the most fitting conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent BWyY:
To solve this, let&#39;s analyze the data: 1) g1 has 75% resistance, indicating G1 contributes to resistance but is not solely responsible. 2) g2 has 0% resistance, suggesting G2 is crucial for resistance, potentially as a transcription factor. 3) g3 has 50% resistance, indicating G3 also contributes partially. 4) g1g3 has 10% resistance, showing G1 and G3 together are more effective than individually, suggesting redundancy. 5) g2g3 and g1g2 both have 0% resistance, reinforcing G2&#39;s critical role. Given G2&#39;s complete loss of resistance when knocked out, it is likely the transcription factor. G1 and G3 show redundancy because their double mutant g1g3 drastically reduces resistance compared to individual knockouts. Finally, G1 is epistatic to G3 because g1g3 has notably lower resistance than g1 alone, indicating G1&#39;s role is upstream or more dominant in the pathway. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that identifies G2 as a transcription factor, G1 and G3 showing redundancy, and G1 being epistatic towards G3.
