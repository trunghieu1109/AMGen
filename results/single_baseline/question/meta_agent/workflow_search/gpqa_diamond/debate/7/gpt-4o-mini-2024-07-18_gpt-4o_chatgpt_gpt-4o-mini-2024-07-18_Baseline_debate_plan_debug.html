    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent gCuk:
To determine the interaction among the genes, we analyze the resistance levels in the mutants. The g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is crucial for resistance and likely a transcription factor. The g1 mutant shows 75% resistance, suggesting G1 contributes but is not critical alone. The g3 mutant shows 50% resistance, indicating G3 also contributes but isn&#39;t critical alone. In double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 show 0% resistance, confirming G2&#39;s pivotal role. The g1g3 mutant shows 10% resistance, indicating redundancy between G1 and G3, but G1 might be more upstream or epistatic. Therefore, G2 is likely the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show some redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent A3AB:
First, analyze the results of the single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance, g2 has 0% resistance, and g3 has 50% resistance. This suggests that G2 is critical for resistance as its knockout results in complete susceptibility. Next, look at the double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, indicating G2&#39;s significant role. The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is lower than either g1 or g3 alone, suggesting some interaction between G1 and G3. The fact that g2 mutants always show 0% resistance indicates that G2 might be a transcription factor. G1 and G3&#39;s interaction suggests they might have overlapping functions (redundancy) but not complete, as g1g3 has a reduced resistance. G1&#39;s higher resistance than g3 suggests G1 could be epistatic to G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent RGi4:
First, analyze the resistance levels of the single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance, g2 has 0% resistance, and g3 has 50% resistance. g2&#39;s complete loss of resistance suggests it may be a transcription factor. Next, consider the double mutants: g1g3 has 10% resistance, g2g3 has 0% resistance, and g1g2 has 0% resistance. The g1g3 mutant indicates that G1 and G3 might have overlapping roles, as their double mutation significantly reduces resistance. G1&#39;s higher resistance in the single mutant and its impact in the double mutant with G3 suggest epistasis over G3. Therefore, G2 is likely a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent BWyY:
To determine the interactions and functions of the genes, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants. G2 knockout results in 0% resistance, indicating G2 is crucial for resistance, likely being a transcription factor. In double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, reinforcing G2&#39;s upstream role. G1 and G3 have reduced resistance individually (75% and 50%, respectively) and show further reduced resistance in the g1g3 double mutant (10%), suggesting they contribute additively to resistance, possibly indicating pleiotropy. G1&#39;s presence in g1g3 increases resistance compared to g2g3, suggesting G1 is epistatic towards G3. Therefore, G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.
