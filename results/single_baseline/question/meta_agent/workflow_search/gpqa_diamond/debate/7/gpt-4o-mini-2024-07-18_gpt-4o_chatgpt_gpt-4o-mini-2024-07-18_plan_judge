Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Analyzing the resistance levels of the mutants, g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating G2 is crucial for resistance and likely a transcription factor. The g1 mutant shows 75% resistance, and the g3 mutant shows 50% resistance, suggesting both contribute to resistance but are not critical alone. The g1g3 double mutant shows 10% resistance, indicating some redundancy between G1 and G3, but G1 might be more upstream or epistatic. The g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants both show 0% resistance, confirming G2's pivotal role. Therefore, G2 is likely the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show some redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.
