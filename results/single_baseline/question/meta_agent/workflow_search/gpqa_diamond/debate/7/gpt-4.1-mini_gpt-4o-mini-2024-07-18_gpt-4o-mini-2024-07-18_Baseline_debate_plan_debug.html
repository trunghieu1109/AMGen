    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent gCuk:
To analyze the results, we notice that g2 has 0% resistance, indicating it is likely a critical gene for resistance, suggesting it could be a transcription factor. The double mutants involving g2 (g2g3 and g1g2) also show 0% resistance, reinforcing the idea that g2 is essential for resistance. G1 and G3 show some level of redundancy since g1 maintains some resistance alone and g3 does as well, but together with g1, they drop to 10% resistance, indicating that G1 may be epistatic towards G3. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent A3AB:
To analyze the results, we note that g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating that it is crucial for resistance and likely acts as a transcription factor. The g1g2 and g2g3 mutants also show 0% resistance, suggesting that G2 is epistatic and that G1 and G3 cannot compensate for its loss. Moreover, g1 shows resistance at 75% and g3 at 50%, indicating that G1 may have a role in redundancy with G3. However, since g1g3 shows only 10% resistance, G1 is likely epistatic over G3. Therefore, the most fitting conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 exhibit redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent RGi4:
To analyze the results of the gene knock-out mutants and their resistance to anthracnose, we need to look at the resistance levels of each mutant and their combinations. The data shows that g2 has a complete loss of resistance (0%), indicating that it likely plays a crucial role in resistance, possibly as a transcription factor. The g1 mutant retains some resistance (75%), while g3 has moderate resistance (50%). The double mutants g1g3 and g1g2 also show drastically reduced resistance, especially g1g2 which is at 0%. This suggests that G2 is essential for resistance and might be a transcription factor. The interaction suggests that G1 and G3 might have some redundancy in their function, but G1 appears to have a more dominant role in relation to G3, indicating a potential epistatic relationship. Therefore, the best conclusion is that G2 is likely the transcription factor, and G1 is epistatic towards G3 because of its higher resistance levels when G3 is present.

### thinking by Debate Agent BWyY:
To analyze the results, we see that g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating that it is likely a crucial gene for resistance. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, confirming that g2 is essential. The g1 mutant shows 75% resistance, suggesting that it is not essential for resistance but may contribute. The g3 mutant shows 50% resistance, indicating it also contributes but is less critical than g2. The g1g3 double mutant shows only 10% resistance, suggesting that g1 and g3 interact negatively when combined. The fact that g1 and g3 together lead to significantly reduced resistance implies that g1 is likely epistatic to g3. Therefore, the most plausible conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor (as it is critical for resistance), and G1 is epistatic towards G3, indicating G1 may regulate or influence the function of G3.
