            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

        "response": "After analyzing the results of the gene knock-out mutants and their resistance to anthracnose, it is clear that g2 has a complete loss of resistance (0%), indicating it is likely a crucial gene for resistance and possibly acts as a transcription factor. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, reinforcing the idea that g2 is essential for resistance. The g1 mutant retains some resistance (75%), while g3 has moderate resistance (50%). The g1g3 double mutant shows only 10% resistance, suggesting that G1 is epistatic towards G3. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nAnswer:A",
