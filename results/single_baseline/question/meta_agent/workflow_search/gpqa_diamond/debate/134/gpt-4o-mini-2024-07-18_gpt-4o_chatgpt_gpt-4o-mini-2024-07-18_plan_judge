proposed answer: To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, we need to consider the mass of the decay products. The decay is allowed if the sum of the masses of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of the boson X. The possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. The top quark (t) is too heavy to be produced, as its mass is about 173 GeV. The bottom quark (b) has a mass of about 4.18 GeV, so it is kinematically allowed. The charm quark (c) has a mass of about 1.27 GeV, and the strange (s), up (u), and down (d) quarks, as well as the tau (τ), muon (μ), and electron (e) leptons, all have masses well below 6 GeV. Therefore, the possible decay channels are into b\bar{b}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, τ^+τ^-, μ^+μ^-, and e^+e^- pairs. The correct choice is B) because it includes b\bar{b} which is kinematically allowed.
