            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

        "response": "To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship T_eq \u221d (1/a^2)^0.25, where 'a' is the semi-major axis. According to Kepler's third law, a \u221d P^(2/3). Given the orbital period ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the semi-major axis ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Therefore, the temperature ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/2). Calculating this gives approximately 0.75. This matches the reasoning of multiple agents and the closest choice is ~0.75.\n\nAnswer:A)",
