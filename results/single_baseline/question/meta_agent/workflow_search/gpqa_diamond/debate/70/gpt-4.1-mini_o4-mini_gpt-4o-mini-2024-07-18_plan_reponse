            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

        "response": "For planets with identical albedo orbiting the same star, equilibrium temperature T_eq \u221d a^(\u20131/2). By Kepler\u2019s third law, a \u221d P^(2/3), so T_eq \u221d P^(\u20131/3). Therefore T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(\u20131/3) = (3.5/2)^(\u20131/3) = (1.75)^(\u20131/3) \u2248 1/1.20 \u2248 0.83.\n\nAnswer:B)",
