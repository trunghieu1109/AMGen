            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

        "response": "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we analyze the orbital periods given in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, which is related to the orbital period. Using the periods, we find that the ratio of the periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2 is 3.5/2. The temperature ratio T4/T2 can be calculated as the square root of the inverse of this ratio, leading to T4/T2 = sqrt(2/3.5). This calculation yields approximately 0.75. However, some analyses suggest a value closer to 0.83. After careful consideration of the calculations and the methods used, the more consistent result across multiple analyses is approximately 0.75. Therefore, the final answer is ~0.75.\n\nAnswer:~0.75",
