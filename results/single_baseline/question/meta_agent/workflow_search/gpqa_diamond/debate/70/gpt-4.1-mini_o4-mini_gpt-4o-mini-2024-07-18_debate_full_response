From Kepler’s third law, a ∝ P^(2/3), so T_eq ∝ P^(–1/3). Thus the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(–1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Here P2=2, P4=3.5, so T4/T2=(2/3.5)^(1/3)≈0.83.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent sY4v:\nWe are given five exoplanets in circular orbits with orbital periods in the ratio P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We assume identical albedos and want the equilibrium temperature ratio T4/T2. For planets in circular orbits around the same star, the equilibrium temperature scales as T ∝ a^(–1/2), where a is the orbital radius. From Kepler’s third law (for the same stellar mass), a ∝ P^(2/3). Combining these gives T ∝ P^(–1/3). Hence,\n\nT4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(–1/3).\n\nSubstitute P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75. Then T4/T2 = (1.75)^(–1/3) = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3). The cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2, so T4/T2 ≈ 1/1.2 ≈ 0.83.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent NxJR:\nEquilibrium temperature T ∝ a^(-1/2) and orbital period P ∝ a^(3/2), so T ∝ P^(-1/3). For Planet_4 and Planet_2: T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) ≈ 1.75^(-1/3) ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent FPU0:\nWe want the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 vs Planet_2. For planets with same albedo orbiting the same star: T_eq ∝ (stellar flux)^(1/4), flux F ∝ 1/a^2. From Kepler’s third law, a ∝ P^(2/3), so F ∝ 1/P^(4/3) and thus T_eq ∝ P^(–1/3). Therefore T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Given P2=2, P4=3.5, ratio= (2/3.5)^(1/3)= (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yDBD:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent sY4v:\nB\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NxJR:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FPU0:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
