    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~0.75&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~0.83&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~0.69&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~0.57&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent yDBD:
To find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq ∝ (1/a^2)^0.25, where &#39;a&#39; is the semi-major axis. The semi-major axis is related to the orbital period by Kepler&#39;s third law: a ∝ P^(2/3). Given the orbital period ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the semi-major axis ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Therefore, the temperature ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/2).

### thinking by Debate Agent sY4v:
To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq ∝ (1/a^2)^0.25, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, the semi-major axis a is proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (Kepler&#39;s third law: T^2 ∝ a^3). The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so the semi-major axes are in the ratio (1)^(2/3):(2)^(2/3):(2.5)^(2/3):(3.5)^(2/3):(5)^(2/3). We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_4/T_2, which is ((a_2/a_4)^2)^0.25 = (a_2/a_4)^0.5. Therefore, T_4/T_2 = ((2/3.5)^(2/3))^0.5. Calculating this gives approximately 0.75.

### thinking by Debate Agent NxJR:
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance. Given the orbital resonance ratios, we can deduce the relative distances of the planets using Kepler&#39;s Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance). Therefore, the distance ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 can be determined from their period ratio, which is 3.5:2. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is then the inverse square root of the distance ratio: (T4/T2) = sqrt(P2/P4) = sqrt(2/3.5). Calculating this gives approximately 0.75.

### thinking by Debate Agent FPU0:
To find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets, we can use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T ∝ (1 / sqrt(a)), where &#39;a&#39; is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the planets are in circular orbits, the semi-major axis is proportional to the orbital period raised to the power of 2/3 (Kepler&#39;s Third Law). Thus, T ∝ (1 / (P^(2/3))).

For Planet_2 and Planet_4, the orbital period ratio is 2:3.5. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature ratio is (3.5^(2/3)) / (2^(2/3)). Calculating this gives:

(3.5^(2/3)) ≈ 2.1544
(2^(2/3)) ≈ 1.5874

So, the temperature ratio T_4/T_2 ≈ 1.5874 / 2.1544 ≈ 0.737.

The closest choice to this result is ~0.75.
