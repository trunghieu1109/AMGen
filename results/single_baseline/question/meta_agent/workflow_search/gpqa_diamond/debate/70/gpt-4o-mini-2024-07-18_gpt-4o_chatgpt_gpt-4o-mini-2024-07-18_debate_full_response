This means T ∝ 1/sqrt(P), where T is the temperature and P is the orbital period. Given the orbital period ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 (P4) and Planet_2 (P2) would be T4/T2 = sqrt(P2/P4). Substituting the values from the ratio, we get T4/T2 = sqrt(2/3.5) = sqrt(0.5714). Calculating this gives approximately 0.7559, which is closest to choice 1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent sY4v:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T ~ (1/d^2)^(1/4), where d is the distance from the star. The distance can be inferred from the orbital period using Kepler's third law: d ~ T^(2/3). Given the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the distances will be in the ratio 1^(2/3):2^(2/3):2.5^(2/3):3.5^(2/3):5^(2/3). We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_4/T_2, which is (d_2/d_4)^(1/2). Calculate d_2 = 2^(2/3) and d_4 = 3.5^(2/3), then find the ratio (d_2/d_4)^(1/2).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent NxJR:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their distances from the star are proportional to the cube root of their orbital periods (Kepler's third law). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is proportional to the inverse square root of the ratio of their orbital periods. Given the orbital period ratio for Planet_4 to Planet_2 is 3.5 to 2, the temperature ratio is proportional to (2/3.5)^(1/2). Calculating this gives (2/3.5)^(1/2) ≈ 0.75.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent FPU0:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature, T_eq, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period ratio. Since the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq4/T_eq2 is (P2/P4)^(1/2). The orbital period ratio for Planet_4 to Planet_2 is 3.5/2. Therefore, the temperature ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/2). Calculating this gives approximately 0.7559, which is closest to 0.75.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yDBD:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent sY4v:\n~0.83\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NxJR:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FPU0:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
