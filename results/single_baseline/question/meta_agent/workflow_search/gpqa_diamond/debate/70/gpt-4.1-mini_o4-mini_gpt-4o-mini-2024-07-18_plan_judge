Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For planets with identical albedo orbiting the same star, equilibrium temperature T_eq ∝ a^(–1/2). By Kepler’s third law, a ∝ P^(2/3), so T_eq ∝ P^(–1/3). Therefore T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(–1/3) = (3.5/2)^(–1/3) = (1.75)^(–1/3) ≈ 1/1.20 ≈ 0.83.
