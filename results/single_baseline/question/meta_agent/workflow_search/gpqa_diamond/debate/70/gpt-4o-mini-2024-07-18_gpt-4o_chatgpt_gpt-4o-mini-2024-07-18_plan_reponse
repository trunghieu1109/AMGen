            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",
            "~0.75",
            "~0.83",
            "~0.69",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital period, assuming constant albedo and stellar luminosity. The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. For Planet_4 and Planet_2, the period ratio is 3.5:2. The temperature ratio T4/T2 is proportional to (P2/P4)^(1/2) = (2/3.5)^(1/2). Calculating this gives approximately 0.7559, which is closest to choice A) ~0.75.\n\nAnswer:A)",
