        "response": "SMEFT is a local, unitary, Lorentz\u2010invariant quantum field theory that must respect full Poincar\u00e9 symmetry (translations + Lorentz) and by the CPT theorem must respect CPT invariance. CP symmetry is not required since the SM already violates CP. Therefore the necessary symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincar\u00e9), and 4 (CPT), which corresponds to choice D.\n\nAnswer:D",
