### thinking by Debate Agent YEBh:
1. SMEFT operators are built in a local quantum field theory respecting Poincare symmetry (which includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations). 2. CP symmetry is not assumed because the SM already contains CP violation and SMEFT allows CP-violating operators. 3. CPT symmetry is guaranteed by any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT. Therefore, the required symmetries are Lorentz/Poincare and CPT, corresponding to choice 4 (1,2,4).

### thinking by Debate Agent xGoY:
The SMEFT is constructed as a local quantum field theory respecting the full Poincaré symmetry (translations + Lorentz transformations) and, by the CPT theorem, must also respect CPT invariance. CP need not be respected since the SM already contains CP violation. Hence the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincaré), and 4 (CPT).

### thinking by Debate Agent xotZ:
The SMEFT must be a relativistic quantum field theory respecting full Poincaré symmetry (which includes Lorentz invariance and translations) and CPT invariance. CP symmetry is not required because the SM itself violates CP. Thus the operators must respect symmetries 1, 2, and 4, corresponding to option 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent 47aU:
The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is built as a local quantum field theory that preserves the fundamental spacetime and CPT symmetries of the underlying Standard Model.  
1) Lorentz symmetry is required as part of relativistic QFT.  
2) Poincaré symmetry (which includes Lorentz transformations plus spacetime translations) must hold for any relativistic field theory.  
3) CP symmetry is not generally preserved—SMEFT may include CP‐violating operators just like the SM itself.  
4) CPT symmetry follows from locality, unitarity, and Lorentz invariance and must be respected.  
Therefore the allowed symmetries are 1,2,4, corresponding to choice4.
