Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: SMEFT is a local, unitary, Lorentz‐invariant quantum field theory that must respect full Poincaré symmetry (translations + Lorentz) and by the CPT theorem must respect CPT invariance. CP symmetry is not required since the SM already violates CP. Therefore the necessary symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincaré), and 4 (CPT), which corresponds to choice D.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 4
