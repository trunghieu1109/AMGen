        "response": "All agents agree that the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in the SMEFT due to known CP violation in the Standard Model. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries, which is choice D) 1, 2, 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
