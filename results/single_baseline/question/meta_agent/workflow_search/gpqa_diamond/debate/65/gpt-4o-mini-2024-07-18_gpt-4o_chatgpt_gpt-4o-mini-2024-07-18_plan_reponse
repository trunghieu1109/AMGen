        "response": "All agents agree that the operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime, and Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and translations, making it a broader symmetry that must also be respected. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories. CP symmetry, however, is not universally conserved, as CP violation is observed in certain weak interactions. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries, which is choice D) 1, 2, 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
