The problem involves an equimolar mixture of two liquids X that decolorizes bromine water, suggesting the presence of alkenes or alkynes. Upon treatment with platinum when heated, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating saturation or absence of C=C or C≡C bonds. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This mass fraction corresponds to the hydrocarbon C7H8, known as toluene, which is a common solvent. The mixture X likely consists of two alkenes that upon disproportionation and hydrogenation form toluene. Since Z is C7H8, the original mixture X must have a total of 12 hydrogen atoms (6 per molecule, assuming two identical molecules like C6H6). Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is 12.

### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:
The problem involves an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated compounds (likely alkenes or alkynes). When treated with platinum and heat, mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, suggesting that Y consists of saturated compounds. Upon hydrogenation, both mixtures X and Y form a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, indicating the molecular formula of Z. The lack of further reaction with hydrogen and the use of Z as a solvent suggest that Z is likely a saturated hydrocarbon, possibly an alkane. Given the hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, we can calculate the molecular formula of Z. The molecular formula can be derived using the equation: (number of hydrogen atoms * 1) / (number of carbon atoms * 12 + number of hydrogen atoms * 1) = 0.1428. Solving this gives C7H8 (toluene), but toluene does not fit the description since it should be saturated and not react with bromine. Instead, C6H14 (hexane) fits the solvent description. Therefore, each of the original unsaturated compounds in mixture X must have 8 hydrogen atoms to satisfy the condition that the hydrogenation product has 14 hydrogen atoms. Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 16.

The problem involves identifying compounds based on their reactions. Mixture X contains two unsaturated compounds that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds. Disproportionation with platinum leads to mixture Y, which doesn&#39;t decolorize bromine water, implying saturation or no C=C bonds. Hydrogenation of both X and Y leads to a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This fraction suggests that Z is toluene (C7H8), a solvent. The molar mass of toluene is 92 g/mol, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (8*1)/(92) = 0.087 or 8.7%, which seems incorrect. Correcting this to match the given 14.28%, we find Z is C6H6 (benzene), with a molar mass of 78 g/mol, and hydrogen mass fraction as (6*1)/(78) = 0.0769 or 7.69%, which is also incorrect. Correct calculations lead to C5H12 (pentane) with a molar mass of 72 g/mol, hydrogen fraction (12*1)/(72) = 0.1667 or 16.67%, which is closer but not exact. Finally, considering the right compound, cyclohexane (C6H12) fits perfectly with a molar mass of 84 g/mol, hydrogen mass fraction (12*1)/(84) = 0.1428 or 14.28%. Therefore, Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. X must be an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Each compound in X contributes 6 carbon atoms, totaling 12 hydrogen atoms per molecule. Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two molecules of mixture X is 12 + 12 = 24.

The problem involves an equimolar mixture X that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes or alkynes. Upon treatment with platinum and heat, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, suggesting the absence of unsaturation. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Calculating the molecular formula of Z using the mass fraction: Hydrogen mass fraction = (number of hydrogen atoms * atomic mass of hydrogen) / (molecular mass of Z). Given hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, we set up the equation: (n * 1) / M = 0.1428, where n is the number of hydrogen atoms and M is the molecular mass. Solving for a common hydrocarbon, C7H8 (toluene), which has a hydrogen mass fraction close to 14.28%. This suggests Z is C7H8. Since Z is toluene, and it is a constituent of mixture Y, one of the compounds in mixture X must be C7H8. The other compound in mixture X must be an unsaturated hydrocarbon that can be hydrogenated to C7H8. The simplest possibility is that mixture X consists of C7H8 and C7H6 (phenylacetylene), which upon hydrogenation both yield C7H8. C7H6 has 6 hydrogens, and C7H8 has 8 hydrogens. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 6 + 8 = 14.
