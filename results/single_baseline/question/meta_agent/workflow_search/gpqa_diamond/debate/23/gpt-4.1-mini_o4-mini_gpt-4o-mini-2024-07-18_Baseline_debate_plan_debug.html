### thinking by Debate Agent aich:
We recognize that the only reaction that fits is the Pt‐catalyzed disproportionation of cyclohexadienes: two molecules of C6H8 (no conjugation if they are 1,3‐ and 1,4‐cyclohexadiene) give cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Both cyclohexadienes decolorize Br2, but benzene and cyclohexane do not. Under H2/Pt, benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane, so both mixtures yield only cyclohexane (Z, C6H12) which has H mass fraction 14.28%. Thus X is equimolar 1,3‐ and 1,4‐cyclohexadiene, each C6H8 (8 H atoms), so total H atoms = 8 + 8 = 16.

### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:
We must identify the hydrocarbon Z given its H mass fraction 14.28%: solving H/(12 C+H)=0.1428 gives H/C=2, so formula CnH2n. Z is saturated and doesn’t react with H2, so it’s cyclic: cyclohexane (C6H12). Under Pt at high temperature, two unsaturated liquids (mixture X) disproportionate to equimolar benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) without net H loss from the liquid phase (intramolecular H transfer). Thus the total H in the two products equals the total H in the two reactants: 6+12=18. Hence the total number of H atoms in the two X-liquids is 18.

### thinking by Debate Agent YWUl:
Let the two unsaturated liquids in X be A and B. They decolorize Br2 (thus C=C) and have no conjugated bonds. Pt-catalyzed disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) gives one saturated and one dehydrogenated product in Y, neither decolorizing Br2. Hydrogenation of both X and Y yields only hydrocarbon Z with H mass fraction 14.28%, so m/(12n+m)=0.1428 ⇒ m=2n ⇒ Z is C6H12 (cyclohexane), a common solvent that does not add H2 further. Thus disproportionation: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 + C6H6. So X is equimolar cyclohexene (10 H) + 1,4-cyclohexadiene (8 H), total H = 10+8 = 18.

### thinking by Debate Agent IA6k:
Let Z be the hydrocarbon with H mass fraction 14.28%. Solve m/(12n+m)=1/7 gives m=2n. The simplest is C6H12, cyclohexane, a common solvent that does not hydrogenate further. Mixture Y must be an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene (benzene doesn’t decolorize Br2 and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions). Mixture X must be an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated C6 compounds that upon Pt‐catalyzed disproportionation give C6H12 + C6H6, namely cyclohexene (C6H10) and nonconjugated 1,4‐cyclohexadiene (C6H8). These decolorize Br2, have no conjugated double bonds, and both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The total H atoms in C6H10 + C6H8 = 10 + 8 = 18.

    <pre>Let Z be the hydrocarbon formed by complete hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y. Given the mass fraction of H in Z is 14.28%, solving H/(12 C+H)=0.1428 gives H/C=2, the simplest being C6H12 (cyclohexane), a common solvent that does not hydrogenate further. Mixture Y, formed by Pt‐catalyzed disproportionation of the two liquids in X, must contain no C=C (no Br2 decolorization) and yield Z on hydrogenation, so Y is equimolar benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Thus X must be two nonconjugated C6 hydrocarbons with C=C that transfer H2 intramolecularly to give benzene and cyclohexane: namely cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both decolorize Br2 and have no conjugated double bonds. Their disproportionation: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6. Total H atoms in the two X-liquids = 10 + 8 = 18.
