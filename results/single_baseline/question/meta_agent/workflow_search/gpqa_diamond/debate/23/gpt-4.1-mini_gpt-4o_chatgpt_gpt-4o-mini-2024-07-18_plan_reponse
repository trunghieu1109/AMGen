            "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.",

        "response": "The problem involves identifying the hydrocarbon Z based on its hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This mass fraction corresponds to toluene (C7H8), which is a common solvent and does not react further with hydrogen. Mixture X consists of two unsaturated compounds that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes. Upon hydrogenation, both mixtures X and Y yield toluene. Since mixture X does not have conjugated multiple bonds, it likely consists of two alkenes. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X should be consistent with the formation of toluene upon hydrogenation. The correct answer is 16, as this would correspond to two alkenes with a total of 16 hydrogen atoms, such as C7H8 (toluene) and another unsaturated form that hydrogenates to toluene.\n\nAnswer:C)",
