### thinking by Debate Agent aich:
To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the information given. The mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturation, such as double bonds. However, it is noted that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. The fact that the hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y yields only one hydrocarbon Z suggests that both mixtures contain compounds that can be fully hydrogenated to yield the same product. The mass fraction of hydrogen in hydrocarbon Z is given as 14.28%. This suggests that Z is likely a simple alkane or cycloalkane, as it does not react further with hydrogen and is a solvent. We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X based on these clues. Given the choices provided, I will analyze the likely structures that could fit the criteria and yield the total number of hydrogen atoms. Based on typical organic compounds that fit the description, and the choices available, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is likely to be 22, as this aligns with common hydrocarbons that can decolorize bromine water.

To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the information provided. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water, indicating that they likely contain double bonds or are unsaturated. The hydrogenation process leads to a hydrocarbon Z with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. The molecular formula for Z can be derived from the mass fraction, which corresponds to a certain number of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen and has no conjugated multiple bonds, we can infer about the saturation of mixture X. The possible total hydrogen counts in the options provided need to be evaluated based on typical unsaturated hydrocarbons. Analyzing the options, 22 hydrogen atoms in total for two liquids in mixture X is plausible considering common unsaturated compounds. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is likely to be 22.

To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the information provided. Mixture X consists of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water, suggesting they are unsaturated compounds (likely alkenes or alkynes). When these liquids are treated with platinum and heated, they undergo disproportionation to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating that mixture Y consists of saturated compounds. The hydrocarbon Z formed from the hydrogenation of both mixtures has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. The molecular formula of Z can be derived from this mass fraction. Given the context and the fact that mixture X does not have conjugated multiple bonds, we can assume the two liquids in mixture X are likely to be simple alkenes. A common pair of alkenes that fits this description is ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6), which would give a total of 10 hydrogen atoms. However, we need to find a pair that adds up to the options provided. After considering various combinations and the requirement for the total hydrogen atoms to match one of the choices, we can conclude that a total of 18 hydrogen atoms could be a plausible combination from two larger alkenes. Hence, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is likely to be 18.

To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the information provided. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating that it contains unsaturated compounds (like alkenes or alkynes) that can react with bromine. The hydrogenation of mixture X and mixture Y produces a hydrocarbon Z with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Given that Z is a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen, it likely has a stable structure, possibly a saturated hydrocarbon. The lack of conjugated double bonds in mixture X suggests that its components might be alkenes or alkynes with a certain number of hydrogen atoms. By calculating the possible structures and the number of hydrogen atoms based on the stoichiometry of the reactions and the characteristics of the compounds involved, we can identify the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X. The choices provided suggest specific totals, and by analyzing the molecular formulas of likely candidates, we can deduce the correct answer. After considering the possible combinations and their hydrogen counts, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the liquids of mixture X is likely to be 22, which fits the criteria for the types of compounds described.
