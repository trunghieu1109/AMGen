Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let Z be the hydrocarbon formed by complete hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y. Given the mass fraction of H in Z is 14.28%, solving H/(12 C+H)=0.1428 gives H/C=2, the simplest being C6H12 (cyclohexane), a common solvent that does not hydrogenate further. Mixture Y, formed by Pt‐catalyzed disproportionation of the two liquids in X, must contain no C=C (no Br2 decolorization) and yield Z on hydrogenation, so Y is equimolar benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Thus X must be two nonconjugated C6 hydrocarbons with C=C that transfer H2 intramolecularly to give benzene and cyclohexane: namely cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both decolorize Br2 and have no conjugated double bonds. Their disproportionation: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6. Total H atoms in the two X-liquids = 10 + 8 = 18.
