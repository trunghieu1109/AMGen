            "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.",

        "response": "To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we analyze the information provided. Mixture X consists of two unsaturated liquids that can decolorize bromine water, indicating they likely contain double bonds. The hydrogenation of both mixtures yields a hydrocarbon Z with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. This suggests that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. The options provided for the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X are 22, 12, 16, and 18. After considering the characteristics of the compounds and the reactions involved, the most plausible total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 22, as it aligns with common unsaturated hydrocarbons that can decolorize bromine water. Therefore, the final answer is 22.\n\nAnswer:22",
