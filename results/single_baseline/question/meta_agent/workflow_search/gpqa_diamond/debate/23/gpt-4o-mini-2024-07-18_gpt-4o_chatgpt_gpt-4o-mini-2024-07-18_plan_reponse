            "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.",

        "response": "The problem involves an equimolar mixture X of two unsaturated compounds that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of C=C or C\u2261C bonds. Upon treatment with platinum and heat, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, suggesting saturation. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields a single hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This mass fraction corresponds to the hydrocarbon C6H12 (cyclohexane), which is a common solvent. The original mixture X must consist of two unsaturated compounds that upon hydrogenation form cyclohexane. Each compound in X contributes 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms, totaling 12 hydrogen atoms per molecule. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 12 + 12 = 24. However, considering the options given, the closest logical choice is 16, which suggests a possible oversight in the calculation or interpretation of the problem. Therefore, the answer is C) 16.\n\nAnswer:C)",
