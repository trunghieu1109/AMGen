Question: Example(question='Consider this density matrix\n\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nWhat is its geometrical position in the qubits space?', choice1='r=(0,0,0)', choice2='r=(1,1,1)', choice3='r=(0,0,1)', choice4='r=(1,1,0)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The density matrix given is \( \rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|) \), which represents a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, a completely mixed state is located at the center of the sphere. The Bloch vector for this state is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \). All agents agree that this corresponds to choice A).
