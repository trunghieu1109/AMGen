Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent fUCm', content='For circular orbits and equal star/planet masses, the radial velocity semi‐amplitude K ∝ P^(−1/3). The observed wavelength shift Δλ ∝ K, so Δλ1/Δλ2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Rearranging gives P2/P1 = (Δλ1/Δλ2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

K2/K1=7/5=1.4 ⇒ P2/P1=(K2/K1)^(–3)=(1.4)^(–3)≈0.36.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent oNfd:\nThe radial velocity semi‐amplitude K for a circular orbit scales as K ∝ (m_p sin i) / (M_star)^{2/3} · (2πG/P)^{1/3}. For identical star and planet masses and inclinations, K ∝ P^{-1/3}. We measure K ∝ Δλ, so K1/K2 = (Δλ1)/(Δλ2) = 5/7. Thus (P2/P1)^{1/3} = K1/K2 = 5/7, giving P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.36.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 0LsG:\nThe measured RV amplitude K is proportional to the observed wavelength shift Δλ (via Δλ/λ=v/c) and to P^(–1/3) for circular orbits (K∝P^(–1/3) for fixed star and planet masses). Here Δλ2/Δλ1=7/5=1.4, so K2/K1=1.4 and K1/K2=1/1.4≈0.714. Then P2/P1=(K1/K2)^3≈0.714^3≈0.36.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent IQai:\nWe have two planets of equal mass m_p orbiting stars of equal mass m_* in circular orbits. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K ∝ (m_p/m_*^(2/3))·P^(−1/3). The Doppler shift Δλ ∝K, so Δλ₁/Δλ₂=(P₂/P₁)^(1/3). Thus P₂/P₁=(Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³=(5/7)³=125/343≈0.364. Hence planet #2’s period is ∼0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6GRO:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent oNfd:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 0LsG:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent IQai:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
