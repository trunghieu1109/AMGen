            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "response": "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the periodic shifts in the spectral lines caused by the planets' gravitational influence on their stars. The observed shifts are 5 miliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 miliangstrom for planet #2. The ratio of these shifts suggests that the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. Specifically, the ratio of the shifts (7/5) indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 1.4 times longer than that of planet #1. This conclusion is supported by multiple analyses of the relationship between the radial velocity shifts and the orbital periods. Therefore, the correct answer is that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 1.40 times longer than that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer:~ 1.40",
