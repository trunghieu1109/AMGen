            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "response": "The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of spectral lines to determine the velocity of a star due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the star. Given that the periodic wavelength shift of planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom and that of planet #1 is 5 miliangstrom, planet #2 causes a larger shift and thus has a shorter orbital period. The ratio of the shifts (7/5) can be used to find the ratio of the orbital periods, considering the relationship between velocity and orbital period. Since the wavelength shift is inversely proportional to the orbital period for circular orbits, the period of planet #2 is 5/7 times that of planet #1. However, the question asks how many times the period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, so we take the reciprocal of 5/7, which is 7/5 or approximately 1.40.\n\nAnswer:B)",
