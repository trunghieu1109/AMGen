    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.36&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 1.40&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 1.96&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 0.85&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
Radial velocity amplitude K∝P^(–1/3) for fixed star and planet mass. K2/K1=7/5=1.4 ⇒ P2/P1=(K2/K1)^(–3)=(1.4)^(–3)≈0.36.

### thinking by Debate Agent oNfd:
The radial velocity semi‐amplitude K for a circular orbit scales as K ∝ (m_p sin i) / (M_star)^{2/3} · (2πG/P)^{1/3}. For identical star and planet masses and inclinations, K ∝ P^{-1/3}. We measure K ∝ Δλ, so K1/K2 = (Δλ1)/(Δλ2) = 5/7. Thus (P2/P1)^{1/3} = K1/K2 = 5/7, giving P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.36.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0LsG:
The measured RV amplitude K is proportional to the observed wavelength shift Δλ (via Δλ/λ=v/c) and to P^(–1/3) for circular orbits (K∝P^(–1/3) for fixed star and planet masses). Here Δλ2/Δλ1=7/5=1.4, so K2/K1=1.4 and K1/K2=1/1.4≈0.714. Then P2/P1=(K1/K2)^3≈0.714^3≈0.36.

### thinking by Debate Agent IQai:
We have two planets of equal mass m_p orbiting stars of equal mass m_* in circular orbits. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K ∝ (m_p/m_*^(2/3))·P^(−1/3). The Doppler shift Δλ ∝K, so Δλ₁/Δλ₂=(P₂/P₁)^(1/3). Thus P₂/P₁=(Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³=(5/7)³=125/343≈0.364. Hence planet #2’s period is ∼0.36 times that of planet #1.

    <pre>For circular orbits and equal star/planet masses, the radial velocity semi‐amplitude K ∝ P^(−1/3). The observed wavelength shift Δλ ∝ K, so Δλ1/Δλ2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Rearranging gives P2/P1 = (Δλ1/Δλ2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.
