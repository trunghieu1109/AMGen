    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.36&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 1.40&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 1.96&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 0.85&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of the host star. The shift is caused by the gravitational pull of the planet on the star. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the star. If we have two stars with planets causing different shifts, the ratio of the shifts gives us the ratio of the velocities. The velocity of the star due to the planet is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period (Kepler&#39;s Third Law). Therefore, the ratio of the periods is the inverse square of the ratio of the velocities. Given the wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms and for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, the velocity ratio is 5/7. The period ratio is (7/5)^2. Calculating this gives us (7/5)^2 = 49/25 = 1.96.

### thinking by Debate Agent oNfd:
To determine the ratio of the orbital periods of the two planets, we can use Kepler&#39;s Third Law, which relates the orbital period of a planet to the semi-major axis of its orbit and the mass of the star. However, in this problem, we are given information about the radial velocity (RV) method, which involves measuring the Doppler shift of spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the planet on the star. The wavelength shift is proportional to the velocity of the star due to the planet&#39;s gravitational pull. Since the stars have the same mass, we can compare the velocity amplitudes to find the ratio of the orbital periods. The velocity amplitude for a circular orbit is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the orbital period. Given that the wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 miliangstroms and for planet #2 is 7 miliangstroms, the velocity amplitude of the star hosting planet #2 is higher, indicating a shorter orbital period. The ratio of the orbital periods is inversely proportional to the ratio of the velocity amplitudes. Calculating this, we find the ratio of the orbital periods is (5/7), which is approximately 0.71. Therefore, the period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 by a factor of approximately 1/0.71, which is ~1.40.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0LsG:
The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift of the star&#39;s spectral lines. The shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn is related to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The velocity of the star is proportional to the amplitude of the spectral line shift. Given that both planets have similar masses and the stars have similar masses, the amplitude of the spectral line shift is inversely related to the orbital period of the planets. The shift for planet #1 is 5 miliangstroms, and for planet #2 it is 7 miliangstroms. The period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 by the inverse ratio of their shifts. Therefore, the period of planet #2 is 5/7 times that of planet #1, which is approximately 0.71. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1, making choice 0.36 the closest answer.

### thinking by Debate Agent IQai:
The radial velocity (RV) method involves detecting the periodic shift in the spectral lines of a star due to the gravitational influence of an orbiting planet. The shift in the spectral line wavelength is related to the velocity of the star, which in turn is influenced by the planet&#39;s mass and its orbital period. The wavelength shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. Given that the periodic wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 miliangstrom and for planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom, the velocity of the star hosting planet #2 is greater. Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the velocity ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period ratio (from Kepler&#39;s third law, which relates orbital period to the semi-major axis and hence to velocity for circular orbits). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods T2/T1 is (v1/v2)^2. With v1/v2 = 5/7, T2/T1 = (5/7)^2 = 25/49 ≈ 0.51. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.51 times that of planet #1. However, the question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the inverse of this ratio, 1/0.51 ≈ 1.96.
