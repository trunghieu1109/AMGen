            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "response": "The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines. The shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is related to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The velocity of the star is proportional to the amplitude of the spectral line shift. Given that both planets have similar masses and the stars have similar masses, the amplitude of the spectral line shift is inversely related to the orbital period of the planets. The shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it is 7 milliangstroms. The period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 by the inverse square of the ratio of their shifts. Therefore, the period of planet #2 is (7/5)^2 times that of planet #1, which is 49/25 = 1.96. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 1.96 times longer than that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer:C)",
