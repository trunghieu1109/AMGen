Relativistic two-body decay gives p=(√[(1^2−0.99^2)(1^2−0.33^2)]/(2·1))Mc≈0.0666M c, so E_h=√[(pc)^2+(m_hc^2)^2]≈199.005 GeV and T_h_rel=E_h−m_hc^2≈1.005 GeV. Classically, T_h_cl=Q·m_l/(m_h+m_l)=3 GeV·0.3333≈1.000 GeV. Difference≈5 MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 4Wt1:\nWe have an initial nucleus of mass M at rest (M c^2 = 300 GeV) that fissions into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2 m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Thus m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M, and the total kinetic energy released is ΔM c^2 = (0.01 M) c^2 = 3 GeV. \n\nClassically (nonrelativistically), kinetic energy divides inversely to mass: T1_classical = (m2/(m1 + m2))·3 GeV = (0.33 M/0.99 M)·3 GeV = 1 GeV.\n\nRelativistically, the fragment momentum p is given by \np c = sqrt[(M^2 - (m1 + m2)^2)(M^2 - (m1 - m2)^2)]/(2M) c \n     ≃ 0.0666 M c^2 ≃ 19.98 GeV.\nThen E1 = sqrt((p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2) ≃ sqrt((19.98)^2 + (198)^2) GeV ≃ 198.9983 GeV, so\nT1_exact = E1 - m1 c^2 ≃ 0.9983 GeV.\n\nThus the classical estimate exceeds the exact value by about 1.7 MeV ≃ 2 MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent FnJb:\nInitial mass M=300 GeV splits into m1=2m2, with m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=0.66M=198 GeV, m2=0.33M=99 GeV. Q=(M−m1−m2)c²=0.01M=3 GeV. Classically T1_cl=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3·(0.33/0.99)=1 GeV. Relativistically, solve 0.66√(1+x)+0.33√(1+4x)=1 for x=(p/(m1c))² ⇒ x≈0.01017 ⇒ T1_rel=m1(√(1+x)−1)=198·(√1.01017−1)≈1.0054 GeV. Difference ≈5.4 MeV≈5 MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Rqx1:\nInitial rest energy M c^2=300 GeV, fragments masses m1: m2=2:1 give m1=0.66M, m2=0.33M. Mass defect Q=0.01M c^2=3 GeV. Nonrelativistic T1_cl=Q*(m2/(m1+m2))=3*(1/3)=1 GeV. Exact T1 solves T1^2+2m1T1=(Q−T1)^2+2m2(Q−T1) with m1=198 GeV,m2=99 GeV,Q=3 GeV → T1=603/600≈1.005 GeV.
