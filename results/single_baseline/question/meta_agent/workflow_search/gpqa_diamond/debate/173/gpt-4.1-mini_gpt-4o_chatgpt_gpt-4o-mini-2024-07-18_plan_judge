Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, leaving 3 GeV as kinetic energy. The more massive fragment has a rest-mass of 0.66M, and the less massive one has 0.33M. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations for the more massive fragment is determined to be 10 MeV by all agents. This consistent agreement among the agents suggests that the correct answer is choice A).
