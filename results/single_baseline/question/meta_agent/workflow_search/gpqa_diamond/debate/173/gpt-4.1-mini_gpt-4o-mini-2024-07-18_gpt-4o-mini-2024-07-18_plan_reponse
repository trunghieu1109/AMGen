            "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)",

        "response": "To determine the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the classical approximation, we first analyze the fission process. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV, and it splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other. The total mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, leading to the equations for the masses of the fragments. After calculating the masses, we apply conservation of energy and momentum to find the relativistic kinetic energy T1. The classical approximation uses a simpler kinetic energy formula. The calculations show that the difference between the two T1 values is 10 MeV, which aligns with the provided choices. Therefore, the correct answer is 10 MeV.\n\nAnswer:10 MeV.",
