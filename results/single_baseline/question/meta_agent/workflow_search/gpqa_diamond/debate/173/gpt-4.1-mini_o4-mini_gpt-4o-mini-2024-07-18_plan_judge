Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Initial nucleus M c^2=300 GeV splits into m1=2m2 with m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=0.66M=198 GeV, m2=0.33M=99 GeV. Mass defect Q=(M−m1−m2)c^2=0.01M c^2=3 GeV. Nonrelativistically T1_cl=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3·(99/297)=1.000 GeV. Relativistically, using conservation of energy and momentum gives T1_exact=(Q^2+2m2Q)/[2(m1+m2+Q)]=(9+594)/600=603/600=1.005 GeV. Difference=1.005−1.000=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.
