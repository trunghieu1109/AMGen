What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent P6bt:
To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we first need to determine how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present in 0.1 g. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic acid (it can react with three protons), we need three moles of H+ ions to completely dissolve it. This means we require 0.000935 moles x 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. Given that the strong acid is 0.1 M, the volume of the acid needed is 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L or 28.05 cm3. For the pH, when we add 28.05 cm3 of a strong acid, the concentration of H+ ions will be 0.1 M, and the pH can be calculated as pH = -log[H+]. The total H+ concentration would be approximately 0.1 M, leading to a pH of around 2. Therefore, the answer is choice 1: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.

### thinking by Debate Agent CG4E:
To find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first need to determine the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Thus, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 corresponds to about 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, it will react with the strong acid to form Fe^3+ ions and water. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions to fully dissolve, leading to a total of 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3 requiring 0.002805 moles of H+. Given that the acid is 0.1 M, we can calculate the volume of acid needed using the formula: Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration. Therefore, Volume = 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L, which is 28.05 cm3. To find the pH of the resulting solution, we calculate the concentration of H+ ions after the reaction. The total volume after adding the acid will be 100 cm3 + 28.05 cm3 = 128.05 cm3. The concentration of H+ ions will be 0.002805 moles / 0.12805 L = 0.0219 M. The pH is then calculated as pH = -log[H+], which gives approximately 2.04.

To determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Thus, the number of moles in 0.1 g is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and will react with the strong acid, we need an equivalent amount of acid to neutralize the base. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 will require 3 moles of H+ ions from the acid. Therefore, we need 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3 * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. In a 0.1 M solution, the volume of acid required is calculated using the formula: Volume (L) = moles / concentration. Thus, Volume = 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L or 28.05 cm3. Now, to find the pH of the resulting solution, we note that after adding the acid, the solution will have an excess of H+ ions. The total volume after adding 28.05 cm3 of acid to 100 cm3 of solution is 128.05 cm3. The concentration of H+ ions will be 0.002805 moles in 0.12805 L, which gives us a concentration of approximately 0.0219 M. The pH is calculated as -log(0.0219) which is approximately 1.66. However, checking the provided choices, the closest match for pH which indicates a strong acidic solution is pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3. Therefore, the answer is pH 2.04 with the volume of acid required being 28.05 cm3.

### thinking by Debate Agent q6yB:
To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we first need to understand its solubility and the reaction with a strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a weakly soluble compound, and we need to provide enough protons (H+) from the strong acid to dissolve it. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 corresponds to about 0.000935 moles. To dissolve this amount, we need to provide at least this many moles of H+. Given that we are using a 0.1 M strong acid, we can calculate the volume of acid needed. The pH of the resulting solution will depend on the concentration of H+ ions after dissolution. After calculating, we find that the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed is 28.05 cm3 and the resulting pH is 2.04.
