Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: M ≃ 55.85 + 3×17.01 = 106.88 g/mol, so n = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≃ 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. Dissolution requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)3, so n_H⁺ = 3 × 9.36×10⁻⁴ = 2.81×10⁻³ mol. Using a 0.1 M strong acid, V = n / C = 2.81×10⁻³ mol / 0.1 M = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm³. After all H⁺ is consumed, the solution contains Fe³⁺ (9.36×10⁻⁴ mol in 0.1281 L) which hydrolyzes (Ka1 ≃ 6.3×10⁻³) to give pH ≃ 2.04. Thus the correct answer is choice A.
