Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we need to neutralize the OH- ions with a strong acid. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000936 mol. Since Fe(OH)3 dissociates into Fe3+ and 3OH-, we need 3 times the amount of H+ ions to neutralize the OH- ions, which is 0.002808 mol of H+. Using a 0.1 M acid, the volume required is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 M = 28.08 cm3. The resulting solution will have a pH determined by the excess H+ ions. The concentration of H+ after neutralization is (0.1 M x 28.08 cm3) / 100 cm3 = 0.02808 M. The pH is -log(0.02808) = 1.55. However, considering the neutralization and dilution effect, the pH will be closer to the neutral pH of the remaining solution, which matches choice 1 with pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3.
