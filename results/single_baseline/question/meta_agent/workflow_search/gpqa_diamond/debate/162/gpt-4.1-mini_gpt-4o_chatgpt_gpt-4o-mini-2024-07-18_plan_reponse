        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to neutralize the OH- ions with H+ ions from the strong acid. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O. We calculated the moles of Fe(OH)3 as 0.000936 mol, requiring 3 times the moles of H+ (0.002808 mol). For a 0.1 M acid, the volume needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 M = 28.08 cm3. The pH calculation based on the resulting H+ concentration in the total volume (100 cm3 + 28.08 cm3) gives a pH close to 2.04. Therefore, the best choice is A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.\n\nAnswer:A)",
