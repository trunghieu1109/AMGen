        "response": "To determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions to fully dissolve, we need 0.000935 moles * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. For a 0.1 M strong acid, the volume needed is 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L, which is 28.05 cm3. The pH of the resulting solution can be calculated based on the concentration of H+ ions after adding the acid. The total volume after adding the acid will be 128.05 cm3, and the concentration of H+ ions will be approximately 0.0219 M, leading to a pH of around 2.04. Therefore, the answer is pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.\n\nAnswer:pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3",
