        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "5-Butylnona-2,6-diene is a 1,5-diene that undergoes a thermal Cope [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In this rearrangement two carbons of the butyl side chain become part of the main chain, converting the 9-carbon chain into a 10-carbon (deca) chain with double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The remaining two carbons of the original butyl group end up as substituents: an ethyl at C5 and a methyl at C4. This corresponds to choice C.\n\nAnswer:C",
