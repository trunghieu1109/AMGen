Question: Example(question='Which of the following molecules is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated?', choice1='4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene', choice2='5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene', choice3='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', choice4='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: 5-Butylnona-2,6-diene is a 1,5-diene that undergoes a thermal Cope [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In this rearrangement two carbons of the butyl side chain become part of the main chain, converting the 9-carbon chain into a 10-carbon (deca) chain with double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The remaining two carbons of the original butyl group end up as substituents: an ethyl at C5 and a methyl at C4. This corresponds to choice C.

Answer:C
