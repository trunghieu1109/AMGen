        "response": "The starting C8H9NO with a 9.72 ppm triplet (CHO), 3.66 ppm doublet (CH2), para\u2010disubstituted aromatic signals, and NH2 signal corresponds to p-aminomethylbenzaldehyde (p-NH2\u2013C6H4\u2013CH2\u2013CHO). NaNO2/HCl then hydrolyzes the diazonium to a phenol, giving p-hydroxybenzyl aldehyde (p-OH\u2013C6H4\u2013CH2\u2013CHO). Under strong base and heat this aldehyde self\u2013aldolizes: deprotonation at CH2 forms an enolate that attacks the aldehyde of another molecule, yielding a \u03b2-hydroxy dimer which dehydrates upon heating to the final \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated dimeric aldehyde with two p-hydroxyphenyl substituents at C2 and C4, i.e. 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (choice 3).\n\nAnswer:C",
