Question: Example(question='The reaction between cyclohexanone and piperidine can result in the formation of a cyclic imine, also known as a Schiff base. This type of reaction is a classic example of imine formation, which involves the condensation of a ketone (cyclohexanone in this case) with a primary amine (piperidine) in the presence of an acid catalyst.\nWhat will be the favorable acid used (A) and the final product (B) of the following reaction?\nCyclohexanone + piperidine + (A, acrylaldehyde, H3O+) ---> B', choice1='A = TsOH, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal', choice2='A = HCl, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal', choice3='A = TsOH, B = 1-(2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexylidene)piperidin-1-ium', choice4='A = HCl, B = 1-(2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexylidene)piperidin-1-ium', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Piperidine (a secondary amine) and cyclohexanone form an enamine under mild acid catalysis. p-Toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is ideal because it’s strong enough to promote enamine formation but not so strong that it protonates the amine. The enamine then undergoes a Michael addition with acrylaldehyde, and subsequent acid hydrolysis (H₃O⁺) regenerates the ketone and yields the aldehyde 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal.
