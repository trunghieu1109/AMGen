        "response": "The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), so plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which means it varies as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. This is the number of stars per unit solid angle. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which requires considering the volume element in spherical coordinates, scaling as r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance scales as r^5 * r^2 = r^7. But since we are considering the number of stars per unit range of distance, we should consider the original variation with parallax, which is r^5, and account for the fact that we are considering a range of distances, not solid angle, leading to a final dependence on r^2. However, the correct interpretation is that the number of stars per unit range of distance should be r^3, as the volume element scales as r^2 and the number of stars per unit solid angle scales as r^5, leading to r^5/r^2 = r^3.\n\nAnswer:C) ~ r^3",
