Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent jU45', content='All agents agree that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. By substituting plx with 1/r, the expression becomes 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5. All agents consistently conclude that the number of stars varies with distance as r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, resulting in the number of stars varying as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 37LZ:\nThe parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r. Thus, 1/plx^5 becomes (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent lCbv:\nParallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we substitute plx with 1/r, resulting in the expression for the number of stars as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent AkSk:\nParallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Substituting plx ~ 1/r into 1/plx^5 gives us 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5 per unit range of distance.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent d793:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 37LZ:\nD) ~ r^5\n\n### answer by Debate Agent lCbv:\nD) ~ r^5\n\n### answer by Debate Agent AkSk:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
