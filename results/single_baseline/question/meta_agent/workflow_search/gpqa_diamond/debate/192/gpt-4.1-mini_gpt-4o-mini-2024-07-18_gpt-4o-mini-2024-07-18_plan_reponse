            "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance (r) from the observer, specifically plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. By substituting plx with 1/r, we find that the number of stars can be expressed as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. This indicates that the number of stars increases with the distance raised to the power of 5. Therefore, the correct relationship is that the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.\n\nAnswer:D",
