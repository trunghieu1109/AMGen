    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent Td79:
The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. Therefore, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. However, this is the number of stars per unit solid angle. To find the number of stars per unit range of distance, we need to multiply by the surface area of a sphere at distance r, which is proportional to r^2. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of distance is r^5 * r^2 = r^7. But since the question asks for the variation per unit range of distance, we consider the original variation with parallax, which is r^5, and account for the fact that we are considering a range of distances, not solid angle, leading to a final dependence on r^2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 337L:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), so plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we have number of stars ~ (plx)^-5. Substituting plx ~ 1/r, we get number of stars ~ (1/r)^-5, which simplifies to number of stars ~ r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZlCb:
The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), so plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we substitute plx = 1/r into the equation, giving us the number of stars as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent vAkS:
The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), so plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r, leading to the expression for the number of stars as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. However, since we are considering the number of stars per unit range of distance, we must also consider the volume element in spherical coordinates, which scales as r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance scales as r^5/r^2 = r^3.

### answer by Debate Agent Td79:
~ r^2

### answer by Debate Agent 337L:
D) ~ r^5

### answer by Debate Agent ZlCb:
D) ~ r^5

### answer by Debate Agent vAkS:
