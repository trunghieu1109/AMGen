Given number per unit plx N(plx) ∝ plx^(–5). To find number per unit r: N(r) = N(plx)·|dplx/dr|. Since plx = 1/r, dplx/dr = –1/r^2 so |dplx/dr|=1/r^2. Thus N(r) ∝ plx^(–5)·(1/r^2) = (r^5)·(1/r^2) = r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 337L:\nLet plx∝1/r. Given number per unit parallax n(plx)∝1/plx^5∝r^5. To get number per unit distance n(r)=n(plx)|d(plx)/dr|, and d(plx)/dr=−1/r^2 so |d(plx)/dr|=1/r^2. Thus n(r)∝r^5·1/r^2= r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ZlCb:\nThe observed relation is dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx ∝ 1/r, we have plx=1/r ⇒ d(plx)/dr=−1/r^2. Thus dN/dr = (dN/dplx)*(dplx/dr) ∝ (1/plx^5)*(1/r^2) ∝ r^5 * 1/r^2 = r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vAkS:\nThe observed distribution is N(p) ∝ p⁻⁵ per unit parallax p. With p = 1/r, dp/dr = –1/r² so |dp| = dr/r². Then N(r)dr = N(p)dp ∝ p⁻⁵·(dr/r²) = (r⁵)(dr/r²)=r³dr. Thus per unit r, N(r)∝r³.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Td79:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 337L:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ZlCb:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vAkS:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
