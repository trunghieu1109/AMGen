    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent CbvA:
The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely related to its distance (r) from the observer. Specifically, plx is proportional to 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r to find the relationship with distance. Therefore, the number of stars can be expressed as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. This indicates that the number of stars increases with the distance raised to the power of 5.

### thinking by Debate Agent kSkj:
The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) from the observer, such that plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r to express the number of stars in terms of distance. This gives us: number of stars ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.

The parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r: this gives us the number of stars as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.
