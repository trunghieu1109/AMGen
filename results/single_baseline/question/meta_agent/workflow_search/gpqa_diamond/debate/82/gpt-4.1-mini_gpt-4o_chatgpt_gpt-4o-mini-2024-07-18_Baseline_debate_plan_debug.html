What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point?

### thinking by Debate Agent aOoO:
First, calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are 20.00 cm3 * 0.05 M = 1.00 mmol. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm3, so the concentration becomes 1.00 mmol / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 1.00 mmol = 0.25 mmol. The remaining moles of acetic acid are 0.75 mmol, and the moles of acetate formed are 0.25 mmol. The concentration of acetic acid is 0.75 mmol / 40.00 cm3 = 0.01875 M, and the concentration of acetate is 0.25 mmol / 40.00 cm3 = 0.00625 M. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = -log(1.85x10^-5) + log(0.00625/0.01875) = 4.57. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. The concentration of acetate is 1.00 mmol / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M. Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate: CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-. Using Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.0x10^-14 / 1.85x10^-5 = 5.41x10^-10. Set up the expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-], and solve for [OH-], then find pOH, and finally pH = 14 - pOH. The calculations give pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.

First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm3 * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 water, the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 moles = 0.00025 moles of NaOH react with acetic acid, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. The moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 40.00 cm3 = 0.01875 M and acetate is 0.00025 / 40.00 cm3 = 0.00625 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = pKa + log(0.00625/0.01875). pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5) = 4.73, so pH = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate, with a concentration of 0.001 moles / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M. The pH is calculated using the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa - pKb), where pKb = 14 - pKa = 9.27, so pH = 7 + 0.5(4.73 - 9.27) = 8.52.

### thinking by Debate Agent WjcT:
First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm3 * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 water, the total volume is 40.00 cm3, and the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Moles of NaOH added = 0.001 moles * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles. Therefore, 0.00025 moles of acetate ions are formed, and 0.00075 moles of acetic acid remain. The concentration of acetic acid = 0.00075 moles / 0.04025 L = 0.0186 M, and acetate = 0.00025 moles / 0.04025 L = 0.00621 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = -log(1.85x10^-5) + log(0.00621/0.0186) = 4.74 + (-0.477) = 4.26. At equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ion. Concentration of acetate = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M. Using hydrolysis: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa + log([CH3COO-])) = 7 + 0.5(-4.73 + log(0.02)) = 8.52.

### thinking by Debate Agent G9kx:
To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm3 / 1000) = 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm3. The concentration of acetic acid becomes (0.001 moles) / (0.040 L) = 0.025 M. 

For 25% titration, 25% of acetic acid is neutralized: 0.001 moles * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles. The remaining acetic acid = 0.00075 moles, and acetate ion = 0.00025 moles. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: 
pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = -log(1.85x10^-5) + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.74 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.26. 

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ion: 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.060 L (adding 0.010 L NaOH). The concentration of acetate = 0.001/0.060 = 0.0167 M. 

Using the hydrolysis of acetate: 
CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-, 
Kb = Kw/Ka = 1x10^-14 / 1.85x10^-5 = 5.41x10^-10. 

Calculate [OH-]: 
Kb = [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO-], 
[OH-]^2 = 5.41x10^-10 * 0.0167, 
[OH-] = √(9.03x10^-12) ≈ 9.5x10^-6. 

pOH = -log(9.5x10^-6) ≈ 5.02, 
pH = 14 - pOH = 8.98. 

Therefore, the pH values are closest to choice 4.26 and 8.52.

    <pre>All agents calculated the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution to be 0.025 M. At 25% titration, they determined the remaining acetic acid and formed acetate concentrations, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH at 25% titration as 4.26. At the equivalence point, they calculated the concentration of acetate and used the hydrolysis of acetate to find the pH at the equivalence point as 8.52. All agents agree on these calculations, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is B) 4.26; 8.52.
