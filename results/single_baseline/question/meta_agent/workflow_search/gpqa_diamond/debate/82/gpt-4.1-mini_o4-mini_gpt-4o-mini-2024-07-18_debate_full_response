At 25% titration, moles A– = 0.00025, HA = 0.00075 in total volume 0.0425 L → pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]) = 4.7324 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.26. At equivalence, moles A– = 0.001 in total 0.050 L → [A–] = 0.02 M; Kb = Kw/Ka = 5.41×10^-10, [OH–] = √(C·Kb) = 3.29×10^-6 M → pOH = 5.48 → pH = 8.52. These match choice2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent U3Q0:\nWe start with 0.020 L of 0.05 M acetic acid: n_acid=0.001 mol in 0.040 L after dilution. For 25% titration, 0.25·0.001=0.00025 mol NaOH is added (2.5 mL), total V=0.0425 L. Remaining HA=0.00075 mol, A–=0.00025 mol, so [HA]=0.01765 M, [A–]=0.00588 M. pH=pKa+log([A–]/[HA])=4.732+log(0.3333)=4.26. At equivalence, 0.001 mol NaOH (10 mL) gives 0.001 mol A– in 0.050 L: [A–]=0.02 M. Kb=Kw/Ka=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10, [OH–]≈√(Kb·C)=3.29e-6 M, pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52. Matches choice 2, i.e. B).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent WjcT:\nFirst, calculate moles of acetic acid: n0 = 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. After dilution to 40 mL, [HA] = 0.025 M. Equivalence volume of 0.1 M NaOH is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 mL. At 25% titration, Vb = 2.5 mL; nOH- = 0.00025 mol; remaining HA = 0.00075 mol; A- = 0.00025 mol; total volume = 42.5 mL. [HA] = 0.01765 M; [A-] = 0.00588 M. pKa = -log(1.85×10^-5) = 4.732. By Henderson–Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.732 + log(0.3333) = 4.26. At equivalence: total volume = 50 mL; [A-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M; Kb = Kw/Ka = 1×10^-14/1.85×10^-5 = 5.405×10^-10; [OH-] ≈ sqrt(Kb·c) = sqrt(5.405×10^-10×0.02) = 3.29×10^-6 M; pOH = 5.483; pH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.52. These values match choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent G9kx:\nInitial moles CH3COOH =0.02\u2009L×0.05\u2009M=0.001\u2009mol; after diluting to 40\u2009mL [HA]₀=0.025\u2009M. 25% titration: OH⁻ added=0.00025\u2009mol; [HA]=0.00075/0.0425=0.01765\u2009M, [A⁻]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882\u2009M. pKa=−log\u2009(1.85e−5)=4.732; pH=4.732+log(0.005882/0.01765)=4.26.
