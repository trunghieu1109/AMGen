    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4.57; 6.92  &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;4.26; 8.52&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;4.73; 7.00&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;3.17; 6.73  &#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent aOoO:
First, calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 20.00 cm3 = 0.001 mol. The total volume after dilution is 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3, so the concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. At 25% titration, 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol, and the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = -log(1.85x10^-5) + log(0.00025/0.00075). At the equivalence point, all acetic acid has reacted to form acetate, and the solution contains sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa + log(C)) where C is the concentration of acetate. Calculate the pH values for both scenarios.

### thinking by Debate Agent U3Q0:
First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution: 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid gives 0.001 moles. After dilution, the total volume is 40.00 cm3, so the concentration of acetic acid becomes 0.025 M. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. This means 0.00025 moles of NaOH have reacted with acetic acid, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and forming 0.00025 moles of acetate ion. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Here, pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5) = 4.73. Substituting the concentrations, pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ion. The concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 moles / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M. The pH is calculated using the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa + log([A-])) = 7 + 0.5(4.73 + log(0.025)) = 8.52.

### thinking by Debate Agent WjcT:
First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid gives 0.05 mol/L * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution with 20 cm3 water, the concentration remains the same since the total volume is now 40 cm3. At 25% titration, 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid are neutralized by NaOH. That is 0.001 mol * 25% = 0.00025 mol neutralized, leaving 0.00075 mol of acetic acid and forming 0.00025 mol of acetate. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = -log(1.85x10^-5) + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.74 + (-0.48) = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5*(pKa + log(C)) = 7 + 0.5*(-log(1.85x10^-5) + log(0.025)) = 8.52.

### thinking by Debate Agent G9kx:
First, determine the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 water, the concentration of acetic acid becomes 0.025 M in 40.00 cm3. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 moles = 0.00025 moles of NaOH react with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and producing 0.00025 moles of acetate. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5) ≈ 4.73. The pH at 25% titration is pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles in 60.00 cm3 (40.00 cm3 original solution + 20.00 cm3 NaOH), which is 0.0167 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 0.5(pKa + log(C)), where C is the concentration of acetate. pH = 7 + 0.5(4.73 + log(0.0167)) ≈ 8.52.

    <pre>All agents agree on the calculations and the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the pH at 25% titration and the hydrolysis of acetate for the pH at the equivalence point. They all calculate the pH at 25% titration to be 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point to be 8.52. The choice that matches these values is choice B.
