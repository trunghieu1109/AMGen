Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the calculations and the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the pH at 25% titration and the hydrolysis of acetate for the pH at the equivalence point. They all calculate the pH at 25% titration to be 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point to be 8.52. The choice that matches these values is choice B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
