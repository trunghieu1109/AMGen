Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid is mixed with 20.00 cm3 of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm3. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M. At 25% titration, we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. The pH at this point can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, while at the equivalence point, the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion formed. The calculations yield pH values of approximately 4.57 at 25% titration and 6.92 at the equivalence point, which matches choice 1: 4.57; 6.92.
