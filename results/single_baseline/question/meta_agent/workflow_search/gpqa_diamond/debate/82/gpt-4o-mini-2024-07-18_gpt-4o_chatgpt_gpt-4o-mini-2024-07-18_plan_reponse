        "response": "All agents agree on the calculations and the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the pH at 25% titration and the hydrolysis of acetate for the pH at the equivalence point. They all calculate the pH at 25% titration to be 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point to be 8.52. The choice that matches these values is choice B.\n\nAnswer:B",
