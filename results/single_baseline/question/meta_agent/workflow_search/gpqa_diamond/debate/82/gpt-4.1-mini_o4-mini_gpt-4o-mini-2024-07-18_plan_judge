Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.020 L × 0.05 M = 0.00100 mol. After dilution to 40.00 mL, [HA]₀ = 0.0250 M. At 25% titration, moles OH⁻ added = 0.00025 mol; remaining HA = 0.00075 mol; A⁻ = 0.00025 mol; total volume = 42.50 mL gives [HA] = 0.01765 M and [A⁻] = 0.00588 M. pKa = –log(1.85×10⁻⁵) = 4.732. By Henderson–Hasselbalch, pH = 4.732 + log(0.00588/0.01765) = 4.26. At equivalence, total volume = 50.00 mL, [A⁻] = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.0200 M. Kb = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85×10⁻⁵ = 5.41×10⁻¹⁰; [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb·C) = √(5.41×10⁻¹⁰ × 0.0200) = 3.29×10⁻⁶ M; pOH = 5.48; pH = 14 – 5.48 = 8.52.
