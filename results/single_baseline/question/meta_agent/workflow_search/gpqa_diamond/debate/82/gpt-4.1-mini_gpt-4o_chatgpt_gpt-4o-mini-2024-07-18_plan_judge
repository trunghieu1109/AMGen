Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents calculated the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution to be 0.025 M. At 25% titration, they determined the remaining acetic acid and formed acetate concentrations, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH at 25% titration as 4.26. At the equivalence point, they calculated the concentration of acetate and used the hydrolysis of acetate to find the pH at the equivalence point as 8.52. All agents agree on these calculations, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is B) 4.26; 8.52.
