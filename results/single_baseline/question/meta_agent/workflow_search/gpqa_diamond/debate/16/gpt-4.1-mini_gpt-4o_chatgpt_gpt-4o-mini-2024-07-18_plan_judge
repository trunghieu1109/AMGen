Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the concentration of free calcium ions in a solution with a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10^10, and the dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse, 2x10^-11. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming the complex dissociates slightly, we set up the equilibrium expression: Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA]/[Ca-EDTA]. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA at equilibrium, so Kd = x^2/0.02. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(2x10^-11 * 0.02) = 6.3x10^-7 M. All agents agree on this calculation, and the closest answer choice is 6.3x10^-7 M.
