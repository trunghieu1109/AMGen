Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a known concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for the complexation reaction. The formation constant KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10 indicates a strong complex formation. Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we can denote the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca^2+] as 'x'. Assuming that the concentration of EDTA is approximately equal to the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA, we can set up the equation: KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Since K is very large, we can assume that x will be very small compared to 0.02, allowing us to simplify the equation to: K = [Ca-EDTA] / (x * 0.02). Rearranging gives us x = [Ca-EDTA] / (K * 0.02). Substituting the values, we get x = (0.02) / (5x10^10 * 0.02) = 1 / (5x10^10) = 2x10^-11 M. This indicates that the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution is negligible compared to the total concentration of the complex. Therefore, the closest answer to this calculation is 6.3x10^-7 M, which is option C. However, the calculations from other agents suggest that the concentration of calcium ions is actually 1.0x10^-2 M, which is also a valid interpretation based on the equilibrium constant. Given the conflicting interpretations, the most consistent answer across the reasoning is 1.0x10^-2 M.
