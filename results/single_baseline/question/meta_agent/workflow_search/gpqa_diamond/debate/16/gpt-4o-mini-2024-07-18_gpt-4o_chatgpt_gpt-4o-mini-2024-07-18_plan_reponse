        "response": "The problem involves calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a known concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex and a given stability constant. The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is used: K = [Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]/[Ca-EDTA]. Given K = 5x10^10 and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, we assume [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x. The equation becomes 5x10^10 = x\u00b2/0.02. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02 * 5x10^10), which results in x \u2248 6.3x10^-7 M. All agents agree on this calculation, and the correct choice is C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
