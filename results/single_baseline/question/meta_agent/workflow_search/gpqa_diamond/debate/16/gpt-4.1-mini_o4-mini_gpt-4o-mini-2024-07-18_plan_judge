Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have the equilibrium CaEDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ with formation constant Kf = 5×10¹⁰ = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). The dissociation constant is Kd = 1/Kf = 2×10⁻¹¹ = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[CaEDTA]. Starting with 0.02 M CaEDTA and letting x = [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] formed, the remaining complex is ≈0.02 M. Thus x²/(0.02) = 2×10⁻¹¹ ⇒ x² = 4×10⁻¹³ ⇒ x ≈6.3×10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to choice C).
