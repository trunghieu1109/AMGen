        "response": "The problem involves calculating the concentration of free calcium ions in a solution with a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10^10, and the dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse, 2x10^-11. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming the complex dissociates slightly, we set up the equilibrium expression: Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA]/[Ca-EDTA]. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA at equilibrium, so Kd = x^2/0.02. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(2x10^-11 * 0.02) = 6.3x10^-7 M. All agents agree on this calculation, and the closest answer choice is 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)",
