Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a known concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex and a given stability constant. The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is used: K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA]. Given K = 5x10^10 and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, we assume [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x. The equation becomes 5x10^10 = x²/0.02. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02 * 5x10^10), which results in x ≈ 6.3x10^-7 M. All agents agree on this calculation, and the correct choice is C).
