Starting with 0.02 M CaEDTA, let x = [Ca2+] = [EDTA], then [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02–x ≈ 0.02. So 5×10^10 = 0.02/(x^2) ⇒ x^2 = 0.02/(5×10^10) = 4×10^–13 ⇒ x = 2×10^–6.5 ≈ 6.3×10^–7 M.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent LRYW:\nWe have a stoichiometric solution of 0.02 M Ca–EDTA complex. The given K₍Ca–EDTA₎ = 5×10¹⁰ is the formation constant: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ CaEDTA²⁻ with Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA]) = 5×10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is Kd = 1/Kf = 2×10⁻¹¹.\n\nLet x = [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 − x (x ≪ 0.02). The dissociation equilibrium gives\nKd = [Ca²⁺][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = x²/(0.02 − x) ≈ x²/0.02 = 2×10⁻¹¹.\nSolving x² = 0.02·2×10⁻¹¹ = 4×10⁻¹³ ⇒ x = √(4×10⁻¹³) = 2×10⁻⁶ M. More precisely, solving the quadratic x² + Kd·x − 0.02·Kd = 0 yields x ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThus the free Ca²⁺ concentration is 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, corresponding to choice C).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xdcT:\nWe have the formation constant Kf for Ca-EDTA: Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]) = 5×10^10. The dissociation constant Kd = 1/Kf = 2×10^-11 = [Ca2+][EDTA4–]/[CaEDTA]. Let the small amount dissociated be x = [Ca2+] = [EDTA4–], and remaining complex ≈0.02 – x. Then: x^2/(0.02 – x) = 2×10^-11. Since x << 0.02, approximate denominator as 0.02: x^2 ≈ 2×10^-11 × 0.02 = 4×10^-13, so x ≈√(4×10^-13) = 2×10^-6 M. For more accuracy include x term: solve x^2 + (2×10^-11)x – 4×10^-13 = 0, yielding x ≈6.2×10^-7 M, which matches choice C.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7vBS:\nWe have the equilibrium CaEDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4– with formation constant Kf = 5×10^10, so dissociation constant Kd = 1/Kf = 2×10^–11. If initial [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, and x = [Ca2+] produced at equilibrium, then [EDTA4–] = x and [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 – x ≈ 0.02. Thus Kd = x^2/(0.02) = 2×10^–11 ⇒ x^2 = 4×10^–13 ⇒ x ≈ 6.3×10^–7 M.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Dt0q:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent LRYW:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xdcT:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 7vBS:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
