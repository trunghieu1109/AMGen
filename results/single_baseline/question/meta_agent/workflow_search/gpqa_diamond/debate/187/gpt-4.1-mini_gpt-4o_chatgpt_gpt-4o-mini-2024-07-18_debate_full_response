Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 0smp', content='The interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal can be calculated using the formula: \\[ d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl) \\cos \\alpha}} \\] where a is the interatomic distance, h, k, l are the Miller indices, and \\( \\alpha \\) is the angle between the axes. For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1, a = 10 Angstrom, and \\( \\alpha = 30^{\\circ} \\).

For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1. Substituting the given values: a = 10 Angstrom, \\( \\alpha = 30^{\\circ} \\), we can calculate the interplanar distance.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Ho57:\nTo find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula: d_(hkl) = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2kl cos(beta) + 2hl cos(gamma)). Here, a = 10 Angstrom, h = k = l = 1, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. Converting the angle to radians, we have cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2. Plug these values into the formula to calculate the interplanar distance.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent s1As:\nTo find the interplanar distance (d_hkl) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula: 1/d_hkl² = (h² + k² + l²)(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / (a²sin²α), where h, k, l are the Miller indices, a is the interatomic distance, and α is the angle between the axes. Here, h=k=l=1, a=10 Å, and α=30°. First, calculate the term (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) with α=30°: cos(30°) = √3/2, so cos²(30°) = 3/4 and cos³(30°) = (√3/2)³ = 3√3/8. Thus, 1 - 3(3/4) + 2(3√3/8) = 1 - 9/4 + 3√3/4. Simplifying gives a numeric value. Substitute into the formula and solve for d_hkl.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xU8Z:\nTo find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice: \n\n$$d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos(\\alpha) + \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\cos^2(\\alpha)}{1 - 3\\cos^2(\\alpha) + 2\\cos^3(\\alpha)}}}$$\n\nHere, $a$ is the interatomic distance, and $\\alpha$ is the angle between the axes. For the (111) plane, $h=k=l=1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we have:\n\n$$d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1)\\cos(30^{\\circ}) + \\frac{(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)\\cos^2(30^{\\circ})}{1 - 3\\cos^2(30^{\\circ}) + 2\\cos^3(30^{\\circ})}}}$$\n\nSimplifying further, we calculate:\n\n$\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\sqrt{3}/2$.\n\nSubstitute and simplify the expression:\n\n$$= \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 + 3\\cdot\\sqrt{3}/2 + \\frac{3\\cdot(3/4)}{1 - 3\\cdot(3/4) + 2\\cdot(\\sqrt{3}/2)^3}}}$$\n\nAfter calculating the above expression, the interplanar distance $d_{111}$ is approximately 9.08 Angstrom.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NH0s:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Ho57:\n9.08 Angstrom\n\n### answer by Debate Agent s1As:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xU8Z:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
