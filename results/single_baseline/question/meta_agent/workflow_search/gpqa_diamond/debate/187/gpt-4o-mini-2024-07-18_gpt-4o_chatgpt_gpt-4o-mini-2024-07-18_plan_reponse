        "response": "To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)cos(alpha)), where a is the interatomic distance, h, k, l are the Miller indices, and alpha is the rhombohedral angle. Given a = 10 Angstrom, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1, and alpha = 30 degrees, we substitute these values into the formula. The cosine of 30 degrees is sqrt(3)/2. Substituting these values, we get: d_111 = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6(sqrt(3)/2)) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3sqrt(3)) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3sqrt(3)). Calculating this gives approximately 9.08 Angstrom, which matches choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
