        "response": "The interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal can be calculated using the formula: \\[ d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl) \\cos \\alpha}} \\] where a is the interatomic distance, h, k, l are the Miller indices, and \\( \\alpha \\) is the angle between the axes. For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1, a = 10 Angstrom, and \\( \\alpha = 30^{\\circ} \\). Substituting these values, we calculate: \\[ d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1) \\cos(30^{\\circ})}} \\] \\( \\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\). Simplifying, we find: \\[ d_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 + 3\\cdot\\sqrt{3}/2}} \\] After calculating, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.08 Angstrom. All agents agree on this calculation, and the correct choice is C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
