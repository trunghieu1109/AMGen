Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (É·F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the molecular weight range of substance A4, we analyze the information about the binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. The clues suggest that A4 is significant in the reactions involving Y and fluorine. The interactions with xenon and the formation of A5 indicate that A4 likely has a higher molecular weight. The choices provided suggest that A4's molecular weight is likely on the higher end. After considering the reasoning from various agents, the most plausible range for A4's molecular weight is 220-240, as it aligns with the complexity and interactions described.
