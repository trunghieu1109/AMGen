    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (É·F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.

### thinking by Debate Agent YkxP:
We need to determine the molecular weight range of A4. Let&#39;s analyze the given information: A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon. A3 is formed by fluorination of Y, indicating a higher fluorine content. A4, when reacted with Y, forms A5, which decomposes in water. The decomposition of A5 into two substances suggests it&#39;s a complex fluoride. The molecular weight of A4 must be calculated considering these properties. Given that A4 reacts with Y to form A5, A4 is likely a fluoride of Y. The molecular weight of A4 should be in a range that allows it to form a stable compound with Y. Considering fluorine&#39;s atomic weight and typical compound formation, the molecular weight range of A4 is likely to be between 140-160.

### thinking by Debate Agent NG5Y:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. We know that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon. A3, which also interacts with xenon, is obtained by the fluorination of element Y. A4 is involved in the formation of A5 when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio, and A5 decomposes in water. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine suggests that A2 might be a lower fluoride of Y. The oxidation of xenon suggests that these compounds have strong oxidizing properties, typical of higher fluorides. Since A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, it is likely a simple fluoride of Y. The interaction of A5 with water forming two substances suggests hydrolysis, common in higher fluorides. To find the molecular weight range of A4, we need to consider that A4 is a precursor to A5 and likely a higher fluoride. Given the options, we should consider the molecular weights of plausible candidates for A4 based on known fluorides of elements that can form multiple fluorides with distinct properties. The range 220-240 matches known molecular weights of higher fluorides of some elements, which are consistent with the described properties.

### thinking by Debate Agent KQzF:
We are given a set of binary compounds of fluorine with element Y, and we need to determine the molecular weight range of A4. The problem gives us clues about the decomposition and reactions of these compounds. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating A1 is a strong oxidizer. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and also interacts with xenon, suggesting it is a reactive fluorine compound. The reaction of Y with a hot concentrated solution of A4 to form A5 implies a specific stoichiometry and reactivity pattern. Finally, A5 decomposes in water, hinting at possible hydrolysis. To find the molecular weight range of A4, we need to consider the possible identities and molar masses of these fluorine compounds. Given the typical molecular weights of fluorides and the stoichiometry involved, we can infer that the range 220-240 is too high for a binary fluoride, while 110-130 is too low. The most probable range for A4, considering it is a concentrated solution and its reactions, is 140-160.

### thinking by Debate Agent NZmC:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the element Y and the fluorine compounds. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine indicates A1 is a higher fluoride of Y. The molecular weight of A4 needs to be determined. A5, formed by adding Y to A4, decomposes in water. Let&#39;s consider Y as a common element that forms multiple fluorides, like sulfur (S) or chlorine (Cl). The percentage of fluorine in A2 gives clues about its formula. A2 has 31.96% fluorine, suggesting a compound like SF4 (molar mass = 108 + 4*19 = 188; %F = 76/188 = 40.4%, which is close to the given 31.96% if Y is another element). A4 should be one of the fluorides with a molecular weight in the given ranges. Considering the typical molecular weights of sulfur or chlorine fluorides, A4 could be SF6 (molar mass = 146). Therefore, the range for A4&#39;s molecular weight is likely 140-160.

    <pre>The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. The clues suggest that A4 is a fluoride of Y that reacts with Y to form A5, which decomposes in water. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine, and the oxidation of xenon by A1, suggest that these are higher fluorides. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, indicating it is a simple fluoride. The molecular weight of A4 should be consistent with known fluorides of elements that can form multiple fluorides. The range 140-160 is consistent with the molecular weights of known higher fluorides, such as SF6 (molar mass = 146). Therefore, the most likely range for A4&#39;s molecular weight is 140-160.
