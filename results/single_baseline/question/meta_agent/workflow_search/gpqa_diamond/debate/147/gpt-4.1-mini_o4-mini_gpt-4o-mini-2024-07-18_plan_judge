Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: From A2’s F mass fraction 31.96% we get Y≈121→Sb, so the five fluorides are SbF, SbF2, SbF3, SbF4, SbF5. A1=SbF4 (red, decomposes to SbF3+F2), A2=SbF3, A3=SbF5, hence A4=SbF2 with M≈121.8+2·19=159.8, which lies in 140–160.
