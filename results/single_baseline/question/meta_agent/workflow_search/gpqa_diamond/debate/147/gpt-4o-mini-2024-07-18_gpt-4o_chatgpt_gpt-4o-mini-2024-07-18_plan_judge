Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. The clues suggest that A4 is a fluoride of Y that reacts with Y to form A5, which decomposes in water. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine, and the oxidation of xenon by A1, suggest that these are higher fluorides. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, indicating it is a simple fluoride. The molecular weight of A4 should be consistent with known fluorides of elements that can form multiple fluorides. The range 140-160 is consistent with the molecular weights of known higher fluorides, such as SF6 (molar mass = 146). Therefore, the most likely range for A4's molecular weight is 140-160.
