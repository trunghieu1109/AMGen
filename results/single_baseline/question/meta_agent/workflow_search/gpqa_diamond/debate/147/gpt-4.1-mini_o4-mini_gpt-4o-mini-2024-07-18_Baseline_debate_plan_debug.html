    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;220-240&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;140-160&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;160-180&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;110-130&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent YkxP:
We are told Y has five known binary fluorides A1…A5. A1 is a bright‐red fluoride that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and F2, and A1 also oxidizes Xe. A2 has F mass fraction 31.96 %; solving m·19/(M+m·19)=0.3196 gives M≈121 for m=3 ⇒ A2=YF3 with M(Y)=121 ⇒ Y=Sb. The five Sb fluorides are SbF, SbF2, SbF3, SbF4, SbF5. A1 must be SbF4 (red solid, decomposes to SbF3+F2), A2=SbF3. A3 is obtained by direct fluorination (Sb+F2) and also reacts with Xe ⇒ SbF5. That leaves A4=SbF2 and A5 from Sb+SbF2. Thus A4=SbF2 with MW=121.8+2·19≈159.8, so its MW lies in 140–160.

### thinking by Debate Agent NG5Y:
The only fluoride that oxidizes xenon at room temperature is platinum hexafluoride (PtF6), which decomposes at 293 K to PtF4 + F2.  Thus Y = Pt.  Pt has binary fluorides PtF2, PtF4, PtF6 (plus unstable higher oxidation states) but the only A4 which forms a colorless solution (inHF) and into which Pt metal reduces is PtF2 (M ≈ 195.1 + 2·19 = 233.1).  That lies in range 220–240.

### thinking by Debate Agent KQzF:
Let Y be the element in YFₓ that gives A2 with ω(F)=31.96%. Solving x·19/(M_Y+x·19)=0.3196 for integer x yields x=3 and M_Y≈121.8, i.e. Y=Sb. The five fluorides are SbF, SbF₂, SbF₃, SbF₄, SbF₅. A1 (red) is SbF₄ (disproportionates to SbF₃ + F₂); A2 is SbF₃; A3 (from direct fluorination) is SbF₅; A4 must be SbF₂; A5 then SbF, which hydrolyzes in water. M(SbF₂)=121.76+2·19=159.76, which lies in the 140–160 range.

### thinking by Debate Agent NZmC:
We recognize Y as platinum, since only Pt has five binary fluorides PtF2–PtF6, and PtF6 is the well-known red oxidizer that reacts with Xe, decomposes to PtF5+F2, etc. A4 must be one of these Pt fluorides; by elimination its molar mass falls in the 220–240 range (PtF2 ≈233).

    <pre>From A2’s F mass fraction 31.96% we get Y≈121→Sb, so the five fluorides are SbF, SbF2, SbF3, SbF4, SbF5. A1=SbF4 (red, decomposes to SbF3+F2), A2=SbF3, A3=SbF5, hence A4=SbF2 with M≈121.8+2·19=159.8, which lies in 140–160.
