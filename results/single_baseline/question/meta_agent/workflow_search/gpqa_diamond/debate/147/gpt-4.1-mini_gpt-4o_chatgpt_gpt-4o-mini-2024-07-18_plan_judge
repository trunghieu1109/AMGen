Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (É·F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves identifying compounds of fluorine with an unknown element Y. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, with A2 having a fluorine weight percentage of 31.96%. This percentage can help determine the molecular weight of A2 and, by extension, the identity of Y. A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of Y, suggesting it is a simple fluoride. A4 is a colorless concentrated solution that reacts with Y to form A5, which decomposes in water. The key is to determine the molecular weight range of A4. Given the options, we need to calculate the molecular weight of A4 based on the possible compounds formed by Y. The debate agents provided different answers, but the most consistent reasoning points to the molecular weight range of 160-180, as it aligns with the properties and reactions described.
