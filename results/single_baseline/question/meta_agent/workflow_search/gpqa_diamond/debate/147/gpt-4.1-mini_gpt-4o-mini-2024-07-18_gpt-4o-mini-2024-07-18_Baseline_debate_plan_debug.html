    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (É·F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;220-240&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;140-160&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;160-180&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;110-130&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent YKQz:
To determine the range of the molecular weight of substance A4, we need to analyze the information given about the binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. The clues suggest that A4 is an important intermediate in the reactions involving Y and fluorine. The molecular weights of the choices provided can be evaluated based on the typical molecular weights of known fluorine compounds and their reactivity. Given the context and the behavior of A4 in relation to other substances, the most plausible range for A4&#39;s molecular weight can be inferred.

### thinking by Debate Agent FNZm:
To determine the range of the molecular weight of substance A4, we need to analyze the information given about the compounds and their interactions. The decomposition of A1 at 293 K and its composition suggests it is relatively stable, and the presence of fluorine indicates that it likely contains a heavy element Y. The interactions with xenon and the formation of A5 from A4 suggest that A4 is a significant compound in terms of molecular weight. Given the choices, we can infer that A4 must have a higher molecular weight due to its role in forming multiple products and its stability under heat. The ranges provided suggest that A4&#39;s molecular weight is likely on the higher end. Therefore, the most plausible range for A4&#39;s molecular weight based on the given options is 220-240.

### thinking by Debate Agent Clmc:
To determine the range of the molecular weight of substance A4, we need to analyze the information provided about the compounds involving fluorine and element Y. The decomposition and reactions mentioned suggest that A4 is a significant compound related to the fluorination process. Given the ranges provided, we can deduce that A4 likely has a higher molecular weight due to its involvement in forming other compounds and its reactions with xenon. Analyzing the choices, the range 220-240 seems too high for a binary compound with fluorine, while 110-130 seems too low considering the complexity of the reactions described. Therefore, the most reasonable range for A4&#39;s molecular weight would be 140-160 or 160-180. However, since A5 is formed from A4 and Y in a 1:1 ratio, the molecular weight of A4 should be higher than that of A5. Hence, the most plausible choice is 160-180.

### thinking by Debate Agent hUus:
To determine the molecular weight range of substance A4, we need to analyze the information given about the compounds and their interactions. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, indicating it contains fluorine and possibly another heavier element Y. The molecular weight of A4 can be inferred from its interactions and the compounds formed. Given the choices provided and the context of the problem, we can logically deduce that A4 likely has a higher molecular weight due to its involvement in reactions with heavier elements like xenon and the formation of other compounds. The most reasonable range based on the clues would be 220-240, as it aligns with the complexity and interactions described.
