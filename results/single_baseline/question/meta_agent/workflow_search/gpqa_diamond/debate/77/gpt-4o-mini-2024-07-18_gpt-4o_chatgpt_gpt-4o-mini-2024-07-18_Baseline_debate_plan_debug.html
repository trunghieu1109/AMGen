### thinking by Debate Agent J9dz:
To solve for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) of a moving point charge, we need to consider the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the potentials due to a moving charge. The scalar potential V is given by \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c)} \), and the vector potential \vec{A} is given by \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_o q \vec{v}}{4\pi (d - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}/c)} \). In these expressions, \( d = |\vec{d}| \) represents the distance from the retarded position of the charge to the field point, and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is the dot product of the vector \vec{d} and the velocity \vec{v} of the charge. The correct choice should reflect these potentials, considering the speed of light c. The key is the term \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominators, which accounts for the retardation effect.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5bLy:
To determine the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) for a moving point charge, we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light and the effects of the charge&#39;s motion. The scalar potential V at a field point \vec{r} and time t is given by V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}, where \vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the field point, and \vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The vector potential \vec{A} is given by \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}. Therefore, choice 2 matches the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

### thinking by Debate Agent IRz3:
To determine the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) at time t and position \vec{r}, we need to consider the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. The scalar potential V(\vec{r}, t) is given by \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}, where \vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, and \vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The vector potential \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) is given by \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}. These expressions account for the effects of the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge.

### thinking by Debate Agent 79dZ:
To find the scalar potential V and vector potential \vec{A} at time t and position \vec{r} for a moving point charge, we must use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential V is given by V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}.\vec{v})}, where d is the distance from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, and \vec{d}.\vec{v} is the dot product of the vector \vec{d} and the velocity \vec{v}. The vector potential \vec{A} is given by \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}.\vec{v})}. These expressions account for the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge.

    <pre>The problem involves finding the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, which are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge. The scalar potential V is given by \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is given by \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). These expressions match choice 2, which correctly reflects the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving charge.
