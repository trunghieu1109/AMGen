            "Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.",

        "response": "To determine the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a field point due to a moving point charge, we apply the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials. The correct expressions for these potentials account for the charge's motion and the finite speed of light. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is given by V = q / (4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080( r - (v/c\u00b2)\u00b7d)), and the vector potential A is given by A = (\u03bc\u2080qv) / (4\u03c0(d - (v/c\u00b2)\u00b7d)). Comparing the provided choices, choice 2 matches the correct form of these equations, reflecting the dependence on the distance and the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nAnswer:B",
