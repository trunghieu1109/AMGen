    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t &gt; tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c-&gt;$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono -&gt;$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent J9dz:
The problem involves the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the scalar and vector potentials due to a point charge moving arbitrarily. The scalar potential V and vector potential \vec{A} at a field point \vec{r} and time t due to a point charge q moving along a trajectory \vec{s}(t) are given by: V(\vec{r},t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} and \vec{A}(\vec{r},t) = \frac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}, where \vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, \vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, and d is the magnitude of \vec{d}.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5bLy:
To find the scalar potential V and vector potential \vec{A} for a moving point charge, we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential V for a moving point charge is given by V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}, where \vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the field point and \vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The vector potential \vec{A} is given by \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}. This takes into account the effects of the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge.

### thinking by Debate Agent IRz3:
To solve this, we need to recall the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the scalar and vector potentials for a point charge moving with velocity \(\vec{v}\). The potentials are given by the expressions: \(V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}\) and \(\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}\). These expressions take into account the retardation time and the motion of the charge. The correct choice should match these expressions.

### thinking by Debate Agent 79dZ:
For a moving point charge, the retarded potentials are used to describe the scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V and the vector potential \vec{A} at the field point \vec{r} and time t are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These are expressed as: V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})} and \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}, where d is the distance from the position of the charge at the retarded time to the field point and \vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. This matches with choice 2.
