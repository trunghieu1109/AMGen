The scalar potential V and vector potential \\vec{A} at a field point \\vec{r} and time t due to a point charge q moving along a trajectory \\vec{s}(t) are given by: V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} and \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}, where \\vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, \\vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, and d is the magnitude of \\vec{d}.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5bLy:\nTo find the scalar potential V and vector potential \\vec{A} for a moving point charge, we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The scalar potential V for a moving point charge is given by V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, where \\vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the field point and \\vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The vector potential \\vec{A} is given by \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}. This takes into account the effects of the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent IRz3:\nTo solve this, we need to recall the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the scalar and vector potentials for a point charge moving with velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\). The potentials are given by the expressions: \\(V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\) and \\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\). These expressions take into account the retardation time and the motion of the charge. The correct choice should match these expressions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 79dZ:\nFor a moving point charge, the retarded potentials are used to describe the scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V and the vector potential \\vec{A} at the field point \\vec{r} and time t are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These are expressed as: V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} and \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, where d is the distance from the position of the charge at the retarded time to the field point and \\vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.
