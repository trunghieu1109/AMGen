Multiplying numerator and denominator by c gives\nV=qc/(4πε0(dc−d·v)),  A=μ0qc v/(4π(dc−d·v)),\nwhich exactly matches choice2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent IRz3:\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard–Wiechert potentials are V = qc/[4πε₀ (dc − d·v)] and A = μ₀qc v/[4π (dc − d·v)], which matches choice2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 79dZ:\nThe correct expressions are the Liénard–Wiechert potentials: φ(r,t)=qc/(4πε0 (Rc–R·v)) and A(r,t)=μ0 qc v/(4π (Rc–R·v)). That matches choice 2 with the retarded vector d≡R and denominator (d c–d·v).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent J9dz:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5bLy:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent IRz3:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 79dZ:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
