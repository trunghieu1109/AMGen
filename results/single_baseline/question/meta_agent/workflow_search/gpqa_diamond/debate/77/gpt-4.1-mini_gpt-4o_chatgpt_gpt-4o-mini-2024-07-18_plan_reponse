            "Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.",

        "response": "The problem involves determining the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, which are given by the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge. The correct expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential \\vec{A} are: V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} and \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}. These match with choice 2, which is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:B)",
