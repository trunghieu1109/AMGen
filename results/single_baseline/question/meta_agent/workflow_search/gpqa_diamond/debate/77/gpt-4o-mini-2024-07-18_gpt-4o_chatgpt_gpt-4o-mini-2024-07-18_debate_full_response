The scalar potential V is given by \\( V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\), and the vector potential \\vec{A} is given by \\( \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\). In these expressions, \\( d = |\\vec{d}| \\) represents the distance from the retarded position of the charge to the field point, and \\( \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} \\) is the dot product of the vector \\vec{d} and the velocity \\vec{v} of the charge. The correct choice should reflect these potentials, considering the speed of light c. The key is the term \\( d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} \\) in the denominators, which accounts for the retardation effect.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5bLy:\nTo determine the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) for a moving point charge, we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light and the effects of the charge's motion. The scalar potential V at a field point \\vec{r} and time t is given by V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}, where \\vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the field point, and \\vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The vector potential \\vec{A} is given by \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}.
