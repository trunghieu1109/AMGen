        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm when calculated using the formula \u03bb = 1240 / E. This wavelength is in the green region of the visible spectrum. The complementary color to green is red, which means the dye absorbs red light. Therefore, the correct answer is that the dye absorbs red light.\n\nAnswer:C)",
