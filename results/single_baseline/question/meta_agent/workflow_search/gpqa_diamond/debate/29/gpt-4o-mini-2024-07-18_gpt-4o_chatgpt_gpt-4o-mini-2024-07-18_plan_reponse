        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. To find the wavelength, we use the formula \u03bb = hc/E, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Substituting the values, we find \u03bb \u2248 531 nm, which corresponds to green light. The complementary color of green is red, so the compound absorbs red light.\n\nAnswer:C",
