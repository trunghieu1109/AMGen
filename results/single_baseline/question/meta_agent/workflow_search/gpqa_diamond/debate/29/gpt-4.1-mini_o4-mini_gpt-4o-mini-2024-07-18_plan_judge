Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The emission energy E = 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength λ = 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm, which is green light. In fluorescent dyes, absorption occurs at higher energy (shorter wavelength) than emission. Of the given options, only blue (≈450 nm, ~2.75 eV) and violet (≈400 nm, ~3.1 eV) have energies above 2.3393 eV. Typical Stokes shifts place the absorption in the blue region for a green-emitting dye, so the dye absorbs blue light.
