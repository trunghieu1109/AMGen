Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength in the blue region of the visible spectrum. Since the compound emits light, it absorbs the complementary color of blue, which is yellow. Therefore, the correct answer is that the organic compound absorbs yellow light.

Answer:Yellow
Extracted answer: Yellow
Correct answer: 3
