        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength in the blue region of the visible spectrum. Since the compound emits light, it absorbs the complementary color of blue, which is yellow. Therefore, the correct answer is that the organic compound absorbs yellow light.\n\nAnswer:Yellow",
