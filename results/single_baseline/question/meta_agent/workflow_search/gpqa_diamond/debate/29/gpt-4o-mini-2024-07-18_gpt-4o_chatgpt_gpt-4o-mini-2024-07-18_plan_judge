Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. To find the wavelength, we use the formula λ = hc/E, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Substituting the values, we find λ ≈ 531 nm, which corresponds to green light. The complementary color of green is red, so the compound absorbs red light.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
