        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The emission energy E = 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength \u03bb = 1240 eV\u00b7nm / 2.3393 eV \u2248 530 nm, which is green light. In fluorescent dyes, absorption occurs at higher energy (shorter wavelength) than emission. Of the given options, only blue (\u2248450 nm, ~2.75 eV) and violet (\u2248400 nm, ~3.1 eV) have energies above 2.3393 eV. Typical Stokes shifts place the absorption in the blue region for a green-emitting dye, so the dye absorbs blue light.\n\nAnswer:A)",
