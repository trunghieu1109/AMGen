        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, also known as the Diels-Alder reaction, involves a diene and a dienophile. In this case, 2,5-dimethylthiophene acts as the diene and furan-2,5-dione as the dienophile. The EXO product refers to the stereochemistry where the substituents on the dienophile are oriented away from the newly formed ring system. The EXO product is typically favored due to steric and electronic factors. Analyzing the given choices, the EXO product is likely to have the epoxide linkage, which corresponds to choice 3. This is supported by the majority of the agents' reasoning.\n\nAnswer:C",
