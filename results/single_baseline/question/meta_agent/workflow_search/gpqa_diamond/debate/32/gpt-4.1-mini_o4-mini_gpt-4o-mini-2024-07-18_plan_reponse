        "response": "In the Diels\u2013Alder between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and maleic anhydride (furan-2,5-dione), the thiophene sulfur becomes the shorter bridge (\u201cepithio\u201d), and the two methyl groups (at C4 and C7) adopt the exo orientation (syn to the sulfur bridge) to minimize steric and electronic repulsion with the anhydride. Assigning stereochemistry under these exo conditions gives (3aR,4R,7S,7aS), which corresponds to choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
