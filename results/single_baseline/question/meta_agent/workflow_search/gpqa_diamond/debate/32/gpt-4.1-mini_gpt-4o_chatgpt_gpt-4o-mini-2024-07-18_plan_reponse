        "response": "The [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione will form a bicyclic compound. The EXO product refers to the stereochemistry where the substituents are oriented away from the newly formed ring, minimizing steric hindrance. All agents agree that the correct EXO product is the one with the substituents positioned in this manner. Based on the given choices, the product with the correct EXO stereochemistry is choice C, which is (3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione.\n\nAnswer:C)",
