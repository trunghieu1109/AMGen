Question: {'question': 'You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage.

This indicates point mutations introduced in the V regions during a germinal center reaction. That process is somatic hypermutation.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent bWZT:\nThe question describes delivering tagged rotavirus proteins to mice, identifying proliferating B cells in Peyer patches, and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes. The high variability in these variable regions occurs during the germinal center reaction after antigen exposure and is due to somatic hypermutation. Complement activation doesn’t change antibody gene sequences; class switch recombination changes constant regions, not the variable region; VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not in peripheral proliferating cells.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fKyh:\nThe experiment tracks rotavirus GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins delivered orally, with fluorescence identified in Peyer patches. In Peyer patches (secondary lymphoid organs), activated B cells proliferate in germinal centers and the variable heavy chain gene undergoes high variability via somatic hypermutation to increase antigen affinity. VDJ recombination occurs in the bone marrow during B-cell development, not in response to antigen in Peyer patches, and class switching recombination affects constant regions, not variable region variability, while complement activation is unrelated.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 365G:\nThe experiment delivers GFP-tagged rotavirus capsid proteins to the gut, fluorescent antigen reaches Peyer’s patches and drives B cell proliferation. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes from these proliferating B cells reveals a high rate of point mutations in the V-region, characteristic of affinity maturation in germinal centers. This mechanism is somatic hypermutation.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TKfI:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent bWZT:\nA\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fKyh:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 365G:\nA\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
