Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The scenario describes the isolation of a proliferating cell population from Peyer patches, which are associated with the immune response in the gut. The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests that the B cells are undergoing a process that introduces mutations to increase the diversity of the antibody response. This process is known as somatic hypermutation, which occurs after B cell activation and is critical for affinity maturation of antibodies. Therefore, the correct answer is somatic hypermutation.
