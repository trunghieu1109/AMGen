            "You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?",

        "response": "The scenario describes the delivery of tagged proteins to mice and the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches. This high variability suggests a process that increases diversity in antibody genes. Somatic hypermutation is known for introducing point mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes, leading to high variability. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not involve gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the constant region of antibodies but does not introduce variability in the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development to initially create diversity but is not the process occurring in mature B cells in response to an antigen. All agents agree that the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is consistent with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene. Therefore, the final answer is somatic hypermutation.\n\nAnswer:A)",
