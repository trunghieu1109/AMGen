    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;somatic hypermutation&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;complement activation&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;class switching recombination&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;VDJ recombination&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent TKfI:
The experiment tracks antigen to Peyer patches, isolates proliferating B cells post–antigen exposure, and sequences their variable heavy chain genes showing high variability. This indicates point mutations introduced in the V regions during a germinal center reaction. That process is somatic hypermutation.

### thinking by Debate Agent bWZT:
The question describes delivering tagged rotavirus proteins to mice, identifying proliferating B cells in Peyer patches, and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes. The high variability in these variable regions occurs during the germinal center reaction after antigen exposure and is due to somatic hypermutation. Complement activation doesn’t change antibody gene sequences; class switch recombination changes constant regions, not the variable region; VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not in peripheral proliferating cells.

### thinking by Debate Agent fKyh:
The experiment tracks rotavirus GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins delivered orally, with fluorescence identified in Peyer patches. In Peyer patches (secondary lymphoid organs), activated B cells proliferate in germinal centers and the variable heavy chain gene undergoes high variability via somatic hypermutation to increase antigen affinity. VDJ recombination occurs in the bone marrow during B-cell development, not in response to antigen in Peyer patches, and class switching recombination affects constant regions, not variable region variability, while complement activation is unrelated.

### thinking by Debate Agent 365G:
The experiment delivers GFP-tagged rotavirus capsid proteins to the gut, fluorescent antigen reaches Peyer’s patches and drives B cell proliferation. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes from these proliferating B cells reveals a high rate of point mutations in the V-region, characteristic of affinity maturation in germinal centers. This mechanism is somatic hypermutation.
