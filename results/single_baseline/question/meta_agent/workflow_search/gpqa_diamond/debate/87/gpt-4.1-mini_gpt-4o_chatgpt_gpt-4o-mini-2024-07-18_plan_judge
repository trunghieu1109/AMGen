Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The scenario involves observing high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches after exposure to tagged rotavirus proteins. This high variability suggests a process that increases diversity in antibody production. Somatic hypermutation is known to introduce point mutations in the variable region of antibody genes after antigen exposure, leading to increased variability and affinity maturation. Complement activation and class switching recombination do not directly relate to variability in the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs earlier in B cell development and establishes initial diversity before antigen exposure. Therefore, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.
