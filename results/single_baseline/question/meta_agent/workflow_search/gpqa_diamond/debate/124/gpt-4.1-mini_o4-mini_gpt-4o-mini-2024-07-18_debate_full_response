The ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. Thus E_3=(3+3/2)ħω=9/2 ħω and g_3=(3+1)(3+2)/2=10.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent FyH3:\nThe 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω with N = 0,1,2,… and degeneracy g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2. The third excited state corresponds to N=3 giving E = (3+3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω and degeneracy g = (4·5)/2 = 10, which matches choice A).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent f3Fj:\nFor a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator the energy levels are E_N = (N+3/2)ħω where N = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0,1,2,3,… . The ground state has N=0, the first excited N=1 (E=5/2ħω), second N=2 (E=7/2ħω), third N=3 (E=9/2ħω). The degeneracy g(N) = (N+1)(N+2)/2, so at N=3: g(3) = 4·5/2 = 10.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5mbD:\nFor a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (2n_r + l + 3/2) ħω. The principal quantum number N = 2n_r + l. The ground state corresponds to N = 0. Hence the third excited state has N = 3, giving E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. The degeneracy is (N+1)(N+2)/2 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = 10.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent S9Ww:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FyH3:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent f3Fj:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5mbD:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
