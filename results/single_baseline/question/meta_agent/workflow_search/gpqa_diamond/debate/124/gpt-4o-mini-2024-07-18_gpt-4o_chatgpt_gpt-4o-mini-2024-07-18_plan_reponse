            "Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke\u2019s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?",

        "response": "The problem involves a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for such a system are given by E_n = (n + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9, where n is the principal quantum number. The third excited state corresponds to n = 3, so the energy is E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. The degeneracy of the nth level in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, the degeneracy is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)\u0127\u03c9, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions. This matches choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
