            "Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke\u2019s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?",

        "response": "In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9. For the third excited state, n = 3, so E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy level is determined by the degeneracy formula (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, this results in (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)\u0127\u03c9 and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue.\n\nAnswer:(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10",
