Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The problem describes a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for such a system are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For the third excited state, n = 3. Therefore, the energy is E_3 = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. The degeneracy for n = 3 is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. All agents agree on this calculation, and the correct choice is the one that matches these values.
