Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction involves the opening of the epoxide ring by the organocuprate reagent Me2CuLi. The methyl group from the organocuprate will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is the carbon at position 6 in the given bicyclic structure (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This attack will lead to inversion of configuration at this carbon. The original configuration at carbon 6 is S, so after inversion, it will become R. The other stereocenters remain unchanged. Therefore, the resulting product will have the stereochemistry (1R,2S,4R,5R), which corresponds to choice D.
