Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Me2CuLi opens the epoxide at the less hindered carbon C6 with inversion, yielding an OH at original C1 and a new Me at original C6. Renumbering so OH is at C1 and assigning lowest locants gives substituents at positions 1,2,4,5. The configurations at original C1, C3, C4 (now positions 1,5,4) remain R, and inversion at C6 (now C2) gives R. Thus the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, corresponding to choice C).
