            "When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.

        "response": "The reaction involves the opening of the epoxide ring by the organocuprate reagent, Me2CuLi. The methyl group from the organocuprate will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the given epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the less hindered carbon is likely the one at the 6-position, which is not a bridgehead carbon. The attack will result in an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile (Me group) is added. After the attack, the ring opens to form a cyclohexanol derivative. The stereochemistry of the product will be determined by the inversion at the site of attack. Most agents agree that the correct product is (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
