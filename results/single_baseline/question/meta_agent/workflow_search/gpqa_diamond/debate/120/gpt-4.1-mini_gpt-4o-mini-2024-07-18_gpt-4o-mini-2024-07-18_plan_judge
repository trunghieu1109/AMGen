Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane and Me2CuLi, we analyze the mechanism of epoxide ring opening. The organocuprate reagent (Me2CuLi) will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to inversion of configuration at that carbon. The stereochemistry of the starting material indicates that the attack will occur at a specific site, resulting in a product with a defined stereochemical configuration. After evaluating the provided choices and considering the stereochemical implications of the reaction, the correct product corresponds to the expected outcome of the nucleophilic attack and configuration inversion.

Answer:(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Extracted answer: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Correct answer: 3
