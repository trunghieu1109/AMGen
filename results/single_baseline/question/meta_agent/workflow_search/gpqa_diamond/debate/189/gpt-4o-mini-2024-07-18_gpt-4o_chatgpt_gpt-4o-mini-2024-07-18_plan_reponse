            "The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate",

        "response": "All agents agree on the order of nucleophilicity based on the principles of charge, basicity, and solvation effects in aqueous solution. Negatively charged nucleophiles are generally more reactive than neutral ones, and sulfur-containing nucleophiles are more reactive than oxygen-containing ones due to polarizability. Therefore, the order from most to least reactive is ethanethiolate, hydroxide, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, propionate, and methanol.\n\nAnswer:5, 2, 1, 3 and 4",
