    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 4.4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 33.4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 10.4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 3.2&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
We start with the equilibrium temperature relation: Teq ∝ L⋆1/4a−1/2 (same albedo so L⋆ cancels). Thus T1/T2 = √(a2/a1) ⇒ a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. Similarly T2/T3 = √(a3/a2) ⇒ a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. Hence a3/a1 = 1.96×5.29 ≈ 10.37. By Kepler’s third law (neglecting planet masses relative to the star), P ∝ a3/2, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)3/2 ≈ (10.37)1.5 ≈ 33.4, which corresponds to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
The equilibrium temperature scales as T∝r^(–1/2) for equal albedo and stellar luminosity, so r∝1/T^2. Given T1/T2=1.4 ⇒ r2/r1=(1.4)^2=1.96; T2/T3=2.3 ⇒ r3/r2=(2.3)^2=5.29. Thus r3/r1=1.96×5.29≈10.37. By Kepler’s third law, P∝r^(3/2), so P3/P1=(r3/r1)^(3/2)≈10.37^(1.5)≈33.4.

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
Equilibrium temperature T ∝ a^(–1/2) for same star and albedo. Given T1/T2 = 1.4 → a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96. Given T2/T3 = 2.3 → a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29. Thus a3/a1 = 1.96 × 5.29 = 10.3684. By Kepler’s third law P ∝ a^(3/2) so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) ≈ 10.3684^1.5 ≈ 33.4.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
We have three exoplanets with equilibrium temperature ratios T1/T2≈1.4 and T2/T3≈2.3, so T1/T3=1.4×2.3≈3.22. Equilibrium temperature scales as T_eq∝1/√a for circular orbits with the same stellar flux and albedo, hence a∝1/T_eq². Thus a3/a1=(T1/T3)²≈(3.22)²≈10.36. The orbital period scales as P∝a^{3/2}, so P3/P1=(a3/a1)^{3/2}≈10.36^{1.5}≈33.4. Planetary masses are negligible compared to the stellar mass, so corrections to P due to planet mass are ≪1%. Therefore the factor is ≈33.4, corresponding to choice 2.
