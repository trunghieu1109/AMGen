Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we apply Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit: T^2 ‚àù a^3. The equilibrium temperatures provide a way to relate the semi-major axes of the planets. Given the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures (1.4 between Planet1 and Planet2, and 2.3 between Planet2 and Planet3), we can derive the ratios of the semi-major axes. After calculating the ratios and applying them to find the ratio of the periods, we find that the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 10.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This conclusion is supported by multiple analyses, confirming that the correct answer is ~ 10.4.

Answer:~ 10.4
