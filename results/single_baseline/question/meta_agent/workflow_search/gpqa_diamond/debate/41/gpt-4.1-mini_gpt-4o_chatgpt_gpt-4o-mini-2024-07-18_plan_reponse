            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "response": "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we need to use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and distance from the star, and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = 1.4 implies that the distance ratio d2/d1 = (1/1.4)^2. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3 implies that d3/d2 = (1/2.3)^2. Therefore, the total distance ratio d3/d1 = (d3/d2) * (d2/d1) = (1/1.4)^2 * (1/2.3)^2. Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period ratio P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2). Calculating this gives P3/P1 \u2248 33.4. Thus, the correct answer is choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
