            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "response": "The problem involves calculating the ratio of orbital periods using the equilibrium temperature ratios and Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio between planets is related to their distance from the star. For Planet1 and Planet2, T1/T2 = 1.4 implies (d2/d1)^(1/2) = 1.4, so d2/d1 = 1.4^2 = 1.96. For Planet2 and Planet3, T2/T3 = 2.3 implies (d3/d2)^(1/2) = 2.3, so d3/d2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29. Therefore, d3/d1 = d3/d2 * d2/d1 = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684. According to Kepler's third law, P^2 \u221d d^3, so (P3/P1)^2 = (d3/d1)^3. Therefore, P3/P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2). Calculating this gives P3/P1 \u2248 33.4. Thus, the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately 33.4.\n\nAnswer:B)",
