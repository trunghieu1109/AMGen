Assumption (3) about nonrelativistic quarks is not required. Thus the needed set is 1,2,4, corresponding to choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YkWQ:\nThe impulse approximation assumes the probe interacts with a single nucleon (statement 1), that there are no final‐state interactions or medium effects from the rest of the nucleus (statement 2), and that the struck nucleon behaves as if unbound (statement 4). The internal quark dynamics (statement 3) need not be nonrelativistic for the impulse approximation to hold at the nucleon level. Therefore the required assumptions are 1, 2, and 4, corresponding to choice D.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ke5L:\nThe impulse approximation assumes that the probe interacts with one nucleon as if it were free, with no influence from other nucleons or binding. Assumption 1 ensures the current couples only to individual nucleons. Assumption 2 ensures no final-state interactions with the rest of the nucleus (transparency). Assumption 4 ensures the selected nucleon behaves as if unbound. Assumption 3 (non-relativistic quarks inside the nucleon) is not required for the impulse approximation of nucleon behavior. Therefore the needed assumptions are 1, 2, and 4, corresponding to choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MCjL:\nThe impulse approximation treats the interaction as occurring on a single free nucleon, so we need: (1) only one-body currents, (2) no FSI/other nucleons (transparency), and (4) neglect binding on that nucleon. The nonrelativistic quark assumption (3) is not required. Hence 1,2,4.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 0Ypb:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YkWQ:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ke5L:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MCjL:\nD\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
