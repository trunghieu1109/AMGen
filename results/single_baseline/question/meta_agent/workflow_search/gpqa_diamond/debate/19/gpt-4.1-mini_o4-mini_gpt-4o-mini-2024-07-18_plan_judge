Question: Example(question='A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?\n\n1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.', choice1='2,3,4', choice2='1,3,4', choice3='1,2,3', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The impulse approximation assumes a one-body current (only the struck nucleon interacts), no final-state or medium effects from the rest of the nucleus (transparency), and that the struck nucleon behaves as if unbound (no binding forces). The quark nonrelativistic assumption is not required.
