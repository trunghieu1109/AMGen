        "response": "trans\u2010Cinnamaldehyde has 9 C (C6H5\u2013CH=CH\u2013CHO). Grignard adds Me to give Ph\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH(OH)\u2013CH3 (10 C). PCC oxidation yields Ph\u2013CH=CH\u2013CO\u2013CH3 (still 10 C). Treatment with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Corey\u2013Chaykovsky reagent) on an enone gives cyclopropanation across the C=C, adding one CH2 unit. Total C = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nAnswer:C)",
