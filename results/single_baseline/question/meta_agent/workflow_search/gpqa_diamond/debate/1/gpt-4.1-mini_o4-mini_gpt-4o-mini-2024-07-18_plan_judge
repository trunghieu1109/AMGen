Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: trans‐Cinnamaldehyde has 9 C (C6H5–CH=CH–CHO). Grignard adds Me to give Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–CH3 (10 C). PCC oxidation yields Ph–CH=CH–CO–CH3 (still 10 C). Treatment with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Corey–Chaykovsky reagent) on an enone gives cyclopropanation across the C=C, adding one CH2 unit. Total C = 10 + 1 = 11.
