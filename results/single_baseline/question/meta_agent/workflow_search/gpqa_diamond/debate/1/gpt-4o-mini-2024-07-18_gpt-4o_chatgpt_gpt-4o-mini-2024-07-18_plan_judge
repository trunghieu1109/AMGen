Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Trans-cinnamaldehyde has 9 carbon atoms. When treated with methylmagnesium bromide, a methyl group is added to the carbonyl carbon, forming a secondary alcohol with 10 carbon atoms (Product 1). Oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate converts the alcohol to a ketone, maintaining the carbon count at 10 (Product 2). The reaction with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO is a Wittig-like reaction that typically does not change the number of carbon atoms, so Product 3 also has 10 carbon atoms.
