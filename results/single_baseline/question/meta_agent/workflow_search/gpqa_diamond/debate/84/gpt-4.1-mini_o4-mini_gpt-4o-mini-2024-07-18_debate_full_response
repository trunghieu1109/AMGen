Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent SfEn', content='To find the equilibrium temperature ratio, note that for planets with the same albedo orbiting the same star, Teq∝a^(–1/2). We estimate the orbital semi‐major axes from the measured Doppler shifts Δλ via K=cΔλ/λ, giving K1≈(3×10^5\u2009km/s)(0.03/6300)≈1.43\u2009km/s and K2≈1.90\u2009km/s. For circular orbits around the same star, K∝Mp/a^(1/2), so a2/a1=(K1·M2/(K2·M1))^2. Then T1/T2=(a2/a1)^(1/2)=K1·M2/(K2·M1)=(1.43×5)/(1.90×7)≈0.54.

Equilibrium temperature T_eq ∝ L_star^{1/4} a^{-1/2}. For same star, T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^{1/2}. Using radial-velocity semi-amplitudes K and planet masses Mp, we have for circular orbits K ∝ Mp P^{-1/3} (neglecting Mp vs M_*), and a ∝ P^{2/3}. Thus T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^{1/2} = (P2/P1)^{1/3}. From K ∝ Mp/P^{1/3}, we get P ∝ (Mp/K)^3, hence P2/P1 = (M2 K1 / (M1 K2))^3. Taking cube root for T1/T2 gives T1/T2 = M2 K1 / (M1 K2). Plugging M1=7, M2=5 (Earth masses), and K1 ∝ Δλ1/λ c = (0.03/6300)c ≈1.43 km/s, K2 ≈1.90 km/s, yields T1/T2 ≈(5*1.43)/(7*1.90)≈0.54. Thus the closest choice is ~0.53.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tiVI:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by Teq∝Teff*(R⋆/(2a))1/2*(1−A)1/4. With equal albedo A, the ratio T1/T2=√(a2/a1). We estimate the semi‐major axes from the stellar radial‐velocity amplitudes K≈cΔλ/λ and the relation K=v⋆=vp·(Mp/M⋆)=√(GM⋆/a)·(Mp/M⋆). Solving for a gives a∝M_p^2/K^2. Thus a1/a2=(M1/M2)^2*(K2/K1)^2 with M1=7M⊕, M2=5M⊕, K1=(3×10^5\u2009km/s)(0.03/6300)≈1.43\u2009km/s, K2≈(3×10^5)(0.04/6300)≈1.90\u2009km/s. So a1/a2=(7/5)^2*(1.90/1.43)^2≈3.48, hence T1/T2=√(1/3.48)≈0.536∼0.53.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent HSh5:\nFirst, convert the measured wavelength shifts Δλ to stellar RV amplitudes K via v = c·Δλ/λ: K1≈(3×10^5\u2009km/s)·(0.03/6300)≈1.43\u2009km/s, K2≈1.90\u2009km/s. The RV semi‐amplitude scales as K∝Mp/(M⋆^1/2 a^1/2). For the same star, K∝Mp/a^1/2. Hence a2/a1=(K1M2/(K2M1))^2. The equilibrium temperature T_eq∝a^–1/2, so T1/T2=(a2/a1)^1/2=K1M2/(K2M1)≈(1.43×5)/(1.90×7)≈0.54.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent DQLL:\nFirst, convert the wavelength shifts into orbital velocity semi-amplitudes: Δλ/λ·c gives K1≈(0.03/6300)·3×10^5\u2009km/s≈1.43\u2009km/s and K2≈(0.04/6300)·3×10^5\u2009km/s≈1.90\u2009km/s. For circular orbits, K∝Mp\u2009P^(−1/3) (with same sin\u2009i and M⋆), so K1/K2=(M1/M2)(P2/P1)^(1/3). Plugging M1/M2=7/5=1.4 and K1/K2≈1.43/1.90≈0.753 gives (P2/P1)^(1/3)≈(K1/K2)/(M1/M2)≈0.753/1.4≈0.538 ⇒ P2/P1≈0.538^3≈0.155. Equilibrium temperature T_eq∝a^(−1/2)∝P^(−1/3), so T1/T2=(P2/P1)^(1/3)≈0.155^(1/3)≈0.53.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6ouN:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tiVI:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent HSh5:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DQLL:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
