Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their semi-major axes. The semi-major axis can be inferred from the radial velocity shifts they induce. The radial velocity shift is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be found from the ratio of the radial velocity shifts and the masses. The radial velocity shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The masses are 7 Earth masses for Planet1 and 5 Earth masses for Planet2. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is then (a2 / a1)^0.5. Solving this gives the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tiVI:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * d))^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), where d is the distance of the planet from the star. Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, we can simplify the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) to (d2 / d1)^(1/2). The distance d can be related to the radial velocity shift (Δλ) using the relationship Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the orbital velocity and c is the speed of light. The orbital velocity v is given by v = (G * M_star / d)^(1/2) for circular orbits. By equating the gravitational force to the centripetal force, we can find d1 and d2 from the respective Δλ values. We have Δλ1 = 0.03 Å and Δλ2 = 0.04 Å. Using the formula v = (c * Δλ) / λ, we can find v1 and v2, and subsequently d1 and d2. The ratio of d2/d1 is inversely proportional to the square of the velocity ratio (v1/v2). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is proportional to (v1/v2)^(1/2).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent HSh5:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we need to consider the equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25, where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is determined by the ratio of their semi-major axes: (a1 / a2)^(-0.5). The semi-major axis can be inferred from the Doppler shift caused by each planet. Given that the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star induced by the planet, which depends on the planet's mass and distance from the star, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts (0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2) to infer the ratio of the semi-major axes. Since the shifts are inversely proportional to the semi-major axes, (a1 / a2) = (0.04 / 0.03). Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is (0.03 / 0.04)^(-0.5).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent DQLL:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between the two planets, we need to use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which is given by: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * d))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25, where T_star is the effective temperature of the star, R_star is the radius of the star, d is the distance from the star to the planet, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their distances from the star. The distance can be derived from the Doppler shift induced by each planet. The Doppler shift is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the square root of the distance to the star. The shifts given are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So, the ratio of the distances (d1/d2) can be found using (m1/d1^0.5) / (m2/d2^0.5) = 0.03/0.04. Solving for the distance ratio, we get (m1/m2) * (d2/d1)^0.5 = 0.03/0.04. Substituting m1 = 7 Earth masses and m2 = 5 Earth masses, we find the ratio of distances and then use it to find the temperature ratio. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures will be the inverse of the square root of the distance ratio, as T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of distance.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6ouN:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tiVI:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent HSh5:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DQLL:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
