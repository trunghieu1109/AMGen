            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25. Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their semi-major axes. The semi-major axis can be inferred from the radial velocity shifts they induce. The radial velocity shift is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. The radial velocity shift is 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2. The masses are 7 Earth masses for Planet1 and 5 Earth masses for Planet2. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is then (a2 / a1)^0.5. Solving this gives the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures. All agents agree that the correct choice is A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
