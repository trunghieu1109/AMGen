Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which is given by T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * d))^0.5. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, T_star and R_star are constant for both. The distance d is related to the mass and radius of the planets, but since we are looking for a ratio, we can simplify our calculations. The equilibrium temperature is also affected by the albedo, but since both planets have the same albedo, it cancels out in the ratio. Therefore, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (R_star / (2 * d1))^0.5 / (R_star / (2 * d2))^0.5 = (d2 / d1)^0.5. Given the choices provided, the closest estimate for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is ~ 1.05, which is supported by multiple analyses. Thus, the final answer is A.
