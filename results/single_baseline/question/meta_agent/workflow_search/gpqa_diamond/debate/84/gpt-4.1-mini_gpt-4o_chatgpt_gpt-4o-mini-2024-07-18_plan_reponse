            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we need to consider the relationship between the semi-major axis and the Doppler shift. The equilibrium temperature T_eq of a planet is proportional to (1/a)^0.5, where a is the semi-major axis. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity amplitude, which is proportional to (M_planet / a^0.5). Given the Doppler shifts of 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the relation (a2 / a1)^0.5 = (0.03 / 0.04). Solving this gives a2 / a1 = (0.03 / 0.04)^2. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is then (a2 / a1)^-0.5, which simplifies to (0.04 / 0.03). Calculating this gives approximately 1.3. Therefore, the correct choice is D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
