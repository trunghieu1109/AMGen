Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the equilibrium temperature ratio, note that for planets with the same albedo orbiting the same star, Teq∝a^(–1/2). We estimate the orbital semi‐major axes from the measured Doppler shifts Δλ via K=cΔλ/λ, giving K1≈(3×10^5 km/s)(0.03/6300)≈1.43 km/s and K2≈1.90 km/s. For circular orbits around the same star, K∝Mp/a^(1/2), so a2/a1=(K1·M2/(K2·M1))^2. Then T1/T2=(a2/a1)^(1/2)=K1·M2/(K2·M1)=(1.43×5)/(1.90×7)≈0.54. The closest provided choice is ~0.53.
