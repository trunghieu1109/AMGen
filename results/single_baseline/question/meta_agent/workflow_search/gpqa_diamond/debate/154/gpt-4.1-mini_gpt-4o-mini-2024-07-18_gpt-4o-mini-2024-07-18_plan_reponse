            "Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$",

        "response": "To find the uncertainty \\Delta P_z of the operator P_z, we need to calculate the expectation value \\langle P_z \\rangle and the expectation value of the square \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle. The uncertainty is given by the formula \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2). The matrix for P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues \\hbar, 0, and -\\hbar. We compute the probabilities for these eigenstates from the square of the components of the state vector. The probabilities are: for \\hbar (first component) = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, for 0 (second component) = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2, and for -\\hbar (third component) = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Thus, \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar(1/4) + 0(1/2) + (-\\hbar)(1/4) = 0. For \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle, we have \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2(1/4) + 0(1/2) + \\hbar^2(1/4) = \\hbar^2/2. Therefore, \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2 - 0^2} = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}. The correct answer is \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}.\n\nAnswer:C",
