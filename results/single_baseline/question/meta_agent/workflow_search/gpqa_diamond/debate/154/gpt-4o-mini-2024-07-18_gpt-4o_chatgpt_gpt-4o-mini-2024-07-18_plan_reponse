            "Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$",

        "response": "To find the uncertainty \\( \\Delta P_z \\), we need to calculate \\( \\langle P_z \\rangle \\) and \\( \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle \\) using the given state vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The matrix form of \\( P_z \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\). First, calculate \\( \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle \\). Then calculate \\( \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle \\). The uncertainty is given by \\( \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} \\). After performing these calculations, we find that \\( \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar/2 \\) and \\( \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/2 \\). Therefore, \\( \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2 - (\\hbar/2)^2} = \\hbar/2 \\).\n\nAnswer:B)",
