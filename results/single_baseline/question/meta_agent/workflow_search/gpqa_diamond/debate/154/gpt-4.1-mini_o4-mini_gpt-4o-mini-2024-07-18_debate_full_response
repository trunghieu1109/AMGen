Norm: |c1|^2+|c2|^2+|c3|^2=1/4+1/2+1/4=1. ⟨Pz⟩=∑|ci|^2 pz(i)=(1/4)ħ+(1/2)·0+(1/4)(–ħ)=0. ⟨Pz^2⟩=∑|ci|^2 pz(i)^2=(1/4)ħ^2+0+(1/4)ħ^2=(1/2)ħ^2. Thus ΔPz=√(⟨Pz^2⟩–⟨Pz⟩^2)=ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 784J:\nWe have a spin-1 system with P_z eigenvalues ħ,0,−ħ. The state vector for P_x eigenvalue −ħ is ψ=(−1/2,1/√2,−1/2). Compute ⟨P_z⟩=|c1|^2ħ+|c2|^2·0+|c3|^2(−ħ)=(1/4−1/4)ħ=0. Compute ⟨P_z^2⟩=|c1|^2ħ^2+|c3|^2ħ^2=(1/4+1/4)ħ^2=ħ^2/2. Then ΔP_z=√(⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2)=√(ħ^2/2)=ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zTGo:\nWe have the state ψ in the Pz basis as (ψ1,ψ2,ψ3)=(-1/2,1/√2,-1/2). The Pz operator is diag(ħ,0,−ħ). Compute ⟨Pz⟩=Σ|ψi|^2·(eigenvalue)i=(1/4)·ħ+ (1/2)·0+(1/4)(−ħ)=0. Next ⟨Pz^2⟩=Σ|ψi|^2·(eigenvalue)^2_i=(1/4)ħ^2+0+(1/4)ħ^2=ħ^2/2. Thus variance=(ħ^2/2)−0=ħ^2/2, so ΔPz=ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent WkO6:\nThe state is ψ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in the P_z basis with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. Norm check: 1/4+1/2+1/4=1. Expectation ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)(-ħ)=0. Expectation ⟨P_z^2⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = 1/2 ħ^2. Thus ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) = ħ/√2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent sg66:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 784J:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zTGo:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent WkO6:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
