    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent sg66:
The state is |ψ⟩ = (c1,c2,c3) = (–1/2,1/√2,–1/2) in the Pz basis with eigenvalues ħ,0,–ħ. Norm: |c1|^2+|c2|^2+|c3|^2=1/4+1/2+1/4=1. ⟨Pz⟩=∑|ci|^2 pz(i)=(1/4)ħ+(1/2)·0+(1/4)(–ħ)=0. ⟨Pz^2⟩=∑|ci|^2 pz(i)^2=(1/4)ħ^2+0+(1/4)ħ^2=(1/2)ħ^2. Thus ΔPz=√(⟨Pz^2⟩–⟨Pz⟩^2)=ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 784J:
We have a spin-1 system with P_z eigenvalues ħ,0,−ħ. The state vector for P_x eigenvalue −ħ is ψ=(−1/2,1/√2,−1/2). Compute ⟨P_z⟩=|c1|^2ħ+|c2|^2·0+|c3|^2(−ħ)=(1/4−1/4)ħ=0. Compute ⟨P_z^2⟩=|c1|^2ħ^2+|c3|^2ħ^2=(1/4+1/4)ħ^2=ħ^2/2. Then ΔP_z=√(⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2)=√(ħ^2/2)=ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent zTGo:
We have the state ψ in the Pz basis as (ψ1,ψ2,ψ3)=(-1/2,1/√2,-1/2). The Pz operator is diag(ħ,0,−ħ). Compute ⟨Pz⟩=Σ|ψi|^2·(eigenvalue)i=(1/4)·ħ+ (1/2)·0+(1/4)(−ħ)=0. Next ⟨Pz^2⟩=Σ|ψi|^2·(eigenvalue)^2_i=(1/4)ħ^2+0+(1/4)ħ^2=ħ^2/2. Thus variance=(ħ^2/2)−0=ħ^2/2, so ΔPz=ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent WkO6:
The state is ψ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in the P_z basis with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. Norm check: 1/4+1/2+1/4=1. Expectation ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)(-ħ)=0. Expectation ⟨P_z^2⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 + (1/2)·0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = 1/2 ħ^2. Thus ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) = ħ/√2.
