            "Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words \"size estimate\" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?",

        "response": "The expression provided includes the term 'alpha^3', which is commonly associated with three loops in quantum field theory. Each power of alpha typically corresponds to a loop in perturbation theory. Additionally, the presence of other factors like g^2 and the prefactor of 1/(4pi)^6 suggests further complexity, but the dominant term indicating the number of loops is 'alpha^3'. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Feynman diagram contains 3 loops.\n\nAnswer:A",
