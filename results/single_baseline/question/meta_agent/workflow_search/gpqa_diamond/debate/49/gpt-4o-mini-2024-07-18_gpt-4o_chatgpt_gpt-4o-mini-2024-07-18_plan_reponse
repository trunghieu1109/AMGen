            "Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words \"size estimate\" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?",

        "response": "The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is often related to the powers of coupling constants and factors of 1/(4pi). Each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2. The factor 1/(4pi)^6 suggests that there are 3 loops, as (1/(4pi)^2)^3 = 1/(4pi)^6. Therefore, the diagram likely contained 3 loops.\n\nAnswer:A)",
