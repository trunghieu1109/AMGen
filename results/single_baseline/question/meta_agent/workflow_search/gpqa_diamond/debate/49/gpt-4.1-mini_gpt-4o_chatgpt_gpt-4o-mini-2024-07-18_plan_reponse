            "Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words \"size estimate\" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?",

        "response": "The expression provided includes a factor of (1/(4pi)^6), which is indicative of the number of loops in a Feynman diagram. In four-dimensional spacetime, each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 due to the integration over loop momenta. Therefore, the factor (1/(4pi)^6) suggests that there are 3 loops in the diagram, as (1/(4pi)^2)^3 = 1/(4pi)^6. All agents agree on this interpretation, and the correct choice is the one corresponding to 3 loops.\n\nAnswer:A)",
