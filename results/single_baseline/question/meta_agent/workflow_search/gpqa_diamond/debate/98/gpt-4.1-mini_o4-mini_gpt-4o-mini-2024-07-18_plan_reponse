            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH",

        "response": "The broad IR peak at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 and the strong C=O at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicate a carboxylic acid. In the \u00b9H NMR, one methine appears as a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupling to 1 H, 2 H, and 3 H) and the other as a doublet of triplets of triplets (coupling to 1 H and two sets of 2 H). A dtq pattern arises when a CH is adjacent to one CH (1H), one CH\u2082 (2H), and one CH\u2083 (3H), while a dtt arises when a CH is adjacent to one CH (1H) and two CH\u2082 groups (2H each). Only the 2,3-diethylbutanoic acid structure, CH\u2083C(H)(C\u2082H\u2085)C(H)(C\u2082H\u2085)CH\u2082COOH (choice3), fits these coupling patterns.\n\nAnswer:C)",
