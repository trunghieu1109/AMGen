Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an -OH group due to the broad absorption at around 3000 cm-1, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids. The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm-1 suggests the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group, also typical of carboxylic acids. The absence of vinyl-hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum suggests that the compound does not have double bonds. The complex splitting patterns (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets) indicate that there are multiple neighboring hydrogen atoms affecting the splitting. Evaluating the choices, the compound that fits the characteristics of a carboxylic acid with the specified splitting patterns is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, which has both ethyl and isopropyl groups that could lead to such complex splitting.

Answer:CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Extracted answer: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Correct answer: 3
