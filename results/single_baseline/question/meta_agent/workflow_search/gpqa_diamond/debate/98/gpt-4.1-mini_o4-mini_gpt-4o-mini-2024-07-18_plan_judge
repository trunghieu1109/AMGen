Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The broad IR peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ and the strong C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicate a carboxylic acid. In the ¹H NMR, one methine appears as a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupling to 1 H, 2 H, and 3 H) and the other as a doublet of triplets of triplets (coupling to 1 H and two sets of 2 H). A dtq pattern arises when a CH is adjacent to one CH (1H), one CH₂ (2H), and one CH₃ (3H), while a dtt arises when a CH is adjacent to one CH (1H) and two CH₂ groups (2H each). Only the 2,3-diethylbutanoic acid structure, CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (choice3), fits these coupling patterns.
