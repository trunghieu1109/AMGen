Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid due to the broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1 (O-H stretch) and the strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1 (C=O stretch). The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns, such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, which suggest a complex coupling environment. The absence of vinyl hydrogens rules out unsaturated compounds. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH has chiral centers and methyl groups that can lead to such complex splitting patterns in the NMR, making it a likely candidate. The presence of ethyl groups in other options would lead to different splitting patterns. Therefore, the compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH fits the description best.
