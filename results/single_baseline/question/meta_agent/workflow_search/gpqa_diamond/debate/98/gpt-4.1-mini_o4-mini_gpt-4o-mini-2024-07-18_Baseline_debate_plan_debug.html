    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent aiLV:
The broad 3000 cm⁻¹ and strong 1700 cm⁻¹ IR absorptions indicate a carboxylic acid. In the 1H NMR, one CH appears as a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupling to 1 H, 2 H, and 3 H) and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets (coupling to 1 H and two sets of 2 H). Mapping vicinal couplings shows that only a skeleton with two CH’s each bearing an ethyl substituent (so each CH couples to one neighboring CH, to its ethyl CH₂, and for one CH to the main‐chain CH₂ or to its ethyl CH₃) can give dtq and dtt patterns. That corresponds uniquely to CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH, choice C.

### thinking by Debate Agent iNjV:
The IR shows a carboxylic acid (broad OH at 3000 cm⁻¹, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹).  Two diastereotopic CH signals in the ¹H NMR exhibit a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).  A dtq arises when a CH couples to 1H (doublet), 2H (triplet) and 3H (quartet): that is a CH bearing one ethyl and one methyl substituent.  A dtt arises when a CH couples to three distinct sets of 2H each (triplets) and to 1H (doublet): that is a CH bearing two ethyl substituents.  Only CH3–CH(C2H5)–CH(C2H5)–CH2–COOH (choice3) has one CH with Et+Me (dtq) and one CH with Et+Et (dtt).

### thinking by Debate Agent YMer:
The broad 3000 cm⁻¹ peak and 1700 cm⁻¹ peak show a carboxylic acid. 1H NMR shows one methine as dtq (coupling to 1 H, 2 H, 3 H) and another as dtt (coupling to 1 H, 2 H, 2 H). Only the 2,3-diethylbutanoic acid (choice3: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH) has one CH that couples to a CH (1 H), a CH2 (2 H) and a CH3 (3 H) giving dtq, and the other CH coupling to a CH (1 H) and two CH2’s (2 H each) giving dtt.

### thinking by Debate Agent qDWJ:
The IR shows a carboxylic acid (broad ~3000 cm⁻¹, C=O ~1700 cm⁻¹). ¹H NMR has no vinyl H.  We need one CH giving a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and another giving a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).  In CH3C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH, the first CH is adjacent to one CH, one CH2 and one CH3 (dtq) and the second CH is adjacent to one CH and two CH2 groups (dtt).  The others cannot give both dtq and dtt patterns.
