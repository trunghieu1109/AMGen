Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid due to the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 (C=O stretch). The 1H NMR spectrum lacks vinyl hydrogen signals, ruling out unsaturated compounds. The complex splitting patterns in the 1H NMR, such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, suggest a complex proton environment with multiple chiral centers. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH has the necessary structural complexity and chiral centers to produce such NMR patterns, as it contains both ethyl and methyl groups that can lead to the observed splitting. Therefore, the most likely compound is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.
