Question: Example(question='Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:', choice1='Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice2='Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice3='Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice4='Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Transit probability scales as R_star/a. Both stars have the same radius, so the ratio P_t1/P_t2 = a2/a1. From Kepler’s third law, a ∝ M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3). Here M1 = 2M2 and P2 = 3P1, giving a2/a1 = 3^(2/3)/(2^(1/3)) ≃ 1.65. Therefore Planet_1 has ≃1.65× higher transit probability.
