For system_1, K_1 = 10 km/s and K_2 = 5 km/s, and P = 2 years. For system_2, K_1 = 15 km/s and K_2 = 10 km/s, and P = 1 year. We can calculate the total mass for both systems and find the ratio of system_1's mass to system_2's mass.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fxqv:\nTo find the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we can use the relationship between the period of the system and the masses of the stars. The mass of a binary star system can be estimated using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the total mass (M) of the system. The formula can be expressed as P^2 = (4π^2/GM) a^3, where G is the gravitational constant. However, we can also use the radial velocity amplitudes to relate the masses of the stars in each system. The mass function can be derived from the radial velocity amplitudes, which gives us a way to compare the two systems. The mass ratio can be approximated by the ratio of the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations and the periods of the systems. Given that system_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and system_2 has amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s, we can determine the mass ratios based on these values. After calculating, we find that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times more massive than system_2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MQUn:\nTo determine the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2, we can apply Kepler's laws and the concept of mass function for binary star systems. The mass function can be expressed as: f(M) = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G), where P is the period, K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes, and G is the gravitational constant. We will calculate the mass function for both systems and then find the ratio of their masses. Given the radial velocity amplitudes and periods, we can infer the mass of each system based on the observed parameters. The calculations show that system_1 has a lower combined mass compared to system_2, leading to the conclusion that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times the mass of system_2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent l8CD:\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the relationship between the orbital period of the binary system and the masses of the stars. The mass ratio can be inferred from the radial velocity amplitudes and the periods of the systems. Using Kepler's third law and the relationship between the radial velocity amplitudes and the masses of the stars, we can set up a comparison. The total mass of a binary system is related to the amplitudes of the stars' radial velocities and the period of their orbit. By calculating the mass for both systems based on the given data, we can find the ratio of their masses. After performing the necessary calculations, the mass ratio indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times the mass of system_2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent LLsv:\nC) ~ 0.6\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fxqv:\n~ 0.6\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MQUn:\n~ 0.6\n\n### answer by Debate Agent l8CD:\n~ 0.6\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
