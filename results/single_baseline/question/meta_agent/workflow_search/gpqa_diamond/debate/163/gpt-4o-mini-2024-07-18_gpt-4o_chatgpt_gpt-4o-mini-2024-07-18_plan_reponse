            "Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.",

        "response": "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to compare the mass functions of the two systems. The mass function is proportional to the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes divided by the period. For system_1, the period is 2 years and the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a mass function proportional to (15^3) / 2. For system_2, the period is 1 year and the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a mass function proportional to (25^3) / 1. Calculating these gives 3375/2 for system_1 and 15625 for system_2. The ratio of these mass functions is (3375/2) / 15625 = 0.108. This means system_1 is approximately 0.108 times as massive as system_2, or system_2 is more massive. The closest choice to this ratio is ~0.4, which represents the inverse sense of system_1 being less massive.\n\nAnswer:A)",
