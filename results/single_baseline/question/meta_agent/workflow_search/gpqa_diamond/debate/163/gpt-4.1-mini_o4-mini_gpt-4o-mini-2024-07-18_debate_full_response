For edge‐on (sin i=1) and in ratio form, constants cancel: M1/M2 = (P1/P2)*[(K1_1+K2_1)/(K1_2+K2_2)]^3. Here P1=2\u2009yr, P2=1\u2009yr → P1/P2=2; K_sum1=10+5=15\u2009km/s; K_sum2=15+10=25\u2009km/s → ratio=15/25=0.6; cubed=0.216; ×2=0.432 ≈0.4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent BDuV:\nWe have two eclipsing binaries with edge-on circular orbits. The total mass of a binary M_tot = (P (K1+K2)^3)/(2πG) (with sin\u2009i≈1). Thus the mass ratio is\nM1_tot/M2_tot = (P1/P2)·[(K1_1+K2_1)/(K1_2+K2_2)]^3.\nHere P1/P2 = 2/1 = 2, (K1_1+K2_1) = 10+5 = 15 km/s, (K1_2+K2_2) = 15+10 = 25 km/s, so their ratio 15/25 = 0.6, cubed = 0.216. Then multiplied by 2 gives ≃0.432 ≃0.4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent JLLs:\nWe have two eclipsing binaries with edge-on orbits, so the total mass M_tot = P (K1+K2)^3/(2πG). Taking the ratio M1_tot/M2_tot = [P1 (K1_1+K2_1)^3]/[P2 (K1_2+K2_2)^3]. For system_1: P1=2 yr, K1+K2=10+5=15 km/s; for system_2: P2=1 yr, K1+K2=15+10=25 km/s. Thus ratio = 2*(15)^3/(1*(25)^3)=2*3375/15625=6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vfxq:\nFor each eclipsing binary (edge‐on, circular), total mass M∝P*(K₁+K₂)³ (from a₁=P·K₁/2π, a₂=P·K₂/2π, Kepler’s law). System 1: P₁=2 yr, K₁+K₂=10+5=15 km/s → M₁∝2×15³=2×3375=6750. System 2: P₂=1 yr, K₁+K₂=15+10=25 km/s → M₂∝1×25³=15625.
