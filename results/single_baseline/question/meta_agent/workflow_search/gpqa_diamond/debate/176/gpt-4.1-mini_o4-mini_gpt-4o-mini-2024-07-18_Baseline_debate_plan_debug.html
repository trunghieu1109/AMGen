    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 1gqj:
The stars are black bodies so L∝R²T⁴. Observed λmax are the same, but star_2 has v_rad=700 km/s (receding), so its emitted peak λ_emit is λ_obs/(1+v/c), implying T2=T_obs·(1+v/c). Thus T2/T1=1+v/c≈1.00233. The luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)²·(T1/T2)⁴ =1.5²/(1.00233)⁴ ≈2.25/1.00937≈2.23, matching choice4.

### thinking by Debate Agent miv2:
We have two stars radiating as black bodies: L∝R^2T^4. Star_1 has R1=1.5R2, so if T1=T2 then L1/L2=(1.5)^2=2.25. But the stars’ peak wavelengths appear the same only after Doppler shift: star_2’s v=700 km/s redshifts its peak, so its rest‐frame temperature T2 is higher by factor (1+v/c)≈1.00233 relative to T1. Thus T1/T2=1/(1+v/c)≈0.99767, and L1/L2=2.25/(1.00233)^4≈2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent Kjg9:
We have two stars with R1=1.5R2, masses irrelevant for luminosity directly. They radiate as black bodies: L∝R^2T^4. Spectroscopy shows the observed peak wavelengths λ_obs are equal. But Star_2 has radial velocity v=700 km/s, so its observed λ_obs is redshifted: λ_obs=λ_intrinsic·(1+v/c). Star_1 has v=0 so λ_obs1=λ1. Thus λ2_intrinsic=λ_obs/(1+v/c). By Wien’s law T∝1/λ, so T2=T1·(1+v/c). Hence L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2·(T1/T2)^4=(1.5)^2·(1/(1+v/c))^4. With v/c≈700/3×10^5≈0.002333, (1+v/c)^4≈1.009365, so L1/L2≈2.25·0.99072≈2.228, i.e. ~2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent prlr:
Luminosity for a black body: L = 4πR^2σT^4. Given Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature (from Wien’s law since peak wavelengths are identical), the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. With R1/R2 = 1.5, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Thus the closest choice is ~2.25.

    <pre>We use the black‐body luminosity relation L∝R²T⁴. Star 1 has R₁/R₂=1.5. Both stars have the same observed λ_max, but Star 2’s radial velocity v=700 km/s redshifts its spectrum by (1+v/c), so its intrinsic temperature T₂ is higher: T₂=T_obs·(1+v/c). Thus T₁/T₂=1/(1+v/c). The luminosity ratio is L₁/L₂=(1.5)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴=2.25/(1+0.002333)⁴≈2.25/1.00937≈2.23.
