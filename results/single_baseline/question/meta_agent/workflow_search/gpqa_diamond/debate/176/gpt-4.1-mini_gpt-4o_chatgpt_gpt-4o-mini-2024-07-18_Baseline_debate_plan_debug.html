    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 1gqj:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the formula for luminosity of a star, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, the temperatures of the stars are the same as well (by Wien&#39;s Law). Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Given that R1 = 1.5R2, we have L1/L2 = (1.5)² = 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent miv2:
To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we need to consider the formula for luminosity of a black body, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wein&#39;s Law). Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = 1.5² = 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent Kjg9:
The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4, where L is the luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, the temperatures of the stars are equal due to Wien&#39;s displacement law. Therefore, we only need to consider the radii for the luminosity comparison. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2, we can express the luminosity ratio as (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent prlr:
To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, we use the formula for the luminosity of a star, L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Given that both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s Law. Since Star_1&#39;s radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. The radial velocity does not affect luminosity.

Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature according to Wien&#39;s Law. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio.
