    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent gqjm:
To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, we need to consider the properties of black body radiation and the relationship between luminosity, radius, and temperature. The luminosity (L) of a star can be expressed as L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien&#39;s Law). The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 is (1.5)² = 2.25 times greater. The masses and radial velocities are not directly relevant to luminosity in this context.

### thinking by Debate Agent iv2K:
To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we can use the formula for luminosity of a star, L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars radiate as black bodies and have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien&#39;s Law). Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Thus, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. The radial velocities do not affect the luminosity calculation directly. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent jg9p:
To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature. Given Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent rlr6:
To determine the luminosity factor difference between the two stars, we need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for black body radiation, which states that the luminosity L of a star is proportional to its surface area (4πR²) and the fourth power of its temperature (T⁴). Given that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature, according to Wien&#39;s Law. Therefore, the only difference in luminosity comes from the difference in radii. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, its luminosity will be (1.5)² times greater, because L ∝ R². Calculating this gives a factor of 2.25.
