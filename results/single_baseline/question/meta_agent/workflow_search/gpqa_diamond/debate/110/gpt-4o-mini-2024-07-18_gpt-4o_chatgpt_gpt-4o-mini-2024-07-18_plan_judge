Question: Example(question='Complete the following reactions and select the major products by considering the steric hindrance, and the stability of the products.\n2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B', choice1='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile', choice2='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile', choice3='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile', choice4='A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the first reaction involves a Michael addition where the enolate ion of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one attacks ethyl acrylate, leading to the formation of ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate as the major product due to less steric hindrance and greater stability. For the second reaction, 1-nitropropane reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water, resulting in 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile as the major product due to the stability of the formed carbon-carbon bond and minimal steric hindrance. Both reactions favor the products with less steric hindrance and greater stability, which corresponds to choice 3.
