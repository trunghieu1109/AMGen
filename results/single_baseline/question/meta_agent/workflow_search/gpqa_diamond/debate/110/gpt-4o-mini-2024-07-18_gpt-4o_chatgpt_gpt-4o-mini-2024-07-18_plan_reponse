        "response": "All agents agree that the first reaction involves a Michael addition where the enolate ion of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one attacks ethyl acrylate, leading to the formation of ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate as the major product due to less steric hindrance and greater stability. For the second reaction, 1-nitropropane reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water, resulting in 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile as the major product due to the stability of the formed carbon-carbon bond and minimal steric hindrance. Both reactions favor the products with less steric hindrance and greater stability, which corresponds to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
