            "reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?",

        "response": "After analyzing the provided information and the reasoning from various agents, it appears that the consensus leans towards the symmetry group D4h for product E. This is due to the complexity and hazardous nature of E, which suggests a higher symmetry structure. The other options, while possible, do not align as closely with the characteristics typically associated with hazardous compounds. Therefore, D4h is the most reasonable choice based on the context and the analysis of the reactions leading to product E.\n\nAnswer:D4h",
