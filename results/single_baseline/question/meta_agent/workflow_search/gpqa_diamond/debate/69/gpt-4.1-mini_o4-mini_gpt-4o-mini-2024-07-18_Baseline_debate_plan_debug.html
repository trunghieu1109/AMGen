    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C2v&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;D4h&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;D∞h&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent eBBW:
First identify species based on reaction network. The key clues: C hydrolyzes to give one strong acid and one weak acid (HNO3/ HNO2), suggesting C is NO2 (or its dimer). The hazardous E formed by adding 2 eq of D resembles phosgene COCl2; its point‐group is C2v. Thus the correct choice is C2v.

### thinking by Debate Agent ViMF:
Let A be elemental sulfur (S8). Reaction with Cl2 (B) gives sulfur dichloride (SCl2), C – a red fuming liquid. C + H2O → S (A) + HCl (strong acid F) + H2SO3 (weak acid G). D is ethylene (C2H4), which reacts 1:1 with Cl2 to give 1,2-dichloroethane (H), a solvent. C (SCl2) + 2 C2H4 → bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, mustard gas (E), extremely hazardous. Mustard gas has the structure ClCH2CH2–S–CH2CH2Cl, which in its lowest‐energy (anti) conformation has only a C2 axis and no mirror planes or higher symmetry. Therefore its point group is C2.

### thinking by Debate Agent ajPw:
We recognize E as a small planar AX2Y type molecule with two identical substituents and one different one. Such a molecule has a C2 axis through the central atom, plus two mirror planes (one containing the two identical substituents and the axis, one perpendicular to it), but no higher symmetry. That corresponds to the C2v point group.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7FQi:
We recognize that A is platinum metal which reacts with fluorine (gas B) to give bright‐red PtF6 (C). PtF6 oxidizes H2 (gas D) to give the hydrogen molecular cation H2+ (E), an extremely hazardous species. The molecular symmetry group of a diatomic molecule or ion (like H2+) is D∞h.

### answer by Debate Agent eBBW:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent ViMF:
C2

### answer by Debate Agent ajPw:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 7FQi:
D∞h

    <pre>The reaction network fits A = S8, B = Cl2 → C = SCl2 (bright red). C + H2O → S8 + HCl (strong acid) + H2SO3 (weak acid). D = C2H4, which with Cl2 gives 1,2-dichloroethane (solvent). C + 2 C2H4 → sulphur mustard (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide) as E, an extremely hazardous agent. The lowest‐energy conformer of mustard gas has only a C2 axis, no mirror planes or higher symmetry. Therefore its point group is C2.
