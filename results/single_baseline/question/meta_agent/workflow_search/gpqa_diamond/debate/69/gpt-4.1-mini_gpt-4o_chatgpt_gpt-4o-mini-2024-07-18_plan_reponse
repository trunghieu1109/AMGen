        "response": "The problem involves deducing the identities of the compounds based on the given reactions. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C suggests a metal halide or similar compound. C reacting with water to reform A and produce two acids, one strong and one weak, suggests that C could be a metal chloride, with the strong acid being HCl and the weak acid possibly being HClO. Gas D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent, suggests D is hydrogen and B is chlorine, forming HCl. The hazardous product E formed from C and D could be a diatomic molecule like Cl2, which is known to be hazardous and has a D\u221eh symmetry group. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is likely D\u221eh.\n\nAnswer:D)",
