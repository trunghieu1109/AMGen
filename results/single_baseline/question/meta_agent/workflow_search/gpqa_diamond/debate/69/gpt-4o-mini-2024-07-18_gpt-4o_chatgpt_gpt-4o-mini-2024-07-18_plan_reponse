        "response": "The problem involves deducing the identities of compounds based on a series of chemical reactions. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form hazardous product E. C also reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). D reacts with B to form solvent H. The clues suggest that A is likely P4 (white phosphorus), B is Cl2 (chlorine gas), and C is PCl5, which is red. E, formed from C and D, is likely POCl3, which is hazardous. However, the question asks for the symmetry of E, which might be confused with another compound. Given the options, D\u221eh fits with a linear triatomic molecule, likely Cl2O7, which is extremely hazardous and fits the context. Thus, the symmetry group of E is D\u221eh.\n\nAnswer:D)",
