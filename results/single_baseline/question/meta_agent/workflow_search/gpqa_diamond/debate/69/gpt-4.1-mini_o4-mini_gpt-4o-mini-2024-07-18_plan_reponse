            "reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?",

        "response": "The reaction network fits A = S8, B = Cl2 \u2192 C = SCl2 (bright red). C + H2O \u2192 S8 + HCl (strong acid) + H2SO3 (weak acid). D = C2H4, which with Cl2 gives 1,2-dichloroethane (solvent). C + 2 C2H4 \u2192 sulphur mustard (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide) as E, an extremely hazardous agent. The lowest\u2010energy conformer of mustard gas has only a C2 axis, no mirror planes or higher symmetry. Therefore its point group is C2.\n\nAnswer:A)",
