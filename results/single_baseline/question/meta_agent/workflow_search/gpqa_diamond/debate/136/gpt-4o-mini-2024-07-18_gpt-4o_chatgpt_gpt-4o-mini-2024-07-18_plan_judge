Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the energy gained per revolution and compare it to the total energy required. The proton is accelerated twice per revolution by the alternating voltage, gaining energy equal to twice the peak voltage per revolution. Given the total kinetic energy T1 = 950 MeV and the peak voltage U0 = 190 kV, the energy gained per revolution is 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. The number of revolutions required to reach 950 MeV is 950,000 keV / 380 keV per revolution, which equals 2500 revolutions. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.
