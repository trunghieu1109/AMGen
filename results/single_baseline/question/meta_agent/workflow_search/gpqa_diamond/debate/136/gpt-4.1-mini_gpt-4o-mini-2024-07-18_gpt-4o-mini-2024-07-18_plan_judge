The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by\nU\\left(t\\right)=U{0}\\cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu\\left(\\alpha\\right)t+\\Phi_{0}\\right].\n\nHow many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?\nData : \\$\\Phi{0}=\\frac{\\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\\$. ', choice1='1864', choice2='2500', choice3='3536', choice4='5300', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the frequency of the alternating voltage and the energy gained by the proton. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is given as T1 = 950 MeV. We can convert this energy into joules and then find the corresponding frequency using the relationship between energy and frequency in a synchrocyclotron. The formula for the frequency of revolution in a cyclotron is related to the mass and charge of the proton and the energy gained. After calculating the frequency, we can find the time taken to reach the maximum energy and then multiply by the frequency to get the total number of revolutions. The calculations and reasoning lead to the conclusion that the number of revolutions is 3536, which corresponds to choice C.
