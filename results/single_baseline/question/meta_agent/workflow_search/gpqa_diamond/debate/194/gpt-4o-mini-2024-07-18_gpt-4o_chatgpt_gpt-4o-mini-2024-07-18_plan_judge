Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can exhibit both transit and occultation events in a system where the first planet has a known orbital period and impact parameter. The key is to ensure that the second planet's orbit allows it to pass in front of and behind the star from our line of sight. The impact parameter for transit must be less than or equal to 1, and for occultation, the planet must also pass behind the star. Since the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first, it will have the same impact parameter condition. The maximum orbital period is determined by the maximum allowable semi-major axis that still satisfies these conditions. Using Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of the orbital periods is proportional to the 3/2 power of the ratio of the semi-major axes. Given the star's radius and the planet's radius, the calculations show that the maximum period corresponds to choice 2, which is approximately 33.5 days.
