Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For the second planet to both transit and be occulted, its impact parameter b2 = (a2/a1)·b1 must be less than 1 − Rp2/R★. Here Rp2/R★ ≈ (2.5 R⊕)/(1.5 R☉) ≈ 0.0153, so 1 − k2 ≈ 0.9847. Thus a2/a1 < (1 − k2)/b1 ≈ 0.9847/0.2 ≈ 4.9235. From Kepler’s third law, P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2), so P2_max ≈ 3 d × (4.9235)^(3/2) ≈ 33 d, matching choice B.
