            "Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.",

        "response": "For the second planet to both transit and be occulted, its impact parameter b2 = (a2/a1)\u00b7b1 must be less than 1 \u2212 Rp2/R\u2605. Here Rp2/R\u2605 \u2248 (2.5\u2009R\u2295)/(1.5\u2009R\u2609) \u2248 0.0153, so 1 \u2212 k2 \u2248 0.9847. Thus a2/a1 < (1 \u2212 k2)/b1 \u2248 0.9847/0.2 \u2248 4.9235. From Kepler\u2019s third law, P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2), so P2_max \u2248 3\u2009d \u00d7 (4.9235)^(3/2) \u2248 33\u2009d, matching choice B.\n\nAnswer:B",
