Redshift z ≃ (790 nm/121.6 nm)−1 ≃ 5.5. The comoving distance D_C = (c/H₀)∫₀^{5.5}dz/√[Ω_m(1+z)³+Ω_Λ] ≃ 4286 Mpc×1.91 ≃ 8200 Mpc ≃ 8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mOpJ:\nThe sharp drop in flux shortward of 790 nm indicates the Lyman-α break (rest 121.6 nm) redshifted to 790 nm, so (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM universe (H₀=70, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is roughly 8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent VPtN:\nThe sharp drop at observed wavelength 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-α break at 121.6 nm. Solving (790/121.6)–1 gives z ≃ 5.5. In a flat ΛCDM with H₀=70, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is about 8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MbCN:\nWe observe a sharp drop in flux at λobs≈790\u2009nm, which we identify as the Gunn–Peterson trough at Lyman-α (rest λ=121.6\u2009nm). Hence (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. To get comoving distance D_C we integrate\n D_C = (c/H0) ∫0^z dz'/√(Ωm(1+z')^3+ΩΛ)\n with H0=70\u2009km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7. Numerically this yields D_C≈7.8\u2009Gpc, so ≈8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Zd4s:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mOpJ:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent VPtN:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MbCN:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
