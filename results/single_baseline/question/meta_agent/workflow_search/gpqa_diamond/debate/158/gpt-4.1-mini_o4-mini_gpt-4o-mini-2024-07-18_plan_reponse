            "Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?",

In a flat \u039bCDM universe with H\u2080=70 km/s/Mpc and \u03a9\u2098=0.3, \u03a9_\u039b=0.7, the comoving distance to z\u22485.5 is about 8 Gpc.\n\nAnswer:A)",
