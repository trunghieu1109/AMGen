Thus H = ε σ·n has eigenvalues ε·(±1) = ±ε, corresponding to choice1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent AXcv:\nThe operator σ·n with n a unit vector has eigenvalues ±1 (since (σ·n)^2=I). Thus H=ε(σ·n) has eigenvalues ±ε, corresponding to choice1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent dOPP:\nThe Hamiltonian is H=ε\u2009σ·n. The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 (since any Pauli matrix combination along a unit vector squares to identity). Thus H’s eigenvalues are ε times ±1, i.e. +ε and –ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MUaN:\nThe operator σ·n is a Pauli matrix in the direction n, whose eigenvalues are ±1.
