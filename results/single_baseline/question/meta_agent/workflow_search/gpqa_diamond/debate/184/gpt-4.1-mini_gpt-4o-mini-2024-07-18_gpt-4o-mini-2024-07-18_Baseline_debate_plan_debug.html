### thinking by Debate Agent OPPM:
The Hamiltonian operator given is $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by recognizing that $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ represents a projection of the spin along the direction of the unit vector $\vec{n}$. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of +1 and -1, hence when multiplied by the constant $\varepsilon$, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian become $+\varepsilon$ and $-\varepsilon$. Therefore, the correct choice that matches these eigenvalues is the first option.

### thinking by Debate Agent UaNN:
To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, we recognize that $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues of +1 and -1. The Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of these eigenvalues, scaled by the constant $\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian will be $\varepsilon$ times the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices, which gives us +$\varepsilon$ and -$\varepsilon$. Thus, the correct choice corresponds to the eigenvalues being +$\varepsilon$ and -$\varepsilon$.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZUcK:
The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = ε σ·n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator that is linear in the Pauli matrices can be derived from the properties of these matrices. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1, and since the Hamiltonian scales these eigenvalues by ε, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian will be ±ε. Therefore, the correct choice that reflects the eigenvalues is &#39;+ ε, -ε&#39;.

### thinking by Debate Agent zrgh:
The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = ε σ·n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by recognizing that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H will be ±ε, since ε is a constant that scales the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices. Thus, the correct answer is &#39;+ ε, -ε&#39;.

    <pre>The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε σ·n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Therefore, when we scale these eigenvalues by the constant ε, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian become ±ε. This reasoning is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are indeed +ε and -ε.
