Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε σ·n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Therefore, when we scale these eigenvalues by the constant ε, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian become ±ε. This reasoning is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are indeed +ε and -ε.
