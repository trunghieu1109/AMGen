proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices and $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector. The expression $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, which behaves like a Pauli matrix itself. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are known to be +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ are +1 and -1. When this is scaled by $\varepsilon$, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$ become $+\varepsilon$ and $-\varepsilon$. All agents agree on this reasoning, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is A).
