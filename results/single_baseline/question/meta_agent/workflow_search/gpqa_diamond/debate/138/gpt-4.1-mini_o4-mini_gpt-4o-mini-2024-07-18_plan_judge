Question: Example(question='Two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Through the mentioned treatment two different diketones are produced. Select the proper starting materials A and B for the reactions.\nA + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\nB + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione', choice1='A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol', choice2='A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol', choice3='A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one', choice4='A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Nitrous acid (HCl/NaNO₂/H₂O) oxidizes vicinal diols or α-hydroxy (or α-methoxy) alcohols to 1,2-diketones. To form 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, A must be the α-methoxycyclohexanol (4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol), which hydrolyzes to the vicinal diol and then oxidizes. To form 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, B must be the vicinal diol 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. Only choice 2 matches these requirements.
