        "response": "Nitrous acid (HCl/NaNO\u2082/H\u2082O) oxidizes vicinal diols or \u03b1-hydroxy (or \u03b1-methoxy) alcohols to 1,2-diketones. To form 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, A must be the \u03b1-methoxycyclohexanol (4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol), which hydrolyzes to the vicinal diol and then oxidizes. To form 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, B must be the vicinal diol 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. Only choice 2 matches these requirements.\n\nAnswer:B)",
