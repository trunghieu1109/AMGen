        "response": "The pp-III branch in the Sun is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly those in the 800-900 keV range. If the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in this higher energy band would decrease significantly. The 700-800 keV band is less affected because it is more associated with the pp-I and pp-II branches. Therefore, the flux ratio of band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) would increase, as the flux in band 2 decreases more than in band 1. This suggests that the ratio will be greater than 1, likely around 10.\n\nAnswer:10.",
