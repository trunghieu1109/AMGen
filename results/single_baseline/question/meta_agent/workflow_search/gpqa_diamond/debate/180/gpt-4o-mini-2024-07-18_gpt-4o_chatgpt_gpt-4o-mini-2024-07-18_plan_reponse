            "Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other.

        "response": "The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly from the decay of Boron-8. These neutrinos are generally of much higher energy than the 700-900 keV range specified in the question. The stopping of the pp-III branch would primarily affect the flux of these high-energy neutrinos, not the lower energy bands mentioned. The neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are more likely produced by other reactions, such as those in the pp-I and pp-II branches, which are not affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. Therefore, the flux ratio between the two energy bands should remain largely unchanged, as the stopping of the pp-III branch does not significantly impact these energy ranges.\n\nAnswer:C)",
