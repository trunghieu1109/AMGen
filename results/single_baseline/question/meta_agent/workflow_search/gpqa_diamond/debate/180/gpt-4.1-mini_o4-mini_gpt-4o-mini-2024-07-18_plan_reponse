            "Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It\u2019s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)",

Band 2 (800\u2013900 keV) receives the 7Be 861 keV line (~5\u00d710^9 cm\u207b2s\u207b1) plus a similar CNO contribution (~10^8). Thus flux1/flux2 \u224310^8/5\u00d710^9 \u22432\u00d710\u207b2, so the closest choice is 10\u207b2.\n\nAnswer:D)",
