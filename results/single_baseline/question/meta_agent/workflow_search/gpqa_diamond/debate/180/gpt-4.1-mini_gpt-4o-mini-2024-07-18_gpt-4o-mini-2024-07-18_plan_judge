Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the flux of neutrinos in the two energy bands (700-800 KeV and 800-900 keV) after the hypothetical stopping of the pp-III branch, we analyze the impact of this cessation on neutrino production. The pp-III branch primarily contributes to the lower energy band (700-800 keV), and stopping it would significantly reduce the flux in that band compared to the higher energy band (800-900 keV), which is less affected. Given the nature of neutrino production, the flux in the lower energy band is expected to be lower than in the higher energy band after the pp-III branch stops. The most reasonable estimate for the flux ratio based on the expected distribution of neutrinos is 0.1 (10^-1), indicating that the lower energy band produces significantly fewer neutrinos than the higher energy band after the cessation of the pp-III branch.
