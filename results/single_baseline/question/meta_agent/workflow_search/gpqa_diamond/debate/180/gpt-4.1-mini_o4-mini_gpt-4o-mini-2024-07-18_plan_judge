Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Neutrino sources: band 1 (700–800 keV) receives no pp or 7Be neutrinos, only CNO (13N+15O) at order ≲10^8 cm⁻2s⁻1 once B8 (pp-III) is shut off. Band 2 (800–900 keV) receives the 7Be 861 keV line (~5×10^9 cm⁻2s⁻1) plus a similar CNO contribution (~10^8). Thus flux1/flux2 ≃10^8/5×10^9 ≃2×10⁻2, so the closest choice is 10⁻2.
