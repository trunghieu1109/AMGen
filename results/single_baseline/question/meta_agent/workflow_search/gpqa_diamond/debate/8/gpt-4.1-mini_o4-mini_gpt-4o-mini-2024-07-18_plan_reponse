        "response": "A C3h point group has a single C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) but no perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirrors. Quinuclidine is not trigonal, and triisopropyl borate\u2019s sp3 alkoxy substituents destroy any \u03c3h. The large fused triphenylene derivative retains additional perpendicular symmetry elements (D3h). The benzo-trifuran hexaone is planar, has a threefold axis through the center, its molecular plane is a mirror, and its furan substituents eliminate any C2 axes in the plane, giving C3h symmetry.\n\nAnswer:C",
