            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",

        "response": "In the context of studying the proteome of active chromatin during the formation of the shmoo in yeast, we are interested in complexes that are involved in transcription and gene expression. The pre-initiation complex is crucial for transcription initiation, while the enhancer protein complex enhances transcriptional activity. The pre-replication complex is associated with DNA replication, which is not directly related to transcription. The nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin but does not specifically indicate active transcription. Since the question asks for the least likely complex to be observed in the context of active chromatin during transcription, the pre-replication complex is the least relevant complex to be observed in this assay. Therefore, the answer is B) pre-replication complex.\n\nAnswer:B",
