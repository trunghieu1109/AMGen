Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the active chromatin of the shmoo in yeast. The shmoo formation is related to mating and involves transcriptional activation rather than DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are involved in transcription and chromatin structure, which are relevant to the shmoo formation. However, the pre-replication complex is specifically involved in DNA replication, not transcription, and is therefore least likely to be associated with active chromatin during shmoo formation. All agents agree that the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be observed.
