            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",

        "response": "The task is to determine which protein complex would be least observed in an assay focused on the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of yeast. The shmoo formation is associated with mating and involves transcriptional changes rather than DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex are involved in transcription, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not directly related to the transcriptional activity associated with shmoo formation. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex are least likely to be observed in the assay.\n\nAnswer:B)",
