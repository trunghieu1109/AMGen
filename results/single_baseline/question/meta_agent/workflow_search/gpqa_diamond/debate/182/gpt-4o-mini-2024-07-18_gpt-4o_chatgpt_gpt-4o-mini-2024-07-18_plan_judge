Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the number of rings and multiple bonds in a compound. The original compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring, a vinyl group, a formyl group, and a carboxylic acid group, contributing to an IHD of 4. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, these groups are reduced, resulting in a fully saturated cyclohexane derivative. This means all double bonds and unsaturations are removed, leaving only the cyclohexane ring, which contributes an IHD of 1. Therefore, the final IHD of the product is 1.
