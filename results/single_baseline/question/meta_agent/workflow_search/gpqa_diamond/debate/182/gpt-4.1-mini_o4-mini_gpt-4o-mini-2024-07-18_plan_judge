Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Red phosphorus with HI reduces the –CHO and –COOH groups to methylene units (removing two degrees of unsaturation) but does not hydrogenate the existing C=C bonds. The starting cyclohexene ring has one ring + two C=C (one in the ring, one vinyl) = 3 IHD. Removing the two C=O unsaturations leaves 3 IHD.

Answer:B)
