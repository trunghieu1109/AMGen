Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves the decay of a stationary Pi(+) meson into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass energy of the Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass energy of the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The energy available for the kinetic energy of the mu(+) and the neutrino is the difference in rest energy between the Pi(+) and the mu(+), which is 33.9 MeV. This energy is split between the kinetic energy of the mu(+) and the energy of the neutrino. Using conservation of energy and momentum, the kinetic energy of the mu(+) is found to be 4.12 MeV and the energy of the neutrino is 29.8 MeV. This matches choice D).
