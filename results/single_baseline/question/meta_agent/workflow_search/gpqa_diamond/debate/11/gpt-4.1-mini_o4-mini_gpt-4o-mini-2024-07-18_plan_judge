Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: For π+ at rest decaying to μ+ and ν, use E_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2m_π) and E_ν = (m_π² − m_μ²)/(2m_π). With m_π = 139.6 MeV and m_μ = 105.7 MeV: E_μ ≈109.82 MeV ⇒ KE_μ ≈109.82−105.7=4.12 MeV; E_ν ≈29.8 MeV (all kinetic). This matches choice 4.
