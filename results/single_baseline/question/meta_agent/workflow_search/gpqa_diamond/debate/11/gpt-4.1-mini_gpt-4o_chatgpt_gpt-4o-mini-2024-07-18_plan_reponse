        "response": "The problem involves the decay of a stationary Pi(+) meson into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass energy of the Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass energy of the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The energy available for the kinetic energy of the mu(+) and the neutrino is the difference in rest energy between the Pi(+) and the mu(+), which is 33.9 MeV. This energy is split between the kinetic energy of the mu(+) and the energy of the neutrino. Using conservation of energy and momentum, the kinetic energy of the mu(+) is found to be 4.12 MeV and the energy of the neutrino is 29.8 MeV. This matches choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
