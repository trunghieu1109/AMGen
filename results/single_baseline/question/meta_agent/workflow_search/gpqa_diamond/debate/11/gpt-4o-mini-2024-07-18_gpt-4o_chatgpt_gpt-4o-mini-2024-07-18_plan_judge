Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves the decay of a stationary Pi(+) meson into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy is shared between the mu(+) and the neutrino. The rest mass energy of the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy of the mu(+) is the difference between its total energy and its rest mass energy. The neutrino is assumed to have negligible mass, so its energy is entirely kinetic. The total kinetic energy of the mu(+) and neutrino is 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. We need to find the pair of kinetic energies from the choices that add up to 33.9 MeV. Choice D) 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV adds up to 33.9 MeV, which matches the calculated total kinetic energy.
