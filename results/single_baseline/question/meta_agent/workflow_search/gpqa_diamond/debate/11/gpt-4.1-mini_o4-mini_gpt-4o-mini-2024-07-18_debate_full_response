Using m_π = 139.6 MeV, m_μ = 105.7 MeV: \nE_μ = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≃ 109.82 MeV, so KE_μ = 109.82 – 105.7 ≃ 4.12 MeV. \nE_ν = (139.6^2 – 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≃ 29.8 MeV (all kinetic). This matches choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ScY8:\nThe decay π+→μ+ + ν gives a fixed neutrino energy E_ν = (m_π² − m_μ²)/(2m_π) and muon total energy E_μ = m_π − E_ν. Subtracting m_μ from E_μ gives the muon KE. Numerically: m_π=139.6\u2009MeV, m_μ=105.7\u2009MeV, so E_ν≈(139.6²−105.7²)/(2·139.6)=29.8\u2009MeV, and T_μ=E_μ−m_μ=(139.6−29.8)−105.7=4.1\u2009MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Chfg:\nFor a two-body decay π+→μ+ν with π+ at rest and mπ=139.6 MeV, mμ=105.7 MeV, the muon energy is Eμ=(mπ^2+mμ^2)/(2mπ) and the neutrino energy Eν=(mπ^2−mμ^2)/(2mπ). Numerically mπ^2=19488.16 MeV^2, mμ^2=11172.49 MeV^2, so Eν=8315.67/(2×139.6)≈29.8 MeV and Eμ=(19488.16+11172.49)/(2×139.6)≈109.85 MeV giving KEμ=Eμ−mμ≈4.15 MeV. Thus KEμ≈4.12 MeV, KEν≈29.8 MeV, matching choice4 which is D).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Vz4B:\nUse two-body decay formulas in the rest frame: E_μ=(m_π²+m_μ²)/(2m_π), so T_μ=E_μ−m_μ; E_ν=(m_π²−m_μ²)/(2m_π) (m_ν≈0). With m_π=139.6\u2009MeV, m_μ=105.7\u2009MeV: E_μ≈109.8\u2009MeV ⇒ T_μ≈4.1\u2009MeV; E_ν≈29.8\u2009MeV ⇒ T_ν≈29.8\u2009MeV.
