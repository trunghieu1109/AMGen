### thinking by Debate Agent fmuh:
To find the interaction energy of a point charge q outside a grounded conducting sphere, we use the method of images. The image charge is q&#39; = -q R/d located at distance R^2/d from the center. The separation between real and image charges is d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d. For a point charge near a grounded conductor, the electrostatic energy equals half the Coulomb energy between the real charge and its image. Thus U = (1/2) k q q&#39; / separation = (1/2) k q (-q R/d) / [(d^2 - R^2)/d] = - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2).

### thinking by Debate Agent Xwoc:
To find the interaction energy of a point charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, use the method of images. The image charge is q&#39; = -q R/d located at distance d&#39; = R^2/d from the center. The potential at the real charge due to the image is V_image = k q&#39;/(d - d&#39;) = -k q R/(d^2 - R^2). Since the conductor is grounded and induced charges form in response to q, the work to bring q in from infinity is U = 1/2 q V_image = -Â½ k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).

### thinking by Debate Agent xahL:
We have a grounded conducting sphere of radius R and a point charge q located at distance d (&gt;R) from its center. Using the method of images, the sphere can be replaced by an image charge q&#39; = -q R/d located at distance d&#39; = R^2/d inside the sphere along the same line. The interaction energy between the real charge and its image is U_int = k q q&#39; / |d - d&#39;| = k q ( -q R/d ) / ((d - R^2/d)) = - k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). However, since the conductor is grounded, the net potential energy of the real charge with the induced charge distribution equals half this interaction energy (the familiar 1/2 factor when assembling charges). Therefore U = (1/2) U_int = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2), which corresponds to choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent 5mTm:
We use the method of images. A point charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R can be modeled by an image charge q&#39; = -q R/d placed at distance a = R^2/d inside the sphere. The electrostatic interaction energy between the real and image charges is U = (1/2) k q q&#39; / (separation). Here separation = d - a = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d. Thus U = (1/2) k q (-q R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2).

The interaction energy between q and q&#39; is U_int = k q q&#39;/(d - R^2/d) = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).
