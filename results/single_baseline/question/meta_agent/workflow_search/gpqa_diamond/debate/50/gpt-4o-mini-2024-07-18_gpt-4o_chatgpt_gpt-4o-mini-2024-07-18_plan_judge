Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. To solve this, we use the method of image charges. The image charge q' is placed inside the sphere at a distance R^2/d from the center, with magnitude q' = -qR/d. The potential energy U of the system is due to the interaction between the real charge q and the image charge q'. The distance between the real charge and the image charge is d - R^2/d. The potential energy is given by U = k * q * q' / (d - R^2/d). Substituting q' = -qR/d, we get U = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2). This matches choice 1.
