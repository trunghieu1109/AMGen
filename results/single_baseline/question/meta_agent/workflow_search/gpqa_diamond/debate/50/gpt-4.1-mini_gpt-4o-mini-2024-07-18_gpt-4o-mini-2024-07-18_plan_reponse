        "response": "To determine the net potential energy of a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, we apply the method of images. The grounded sphere induces a charge that affects the potential energy of the system. After analyzing the provided options and considering the principles of electrostatics, the correct expression for the potential energy is identified as U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2). This matches with the second choice provided.\n\nAnswer:B",
