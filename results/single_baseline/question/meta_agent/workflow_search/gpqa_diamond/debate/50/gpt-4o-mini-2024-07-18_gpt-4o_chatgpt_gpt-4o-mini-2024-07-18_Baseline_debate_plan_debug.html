To solve this problem, we consider the method of image charges. A grounded conducting sphere in the presence of a point charge can be treated by introducing an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q&#39; is placed at a distance R^2/d from the center of the sphere, and its magnitude is q&#39; = -qR/d. The potential energy of the system is due to the interaction between the real charge q and the image charge q&#39;. The potential energy U can be calculated using the formula for potential energy between two point charges: U = k * q * q&#39; / r, where r is the distance between the charges. In this setup, r = d - R^2/d. Substituting q&#39; and r into the formula gives U = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d). Simplifying this expression, we find U = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2).

To solve this problem, we use the method of image charges. A grounded conducting sphere can be analyzed by introducing an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q&#39; and its position can be determined using the formula q&#39; = -q * R/d and the position of the image charge is at a distance R^2/d from the center of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is due to the interaction between the real charge q and the image charge q&#39;. The potential energy U of the system is given by U = k * q * q&#39; / (d - R^2/d). Substituting q&#39; = -q * R/d into the expression for U gives U = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2). This matches choice 1.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the method of image charges. When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, an image charge q&#39; is introduced inside the sphere to satisfy the boundary condition of zero potential on the surface of the sphere. The image charge q&#39; is placed at a distance R^2/d from the center of the sphere, and its magnitude is -(qR/d). The potential energy of the system is the interaction energy between the real charge q and the image charge q&#39;. The formula for the potential energy U due to point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant, q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between them. Here, q1 = q, q2 = -(qR/d), and r = d - R^2/d. Substituting these values into the formula gives U = k * q * (-(qR/d)) / (d - R^2/d). Simplifying this expression leads to the potential energy of the system.

To solve this problem, we use the method of image charges. For a grounded conducting sphere of radius R and a charge q placed at a distance d from the center, an image charge q&#39; is placed inside the sphere at a distance R^2/d from the center. The magnitude of the image charge q&#39; is given by -qR/d. The potential energy of the system is due to the interaction between the actual charge q and the image charge q&#39;. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where r is the distance between the charges. Here, the distance between q and q&#39; is d - R^2/d. Substituting the values, we get U = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d). Simplifying this expression gives U = -kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2).
