Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Using the method of images: replace the grounded sphere by an image charge q' = -q R/d at distance R^2/d. The interaction energy between q and q' is U_int = k q q'/(d - R^2/d) = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). For a grounded conductor the net energy is half of this: U = (1/2)U_int = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2), which matches choice A).
