Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the net potential energy of a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, we apply the method of images. The grounded sphere induces a charge that affects the potential energy of the system. After analyzing the provided options and considering the principles of electrostatics, the correct expression for the potential energy is identified as U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2). This matches with the second choice provided.
