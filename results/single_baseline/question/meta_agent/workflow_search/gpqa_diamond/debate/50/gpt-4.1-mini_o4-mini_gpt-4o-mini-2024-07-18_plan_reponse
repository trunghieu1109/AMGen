        "response": "Using the method of images: replace the grounded sphere by an image charge q' = -q R/d at distance R^2/d. The interaction energy between q and q' is U_int = k q q'/(d - R^2/d) = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). For a grounded conductor the net energy is half of this: U = (1/2)U_int = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2), which matches choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
