Choice 1 matches these conditions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent yjui:\nThe Mott–Gurney law applies to space-charge-limited current in trap-free, single-carrier materials under ideal injection conditions (i.e., no barrier at the contact, i.e., Ohmic contact or equivalently “no carrier injection barrier”) and assumes diffusion currents are negligible. Other scenarios (two-carrier, Schottky contacts, or neglecting drift) do not meet the standard SCLC assumptions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent iSdD:\nThe Mott–Gurney law describes space-charge-limited current in a trap-free single-carrier device with ideal injection (Ohmic contact), negligible diffusion, and no injection barrier. Statement 1 matches: trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (i.e., Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion. Other choices mention Schottky contact, two carriers, or neglect drift, which are incorrect for SCLC. Thus choice A is correct.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent uhr9:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent oWWe:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yjui:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent iSdD:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
