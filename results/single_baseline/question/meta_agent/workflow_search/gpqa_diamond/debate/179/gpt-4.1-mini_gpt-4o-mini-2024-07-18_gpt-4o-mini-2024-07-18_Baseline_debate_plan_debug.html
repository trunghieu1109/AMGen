    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2.822 x 10^-26&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5.645 x 10^-26&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;7.056 x 10^-27&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;122.330&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent f5Ui:
To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge at point P and each of the 12 charges constrained at a distance of 2 m from P. The potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e (where e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C), and they are all at a distance of 2 m from the charge at point P. Therefore, the total potential energy of the system can be calculated by summing the potential energy contributions from each of the 12 charges. Since all charges are identical and equidistant from the fixed charge, the total energy will be 12 times the potential energy of one pair of charges. After calculating the potential energy for one charge and multiplying by 12, we can compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct answer.

To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the interactions between the charges. Each of the 12 particles with charge 2e is at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P, also with charge 2e. The potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, we have 12 interactions between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges. Therefore, the total potential energy will be U_total = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e) / 2). Substituting the values, we find e (the elementary charge) is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C. Thus, U_total = 12 * (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C² * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C)² / 2 m). Calculating this gives us the total energy of the system, which we can then round to three decimal places to find the answer.

To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the electrostatic interactions between the charges. The potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, we have 12 charges of 2e each, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). Since the 12 charges are at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P, we can calculate the potential energy for each of the 12 charges with respect to the charge at P and then sum these energies to find the total energy of the system. The total energy U_total can be calculated as U_total = 12 * (k * (2e * 2e) / 2). After substituting the values, we can find the answer and choose the closest option.

The total energy will be 12 times the potential energy of one charge with the charge at P.
