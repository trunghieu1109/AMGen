Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We split the total electrostatic energy into center–shell and shell–shell contributions. For q=2e and R=2 m, the center–shell term is U_cs = 12·kq²/R = 6kq² ≃5.54×10⁻²⁷ J. The 12 charges on the sphere form an icosahedron; summing their mutual pairwise interactions gives a dimensionless sum S ≃49.14, so U_ss = kq²/R·S ≃2.269×10⁻²⁶ J. Adding yields U ≃2.823×10⁻²⁶ J, which corresponds to choice A).
