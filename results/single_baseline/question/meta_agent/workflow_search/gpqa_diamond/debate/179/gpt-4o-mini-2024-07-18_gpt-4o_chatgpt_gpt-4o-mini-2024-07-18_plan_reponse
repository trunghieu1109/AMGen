        "response": "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N m\u00b2/C\u00b2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Each charge is 2e, where e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C, so each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C. The distance r is 2 m. The potential energy for one pair is U_pair = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2. There are 12 such pairs, so the total energy is 12 * U_pair. Substituting the values: U_pair = (8.988 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. Calculate this and multiply by 12 to get the total energy. The calculation gives U_total = 12 * (8.988 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19)^2 / 2 = 5.645 x 10^-26 J. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
