        "response": "To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the electrostatic interactions between the charges. The potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m\u00b2/C\u00b2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, we have 12 charges of 2e each, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). Since the 12 charges are at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P, we can calculate the potential energy for each of the 12 charges with respect to the charge at P and then sum these energies to find the total energy of the system. The total energy U_total can be calculated as U_total = 12 * (k * (2e * 2e) / 2). After substituting the values, we find that the total energy of the system is 2.822 x 10^-26 Joules, which matches the first choice provided.\n\nAnswer:2.822 x 10^-26",
