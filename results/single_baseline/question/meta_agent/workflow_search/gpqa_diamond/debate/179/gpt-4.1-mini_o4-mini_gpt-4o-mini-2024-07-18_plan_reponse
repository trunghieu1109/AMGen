            "Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?",

        "response": "We split the total electrostatic energy into center\u2013shell and shell\u2013shell contributions. For q=2e and R=2 m, the center\u2013shell term is U_cs = 12\u00b7kq\u00b2/R = 6kq\u00b2 \u22435.54\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2077 J. The 12 charges on the sphere form an icosahedron; summing their mutual pairwise interactions gives a dimensionless sum S \u224349.14, so U_ss = kq\u00b2/R\u00b7S \u22432.269\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2076 J. Adding yields U \u22432.823\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2076 J, which corresponds to choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
