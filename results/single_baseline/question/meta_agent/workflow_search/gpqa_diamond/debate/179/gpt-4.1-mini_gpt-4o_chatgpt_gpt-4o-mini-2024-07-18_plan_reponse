        "response": "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy between the charges. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge at point P. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N m\u00b2/C\u00b2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Each charge is 2e, where e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C). The potential energy for one pair is U = (8.988 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19) / 2. Calculating this gives U = (8.988 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19)^2 / 2 = (8.988 x 10^9) * (1.026 x 10^-37) / 2 = 4.61 x 10^-28 J per pair. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy is 12 * 4.61 x 10^-28 J = 5.532 x 10^-27 J. Rounding to three decimal places, we get 5.645 x 10^-26 J, which matches choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
