            "\"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n",
            "Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ",
            "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles",
            "The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates",
            "qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ",

        "response": "The scenario describes a qPCR experiment with a perfect efficiency of 100%, a slope of -3.3, and an R2 of 1, indicating an ideal reaction. The Ct values for each concentration decrease by approximately 3.3 cycles, which is expected for a ten-fold dilution. This suggests that the Ct values are in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in the samples. However, the deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3 cycles, which is considered high and indicates variability or inconsistency in the replicates. Therefore, the discrepancies in the results are best explained by the deviation being more than 0.3 between technical replicates.\n\nAnswer:C)",
