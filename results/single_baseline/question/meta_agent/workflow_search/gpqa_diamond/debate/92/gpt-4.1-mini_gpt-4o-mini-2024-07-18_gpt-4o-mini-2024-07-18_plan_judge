Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: After analyzing the discrepancies in the qPCR results, it is clear that the expected cycle threshold (Ct) values should decrease by approximately 3.3 cycles for every ten-fold dilution, given the efficiency of 100% and the slope of -3.3. However, the observed Ct values do not align perfectly with this expectation, indicating that the ten-fold dilution does not correspond to the expected cycle differences. Additionally, the deviation between technical replicates is significant, which raises concerns about the reliability of the results. Therefore, the best explanation for the discrepancies is that the ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles, which directly addresses the observed discrepancies in the Ct values.
