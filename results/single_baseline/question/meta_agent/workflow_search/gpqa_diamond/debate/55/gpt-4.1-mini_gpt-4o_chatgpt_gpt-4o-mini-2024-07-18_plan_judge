proposed answer: The problem involves determining the correct transition route and probability for a hydrogen atom state transition via dipole transitions. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ and the final state is |1,0,0⟩. Dipole transitions require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. From |3,0,0⟩, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. The only valid transition to |1,0,0⟩ is from |2,1,0⟩. The probability for this transition route is given as 1/3 in choice 2. All agents agree on this reasoning.
