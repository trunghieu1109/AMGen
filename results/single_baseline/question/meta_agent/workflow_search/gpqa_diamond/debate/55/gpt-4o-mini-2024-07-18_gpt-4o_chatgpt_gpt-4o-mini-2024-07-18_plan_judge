Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the correct transition route from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions is through the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩. This is because the dipole selection rules require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ satisfies these rules with Δl = 1 and Δm = 0, and the subsequent transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ also satisfies the rules with Δl = -1 and Δm = 0. The probability given for this transition route is 1/3, which is consistent with the typical calculations for dipole transitions in hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the correct choice is B.
