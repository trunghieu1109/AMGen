### thinking by Debate Agent QGSl:
The hydrogen atom E1 selection rules allow Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1 at each photon emission. From |3,0,0⟩ the first dipole transition populates |2,1,m⟩ with probabilities proportional to |C(0,0;1,q|1,m)|^2=1/3 for m=0,±1. The only route that leads to |1,0,0⟩ with Δm total=0 is via m=0, giving the dominant branch |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with branching ratio 1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SKA:
We consider spontaneous dipole transitions from |3,0,0&gt; (l=0,m=0) to |2,1,m&#39;&gt; then to |1,0,0&gt;.  The first step branches equally among m&#39;=−1,0,1 (each 1/3).  The second step from |2,1,m&#39;&gt; to |1,0,0&gt; has probability ∑q|⟨1 m&#39;;1 q|0 0⟩|²=1/3, independent of m&#39;.  Thus the joint probability for each specific intermediate m&#39; is (1/3)(1/3)=1/9, and conditional on reaching |1,0,0&gt; via that route is (1/9)/(1/3)=1/3.  The choice listing the m&#39;=0 route with probability 1/3 is B).

### thinking by Debate Agent NM3J:
We need the branching probabilities for two successive electric‐dipole (E1) decays from |3,0,0&gt; (3s, m=0) to |1,0,0&gt; (1s) via an intermediate 2p state |2,1,m&gt;.  Selection rules Δℓ=±1, Δm=0,±1 allow three possible intermediate m=−1,0,+1.  The angular (Clebsch–Gordan) factors give equal strength for each m in the first step (|&lt;3,0;1,q|2,1&gt;|^2 ∝1 for q=m), and from each |2,1,m&gt; to |1,0,0&gt; likewise only one q=−m contributes with |&lt;2,1;m;1,−m|1,0&gt;|^2=1.  Hence each route has equal branching P=1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent nBp4:
We have 3s (n=3,l=0,m=0) decaying by two successive E1 steps through 2p (l&#39;=1,m&#39; = −1,0,+1) to 1s (l&#39;&#39;=0,m&#39;&#39;=0). For an unpolarized atom, the branching ratio into each 2p,m′ sublevel in the 3s→2p step is given by the square of the relevant Clebsch–Gordan coefficient, which yields 1/3 for each m′. Once in any 2p,m′ state, there is only one allowed ↦ 1s channel, so the overall probability for the cascade via m′=0 is 1/3.

### answer by Debate Agent QGSl:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent 5SKA:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent NM3J:
The three allowed two‐step dipole routes and their probabilities are:

1) \(|3,0,0\rangle\to|2,1,1\rangle\to|1,0,0\rangle,\quad P=1/3\)
2) \(|3,0,0\rangle\to|2,1,0\rangle\to|1,0,0\rangle,\quad P=1/3\)
3) \(|3,0,0\rangle\to|2,1,-1\rangle\to|1,0,0\rangle,\quad P=1/3\)

### answer by Debate Agent nBp4:
B)

    <pre>We have 3s (n=3,l=0,m=0) decaying via two E1 steps through 2p (l=1,m=−1,0,+1) to 1s (l=0,m=0). Selection rules Δl=±1, Δm=0,±1. The branching ratio for each 3s→2p,m′ transition is |⟨1,m′;1,q|0,0⟩|²=1/3, and for each 2p,m′→1s: |⟨1,m′;1,−m′|0,0⟩|²=1/3. Thus the conditional branching among the three two‐step routes is equal, giving 1/3 for each. The route via m′=0 is therefore
