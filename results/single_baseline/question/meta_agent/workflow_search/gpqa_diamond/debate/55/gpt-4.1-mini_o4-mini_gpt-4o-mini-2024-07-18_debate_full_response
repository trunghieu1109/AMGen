From |3,0,0⟩ the first dipole transition populates |2,1,m⟩ with probabilities proportional to |C(0,0;1,q|1,m)|^2=1/3 for m=0,±1. The only route that leads to |1,0,0⟩ with Δm total=0 is via m=0, giving the dominant branch |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with branching ratio 1/3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5SKA:\nWe consider spontaneous dipole transitions from |3,0,0> (l=0,m=0) to |2,1,m'> then to |1,0,0>.  The first step branches equally among m'=−1,0,1 (each 1/3).  The second step from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0> has probability ∑q|⟨1 m';1 q|0 0⟩|²=1/3, independent of m'.  Thus the joint probability for each specific intermediate m' is (1/3)(1/3)=1/9, and conditional on reaching |1,0,0> via that route is (1/9)/(1/3)=1/3.  The choice listing the m'=0 route with probability 1/3 is B).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent NM3J:\nWe need the branching probabilities for two successive electric‐dipole (E1) decays from |3,0,0> (3s, m=0) to |1,0,0> (1s) via an intermediate 2p state |2,1,m>.  Selection rules Δℓ=±1, Δm=0,±1 allow three possible intermediate m=−1,0,+1.  The angular (Clebsch–Gordan) factors give equal strength for each m in the first step (|<3,0;1,q|2,1>|^2 ∝1 for q=m), and from each |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> likewise only one q=−m contributes with |<2,1;m;1,−m|1,0>|^2=1.  Hence each route has equal branching P=1/3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent nBp4:\nWe have 3s (n=3,l=0,m=0) decaying by two successive E1 steps through 2p (l'=1,m'\u2009=\u2009−1,0,+1) to 1s (l''=0,m''=0). For an unpolarized atom, the branching ratio into each 2p,m′ sublevel in the 3s→2p step is given by the square of the relevant Clebsch–Gordan coefficient, which yields 1/3 for each m′. Once in any 2p,m′ state, there is only one allowed ↦\u20091s channel, so the overall probability for the cascade via m′=0 is 1/3.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent QGSl:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5SKA:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NM3J:\nThe three allowed two‐step dipole routes and their probabilities are:\n\n1) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,1\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle,\\quad P=1/3\\)\n2) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,0\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle,\\quad P=1/3\\)\n3) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,-1\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle,\\quad P=1/3\\)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent nBp4:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
