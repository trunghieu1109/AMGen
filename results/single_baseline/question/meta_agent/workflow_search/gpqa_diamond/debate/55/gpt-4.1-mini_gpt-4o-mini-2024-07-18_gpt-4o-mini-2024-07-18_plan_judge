proposed answer: After analyzing the provided choices and considering the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the valid transition route from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ must involve an intermediate state with l=1. The only valid intermediate state that satisfies the selection rules is |2,1,0⟩, leading to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The corresponding probability for this transition is given as \frac{1}{3}, which is consistent with the rules of quantum mechanics governing such transitions. Therefore, the correct answer is the transition route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and the probability \frac{1}{3}.

Answer:The transition route is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and the probability is \frac{1}{3}.
Extracted answer: The transition route is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and the probability is \frac{1}{3}.
