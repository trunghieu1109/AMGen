        "response": "After analyzing the provided choices and considering the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the valid transition route from the state |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 must involve an intermediate state with l=1. The only valid intermediate state that satisfies the selection rules is |2,1,0\u27e9, leading to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9. The corresponding probability for this transition is given as \\frac{1}{3}, which is consistent with the rules of quantum mechanics governing such transitions. Therefore, the correct answer is the transition route |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 and the probability \\frac{1}{3}.\n\nAnswer:The transition route is |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 and the probability is \\frac{1}{3}.",
