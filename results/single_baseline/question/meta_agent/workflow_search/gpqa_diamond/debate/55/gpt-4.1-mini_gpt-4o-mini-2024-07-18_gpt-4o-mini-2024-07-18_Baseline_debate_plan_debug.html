### thinking by Debate Agent 5SKA:
To determine the correct decay route and probability for the transition from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions, we need to consider the allowed transitions based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The possible intermediate states must have a change in the principal quantum number (n) and can change the azimuthal quantum number (l) by ±1 and the magnetic quantum number (m) by ±1. After analyzing the given choices, it appears that choice 2 provides a valid transition route and a reasonable probability.

### thinking by Debate Agent NM3J:
To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of the state |3,0,0\rangle to |1,0,0\rangle via two dipole transitions, we need to consider the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The allowed transitions must satisfy the change in angular momentum and magnetic quantum number. The initial state has quantum numbers n=3, l=0, m=0 and the final state has n=1, l=0, m=0. The intermediate state must have l=1 (since l can change by ±1 for dipole transitions) and m can take values -1, 0, or +1. Therefore, the intermediate states |2,1,1\rangle, |2,1,0\rangle, and |2,1,-1\rangle are valid options. We also need to consider the probabilities associated with these transitions. The probabilities given in the choices need to be evaluated based on the allowed transitions. After analyzing the options provided, the correct transition route and its corresponding probability is found to be |3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle and \frac{1}{3}.

### thinking by Debate Agent nBp4:
To determine the correct transition route and corresponding probability for the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state, we need to consider the allowed dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions dictate that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) must be ±1 and the change in the magnetic quantum number (m) must be 0 or ±1. Starting from |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0), the only allowable intermediate state with l=1 is |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, or 1. The final state must be |1,0,0⟩. The probabilities for each transition route must also be assessed based on the given choices. After analyzing the options, the correct route is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, which corresponds to a probability of 1/3, as it adheres to the selection rules and is a valid transition pathway.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0Imc:
To determine the correct transition route and corresponding probability for the decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, we must consider the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The allowed transitions must satisfy the change in quantum numbers based on these rules. The transition probabilities must also be evaluated. The options provided need to be analyzed for validity based on these rules.

    <pre>After analyzing the provided choices and considering the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the valid transition route from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ must involve an intermediate state with l=1. The only valid intermediate state that satisfies the selection rules is |2,1,0⟩, leading to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The corresponding probability for this transition is given as \frac{1}{3}, which is consistent with the rules of quantum mechanics governing such transitions. Therefore, the correct answer is the transition route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and the probability \frac{1}{3}.

Answer:The transition route is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and the probability is \frac{1}{3}.</pre>
