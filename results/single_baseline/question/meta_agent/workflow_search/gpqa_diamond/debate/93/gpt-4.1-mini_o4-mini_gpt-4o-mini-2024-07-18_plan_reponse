A bimolecular Diels\u2013Alder between 1-vinylcyclohex-1-ene (an internal/exocyclic diene) and methyl hex-2-ynoate (an alkynyl ester bearing a propyl tail) directly assembles the bicyclic skeleton with the correct substituents, which upon hydrogenation yields the octahydro product. The other choices lack the needed pairing of a cyclic diene and an alkynyl ester or require less feasible intramolecular cyclizations for this substitution pattern.\n\nAnswer:A)",
