            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "All agents agree that the problem involves a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is given by the formula omega = gamma*B, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is gamma*B. All agents have concluded that the correct choice is B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
