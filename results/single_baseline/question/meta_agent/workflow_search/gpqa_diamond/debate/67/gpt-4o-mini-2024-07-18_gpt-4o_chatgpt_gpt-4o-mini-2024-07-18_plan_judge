Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the z-component of the particle's moment starts to oscillate due to the change in the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of oscillation of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma*B, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. All agents agree that the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s moment is gamma*B, which corresponds to choice B).
