            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",
