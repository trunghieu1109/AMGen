Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In this scenario, the spin 1/2 particle's magnetic moment precesses around the new magnetic field direction after the field is switched from +Z to +Y. The frequency of this precession is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is given by omega = gamma * B. Since the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment will also be gamma * B. Therefore, the correct choice is 'gamma*B'.
