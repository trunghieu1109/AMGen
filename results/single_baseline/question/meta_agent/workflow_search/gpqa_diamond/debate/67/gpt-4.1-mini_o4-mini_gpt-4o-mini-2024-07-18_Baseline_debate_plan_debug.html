    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;gamma*B/2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;gamma*B&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;gamma*B/sqrt(2)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;sqrt(2)*gamma*B&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent I2Kk:
We have a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment μ = γSz. Initially the spin is aligned along +Z by a static B-field. At t=0 the field is switched to point along +Y with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian becomes H = -μ·B = -γSyB, so the spin precesses about the Y-axis at the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The expectation value ⟨Sz⟩ then oscillates as ⟨Sz⟩∝cos(ωt) with frequency ω = γB.

### thinking by Debate Agent p9s1:
The spin-½ particle initially is in an eigenstate of S_z with B along +Z. When the field is suddenly switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ S·B = -γ B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(iγB S_y t/ħ). Acting on the initial |↑_z⟩ state, the expectation value ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩cos(γB t) oscillates with angular frequency ω = γB. Hence the oscillation frequency is γB.

### thinking by Debate Agent XUSW:
The particle is initially in the Sz=+ħ/2 eigenstate (aligned along +Z). When the field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=–γB Sy. Time evolution is a rotation about Y with angular frequency ω=γB (from U=exp(–iH t/ħ)=exp(–iγB Sy t/ħ)=rotation by angle φ=γB t). The expectation ⟨Sz⟩(t)= (ħ/2)cos(φ) thus oscillates at frequency ω=γB.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0dkF:
The Hamiltonian after the field is switched to the y-direction is H=−γB Sy, so the spin precesses about y with angular frequency ω=γB. The z-component then oscillates as ⟨Sz⟩∝cos(ωt) with ω=γB.
