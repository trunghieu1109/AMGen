            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "In this scenario, the spin 1/2 particle's magnetic moment precesses around the new magnetic field direction after the field is switched from +Z to +Y. The frequency of this precession is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is given by omega = gamma * B. Since the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment will also be gamma * B. Therefore, the correct choice is 'gamma*B'.\n\nAnswer:B",
