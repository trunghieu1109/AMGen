Initially the spin is aligned along +Z by a static B-field. At t=0 the field is switched to point along +Y with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian becomes H = -μ·B = -γSyB, so the spin precesses about the Y-axis at the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The expectation value ⟨Sz⟩ then oscillates as ⟨Sz⟩∝cos(ωt) with frequency ω = γB.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent p9s1:\nThe spin-½ particle initially is in an eigenstate of S_z with B along +Z. When the field is suddenly switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ S·B = -γ B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(iγB S_y t/ħ). Acting on the initial |↑_z⟩ state, the expectation value ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨S_z(0)⟩cos(γB t) oscillates with angular frequency ω = γB. Hence the oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent XUSW:\nThe particle is initially in the Sz=+ħ/2 eigenstate (aligned along +Z). When the field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=–γB\u2009Sy. Time evolution is a rotation about Y with angular frequency ω=γB (from U=exp(–iH\u2009t/ħ)=exp(–iγB\u2009Sy\u2009t/ħ)=rotation by angle φ=γB\u2009t). The expectation ⟨Sz⟩(t)= (ħ/2)cos(φ) thus oscillates at frequency ω=γB.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 0dkF:\nThe Hamiltonian after the field is switched to the y-direction is H=−γB\u2009Sy, so the spin precesses about y with angular frequency ω=γB. The z-component then oscillates as ⟨Sz⟩∝cos(ωt) with ω=γB.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent I2Kk:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent p9s1:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent XUSW:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 0dkF:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
