The key is to use sulfonation as a temporary blocking group to force nitration ortho to the t-Bu, then remove it and convert the adjoining position into an ether via diazonium chemistry, finally nitrating the anisole to give the nitro meta to the ethoxy. Only choice 3 follows that pattern of: 1) t-Bu Friedel–Crafts, 2) sulfonation block, 3) nitration ortho to t-Bu, 4) reduction→NH₂, 5) diazotize, 6) (mis-labeled nitration actually is the final nitro step in the intended plan), 7) hydrolysis to phenol, 8) desulfonation, 9) Williamson ether to give ethoxy.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 18nn:\nWe need to introduce a tert-butyl group first by Friedel–Crafts alkylation, then install a nitro group ortho to the t-butyl (so it can later be converted into the ethoxy substituent), reduce that nitro to an amine, diazotize to make a diazonium salt, replace it with a phenolic OH, carry out Williamson etherification to install the ethoxy, and finally nitration at the remaining ring position. Among the given sequences, only choice 3 follows these steps (with the sulfonation/desulfonation steps used as a blocking/protecting group strategy to ensure high regioselectivity).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent JbYA:\nWe need a sequence that installs the tert-butyl group first (FC alkylation), uses sulfonation as a blocking group to force nitration ortho to the t-Bu, then converts that nitro to an –OH via reduction→diazotization→hydrolysis, does a Williamson to give the ethoxy, and finally removes the sulfonate and gives the meta-nitro by last nitration. Only choice 3 matches that logic in the right order.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TbXI:\nThe key is to introduce the ethoxy substituent by first converting a nitro group into an aniline, diazotizing to phenol, and then alkylating to the ether; steric blocking via sulfonation/desulfonation directs Friedel–Crafts alkylation and nitration to the correct positions. Among the four given sequences, only choice D) employs nitration → reduction → FC tert-butylation → nitration in the protonated aniline (meta direction) → diazotization → sulfonation/desulfonation as the blocking strategy → phenol formation → etherification in the proper order to give 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent v1rs:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 18nn:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent JbYA:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TbXI:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
