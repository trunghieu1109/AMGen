### thinking by Debate Agent v1rs:
We need to install a tert-butyl at C-2 and an ethoxy at C-1, then introduce a nitro meta to the ethoxy (i.e. at C-3). The key is to use sulfonation as a temporary blocking group to force nitration ortho to the t-Bu, then remove it and convert the adjoining position into an ether via diazonium chemistry, finally nitrating the anisole to give the nitro meta to the ethoxy. Only choice 3 follows that pattern of: 1) t-Bu Friedel–Crafts, 2) sulfonation block, 3) nitration ortho to t-Bu, 4) reduction→NH₂, 5) diazotize, 6) (mis-labeled nitration actually is the final nitro step in the intended plan), 7) hydrolysis to phenol, 8) desulfonation, 9) Williamson ether to give ethoxy.

### thinking by Debate Agent 18nn:
We need to introduce a tert-butyl group first by Friedel–Crafts alkylation, then install a nitro group ortho to the t-butyl (so it can later be converted into the ethoxy substituent), reduce that nitro to an amine, diazotize to make a diazonium salt, replace it with a phenolic OH, carry out Williamson etherification to install the ethoxy, and finally nitration at the remaining ring position. Among the given sequences, only choice 3 follows these steps (with the sulfonation/desulfonation steps used as a blocking/protecting group strategy to ensure high regioselectivity).

### thinking by Debate Agent JbYA:
We need a sequence that installs the tert-butyl group first (FC alkylation), uses sulfonation as a blocking group to force nitration ortho to the t-Bu, then converts that nitro to an –OH via reduction→diazotization→hydrolysis, does a Williamson to give the ethoxy, and finally removes the sulfonate and gives the meta-nitro by last nitration. Only choice 3 matches that logic in the right order.

### thinking by Debate Agent TbXI:
The key is to introduce the ethoxy substituent by first converting a nitro group into an aniline, diazotizing to phenol, and then alkylating to the ether; steric blocking via sulfonation/desulfonation directs Friedel–Crafts alkylation and nitration to the correct positions. Among the four given sequences, only choice D) employs nitration → reduction → FC tert-butylation → nitration in the protonated aniline (meta direction) → diazotization → sulfonation/desulfonation as the blocking strategy → phenol formation → etherification in the proper order to give 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.

    <pre>The optimal route uses tert‐butylation, sulfonation as a blocking group to direct the first nitration ortho to the tert‐butyl, reduction to the amine, diazotization and hydrolysis to phenol, Williamson etherification to install the ethoxy, desulfonation to remove the blocking group, and a final nitration to give the nitro adjacent to both the tert‐butyl and ethoxy. Only choice 3 (C) follows this logic in the correct order of steps.
