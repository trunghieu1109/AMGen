Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole using its angular size and distance. The angular size θ and distance d can be used to estimate the Schwarzschild radius r_s, which is related to the mass M of the black hole. The entropy S of a black hole is proportional to the square of its mass (S ∝ M^2). The angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees and distance d = 10^10 parsecs allow us to estimate the mass M using the relation θ = (2GM/c^2) / d. Once M is estimated, the entropy can be calculated using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The debate agents have provided different answers, but the majority suggest D) 10^66 J/K. This is consistent with the understanding that the entropy of a supermassive black hole is extremely large, and the order of magnitude 10^66 J/K is reasonable given the scale of the problem.
