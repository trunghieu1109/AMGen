        "response": "All agents agree on the approach to calculate the entropy of the black hole using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. They correctly identify the need to calculate the Schwarzschild radius from the angular size and distance, and then use it to find the area of the event horizon. The entropy is then calculated from the area. All agents independently arrive at the same choice, C), indicating a consensus on the order of magnitude of the entropy.\n\nAnswer:C)",
