        "response": "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole, we utilize the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for black hole entropy, which relates the entropy to the area of the event horizon. The area can be calculated from the Schwarzschild radius, which is derived from the mass of the black hole. The mass can be estimated using the angular size and distance provided. After performing the necessary calculations and considering the choices given, the most consistent and reasonable estimate for the entropy of a supermassive black hole of this scale is 10^65 J/K, as supported by multiple analyses.\n\nAnswer:B",
