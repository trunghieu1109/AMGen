            "In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?",
            "loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype",
            "protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype",
            "protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele",
            "change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype",

        "response": "In this scenario, mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor. A dominant-negative mutation typically disrupts the function of the wild-type protein, particularly by interfering with dimerization. Since dimerization is crucial for the transcription factor's function, the presence of mutation Y is likely to lead to a loss of function of the wild-type allele. The most plausible molecular phenotype associated with mutation Y would be 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', as the mutant protein could destabilize the dimer formed with the wild-type protein, leading to degradation and loss of function. Therefore, the correct choice is C.\n\nAnswer:C",
