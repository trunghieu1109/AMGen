Question: {'question': 'In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation.

This results in an overall loss-of-function phenotype even in the presence of one wild-type allele.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent pvww:\nA dominant-negative mutation typically produces a mutant protein that can still dimerize with the wild-type subunit but renders the entire complex nonfunctional, often by sequestering the wild-type into inactive aggregates. Choice 2 describes this mechanism.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6xb7:\nA dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain produces mutant subunits that still interact with wild-type subunits but render the entire complex nonfunctional. This often manifests as formation of mixed, inactive dimers or higher-order aggregates that sequester the wild-type protein, leading to loss of function even in heterozygotes. Choice 2 describes protein aggregation with loss-of-function, matching the dominant-negative effect.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent KtXb:\nDominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains typically allow mutant protein to dimerize with wild-type but form nonfunctional complexes, often leading to aggregation of the mutantâ€“wild-type heteromers and loss-of-function. This explains how a heterozygous dimerization-domain mutation can inhibit the wild-type protein. Thus the observed phenotype is protein aggregation with loss-of-function.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent uBvt:\nB\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pvww:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6xb7:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KtXb:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
