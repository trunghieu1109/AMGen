    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Y2k:
Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. For each compound:
1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound can have a chiral axis due to the biphenyl structure, potentially showing optical isomerism.
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon with the hydroxy group), showing optical isomerism.
3. Benzophenone: This compound is symmetrical and lacks a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.
4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound has a symmetrical structure (trans isomer), and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.
Therefore, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent OYu9:
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Let&#39;s analyze each compound: 

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound could potentially show optical isomerism if it has chiral centers, but biphenyls often exhibit optical activity when the two rings cannot freely rotate due to steric hindrance, which is possible here.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is a simple ester of lactic acid, which is known to have a chiral center, thus it shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers, so it does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is a trans isomer, and does not have chiral centers, so it does not show optical isomerism.

Based on this analysis, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent fXip:
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, typically a carbon atom with four different groups attached to it. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound can potentially show optical isomerism if there is a chiral center, but biphenyl compounds often show optical isomerism due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the phenyl rings if substituents are present in ortho positions, which can create chirality.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group), which makes it capable of optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center as it is symmetrical and lacks the necessary structural complexity for optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is a geometric isomer (a type of stereoisomer) but does not have a chiral center, thus it does not show optical isomerism.

Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent lhPp:
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. 
1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound has a biphenyl structure which can exhibit chirality if the rotation around the single bond is restricted, but typically biphenyls need ortho-substituents to show chirality, which is not mentioned here.
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the 2nd carbon due to the hydroxyl and ester groups, making it optically active.
3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center; it is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.
4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is a trans isomer, and while it can have geometric isomers, it does not have chiral centers for optical isomerism.
Thus, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) shows optical isomerism.
