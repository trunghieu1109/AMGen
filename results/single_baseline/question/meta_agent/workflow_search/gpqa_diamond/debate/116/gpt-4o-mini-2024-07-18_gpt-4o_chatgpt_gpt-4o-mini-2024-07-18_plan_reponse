            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, typically carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Let's evaluate the options: 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate has two phenyl rings which can introduce chirality if there are substitutions on the rings in a way that makes them non-superimposable. However, without specific substitutions that create chirality, this compound may not show optical isomerism. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group, the methyl group, and the carboxylate group, making it optically active. 3. Benzophenone lacks chiral centers as it is a symmetrical compound with no four different groups attached to any carbon. 4. Dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical compound and does not have chiral centers. Based on this analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
