Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: After analyzing the compounds for the presence of chiral centers, it is clear that only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. The other compounds either lack chiral centers or do not show optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer must include methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The options that include this compound are '1 and 2' and '1, 2 and 4'. However, since only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, the correct choice is '1 and 2'.

Answer:1 and 2
Extracted answer: 1 and 2
Correct answer: 2
