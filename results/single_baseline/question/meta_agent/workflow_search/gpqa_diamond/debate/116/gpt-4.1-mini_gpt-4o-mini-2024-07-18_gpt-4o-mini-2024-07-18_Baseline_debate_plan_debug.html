    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent Yu9f:
To determine which of the listed organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or if they can exist as non-superimposable mirror images. Optical isomerism typically occurs in compounds with at least one chiral carbon atom. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound has multiple substituents and does not have a chiral center, thus it does not show optical isomerism.
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, so it does show optical isomerism.
3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center and therefore does not show optical isomerism.
4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound has a cis/trans isomerism but does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent Xipl:
To determine which organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or are capable of existing as non-superimposable mirror images. Optical isomerism typically occurs in compounds that have at least one chiral center. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate**: This compound does not have a chiral center due to the symmetry of the biphenyl system.
2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group), allowing for optical isomerism.
3. **Benzophenone**: This compound lacks a chiral center and is not capable of optical isomerism.
4. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound has a double bond and can exist in two geometric forms (cis and trans), but it does not have a chiral center, thus does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes this compound.

### thinking by Debate Agent hPpX:
To determine which organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify the presence of chiral centers in each compound. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom that is bonded to four different substituents. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate**: This compound has multiple substituents and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.
2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound has one chiral center (the carbon with the hydroxyl group), and it shows optical isomerism.
3. **Benzophenone**: This compound does not have a chiral center and does not show optical isomerism.
4. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate and has a chiral center, thus it shows optical isomerism.

From this analysis, only compounds 2 and 4 show optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;.

### thinking by Debate Agent V7W9:
To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they contain a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound has no chiral centers due to symmetry in the biphenyl structure.
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, making it optically active.
3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers and is not optically active.
4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound has a double bond between two carbons, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans) but not optical isomerism as it lacks a chiral center.

From the analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

    <pre>After analyzing the compounds for the presence of chiral centers, it is clear that only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. The other compounds either lack chiral centers or do not show optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer must include methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The options that include this compound are &#39;1 and 2&#39; and &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;. However, since only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, the correct choice is &#39;1 and 2&#39;.
