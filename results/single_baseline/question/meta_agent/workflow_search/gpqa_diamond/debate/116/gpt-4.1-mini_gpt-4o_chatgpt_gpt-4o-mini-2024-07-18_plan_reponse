            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Analyzing each compound: 1) Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate can show optical isomerism due to restricted rotation in biphenyls with appropriate substituents. 2) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon, showing optical isomerism. 3) Benzophenone is symmetrical and lacks a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism. 4) Dimethyl fumarate is a trans isomer and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism. Therefore, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\nAnswer:B)",
