    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Y2k:
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, typically carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Let&#39;s evaluate the options: 1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate has two phenyl rings which can introduce chirality if there are substitutions on the rings in a way that makes them non-superimposable. However, without specific substitutions that create chirality, this compound may not show optical isomerism. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group, the methyl group, and the carboxylate group, making it optically active. 3. Benzophenone lacks chiral centers as it is a symmetrical compound with no four different groups attached to any carbon. 4. Dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical compound and does not have chiral centers. Based on this analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent OYu9:
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound contains a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom with four different groups attached. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound might show optical isomerism if it has a chiral center, but biphenyl compounds can also show optical activity due to restricted rotation around the bond connecting the two phenyl rings if the substituents are not symmetric.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon with the hydroxyl group), so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is a derivative of fumaric acid and does not have a chiral center. It is a geometric isomer (cis-trans isomerism) but not an optical isomer.

Based on this analysis, compounds 1 and 2 can show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Let&#39;s analyze each compound: 
1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate may have chiral centers due to the biphenyl structure if the substituents allow for non-planar conformation, but it&#39;s not guaranteed.
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon, making it optically active.
3. Benzophenone is a planar molecule and does not have chiral centers, so it does not show optical isomerism.
4. Dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical molecule with no chiral centers, so it does not show optical isomerism.
Based on this analysis, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) shows optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent lhPp:
Optical isomerism, a type of stereoisomerism, occurs when compounds have chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Let&#39;s analyze each compound: 1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound may have chiral centers due to the biphenyl structure, but without specific substituent orientation, it&#39;s unclear. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Known as methyl lactate, it has a chiral center at the second carbon, allowing optical isomerism. 3. Benzophenone: Lacks a chiral center, so it doesn&#39;t show optical isomerism. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is not chiral; it is a geometric isomer. Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.
