    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1 and 2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1, 2 and 4&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Y2k:
Optical isomerism requires a chiral center or restricted rotation leading to non-superimposable mirror images. 
1) dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate is a substituted biphenyl with ortho substituents restricting rotation (atropisomerism) → chiral.
2) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereocenter at the hydroxy-bearing carbon → chiral.
3) benzophenone is symmetric and achiral.
4) dimethyl fumarate is an achiral alkene (E isomer) with no stereocenter.
Thus only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

### thinking by Debate Agent OYu9:
We need to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism (chirality). 1 is a sterically hindered biphenyl with ortho substituents, leading to atropisomerism (axial chirality). 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate), which has a stereogenic center at C-2. 3 (benzophenone) has no stereogenic center or chiral axis. 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is an E-alkene with symmetry, so achiral. Thus only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, corresponding to choice2, which is B).

### thinking by Debate Agent fXip:
Optical isomerism arises from chirality centers or axial chirality. 1) The biphenyl derivative has bulky ortho substituents (2,2′-dicarboxylate and 6,6′-dinitro) that hinder rotation, leading to atropisomerism (axial chirality). 2) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic carbon bearing –OH, –CO2Me, –CH3, and –H. 3) Benzophenone has no chiral center or axis. 4) Dimethyl fumarate is a trans alkene without chirality. Therefore, only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, corresponding to choice B).

### thinking by Debate Agent lhPp:
We need to identify which compounds show optical activity (chiral molecules or atropisomers).

1. dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: The ortho substituents on the biphenyl ring create hindered rotation, giving rise to axial chirality (atropisomerism).
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate): Contains a chiral center at the carbon bearing OH, H, CH3, and COOCH3.
3. benzophenone: Achiral, with a plane of symmetry; no optical isomerism.
4. dimethyl fumarate: A trans alkene with identical substituents on each carbon; achiral.

Therefore, only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, corresponding to choice2.

    <pre>Optical isomerism arises from chirality. Compound 1 (hindered biphenyl) has restricted rotation producing axial chirality (atropisomerism). Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) contains a stereogenic center. Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) are achiral. Therefore only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.
