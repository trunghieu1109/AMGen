Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Optical isomerism arises from chirality. Compound 1 (hindered biphenyl) has restricted rotation producing axial chirality (atropisomerism). Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) contains a stereogenic center. Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) are achiral. Therefore only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.
