            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",

        "response": "To determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B, we analyze the information provided about the reactions and the gases produced. The increase in weight of tube \u21161 indicates the absorption of water vapor by Mg(ClO4)2, while the increase in tube \u21163 indicates the formation of CuO from a gas containing oxygen. The fact that tube \u21162 did not change suggests that no acidic gas was present to react with Ca(OH)2. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, which is split between A and B. By considering the possible compositions of salts A and B and their atomic contributions, we can estimate the total number of atoms. After careful consideration of the reactions and the stoichiometry involved, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is determined to be 19, which corresponds to the correct choice based on the analysis of the reactions and the gases produced.\n\nAnswer:D",
