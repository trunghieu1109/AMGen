            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",

        "response": "The problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that decomposes to form gases when heated. The gases are passed through three tubes, each with a specific function. Tube #1 absorbs water, indicating 3.60 g of water was formed. Tube #3 forms CuO, indicating 0.80 g of oxygen was involved. Tube #2 did not change weight, indicating no CO2 was present. The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, equivalent to 0.1 mol. The total mass of gases absorbed and remaining is 4.40 g, with the remaining gas C likely being a simple diatomic gas like H2. The salts A and B must have contained elements that resulted in the formation of H2O, O2, and H2. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be deduced by considering the stoichiometry and the composition of the gases formed. Given the equimolar nature and the formation of these gases, the salts likely contained a total of 13 atoms. Therefore, the most consistent answer with the given data and reasoning is 13 atoms.\n\nAnswer:B)",
