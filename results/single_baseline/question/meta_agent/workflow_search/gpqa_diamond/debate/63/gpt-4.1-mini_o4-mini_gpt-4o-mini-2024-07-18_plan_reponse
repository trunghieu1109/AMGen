            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",

        "response": "We have an equimolar mixture of two salts A and B (n moles each, total mass 7.20 g). Heating to 200 \u00b0C (no air) gives only gaseous products. Passing the hot gases through: (1) anhydrous Mg(ClO\u2084)\u2082 traps H\u2082O, mass gain 3.60 g \u21d2 0.200 mol H\u2082O; (2) Ca(OH)\u2082 solution traps CO\u2082, no weight change \u21d2 no CO\u2082; (3) red\u2010hot Cu oxidizes O\u2082 to CuO, mass gain 0.80 g \u21d2 0.025 mol O\u2082. Remaining gas (2.24 L at STP) is 0.100 mol and inert \u21d2 N\u2082. Thus decomposition yields H\u2082O 0.200 mol, O\u2082 0.025 mol, N\u2082 0.100 mol. The simplest salts fitting these stoichiometries are A = NH\u2084NO\u2082 \u2192 N\u2082 + 2 H\u2082O and B = NH\u2084NO\u2083 \u2192 N\u2082O + 2 H\u2082O. On heating without air, ammonium nitrate can decompose to N\u2082 + 2 H\u2082O + \u00bc O\u2082, matching the small amount of O\u2082. Taking n = 0.050 mol of each: H\u2082O = 2n + 2n = 0.200 mol; O\u2082 = 0.25n = 0.0125 mol\u2014but this is half of needed. A more accurate mechanism involves partial decomposition of NH\u2084NO\u2083 to N\u2082O + 2 H\u2082O (giving 0.050 mol N\u2082O \u2192 yields 0.025 mol O\u2082 with Cu). This fits all data with n=0.050 mol for each salt. The formulas have atom counts: NH\u2084NO\u2082 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms; NH\u2084NO\u2083 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms; total = 8 + 9 = 17 atoms.\n\nAnswer:C)",
