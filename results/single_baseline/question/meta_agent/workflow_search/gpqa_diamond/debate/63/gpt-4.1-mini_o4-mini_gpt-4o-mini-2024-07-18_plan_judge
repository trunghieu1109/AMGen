Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We have an equimolar mixture of two salts A and B (n moles each, total mass 7.20 g). Heating to 200 °C (no air) gives only gaseous products. Passing the hot gases through: (1) anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ traps H₂O, mass gain 3.60 g ⇒ 0.200 mol H₂O; (2) Ca(OH)₂ solution traps CO₂, no weight change ⇒ no CO₂; (3) red‐hot Cu oxidizes O₂ to CuO, mass gain 0.80 g ⇒ 0.025 mol O₂. Remaining gas (2.24 L at STP) is 0.100 mol and inert ⇒ N₂. Thus decomposition yields H₂O 0.200 mol, O₂ 0.025 mol, N₂ 0.100 mol. The simplest salts fitting these stoichiometries are A = NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2 H₂O and B = NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2 H₂O. On heating without air, ammonium nitrate can decompose to N₂ + 2 H₂O + ¼ O₂, matching the small amount of O₂. Taking n = 0.050 mol of each: H₂O = 2n + 2n = 0.200 mol; O₂ = 0.25n = 0.0125 mol—but this is half of needed. A more accurate mechanism involves partial decomposition of NH₄NO₃ to N₂O + 2 H₂O (giving 0.050 mol N₂O → yields 0.025 mol O₂ with Cu). This fits all data with n=0.050 mol for each salt. The formulas have atom counts: NH₄NO₂ = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms; NH₄NO₃ = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms; total = 8 + 9 = 17 atoms.
