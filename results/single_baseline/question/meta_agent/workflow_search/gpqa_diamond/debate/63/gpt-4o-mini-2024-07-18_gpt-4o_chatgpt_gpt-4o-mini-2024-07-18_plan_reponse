            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",

        "response": "The problem involves the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B into gases that react with specific substances in a series of tubes. The increase in weight of tube 1 indicates water absorption, suggesting that the gas mixture contains water vapor. The increase in weight of tube 3 indicates the formation of CuO, suggesting the presence of an oxygen-containing gas. The unchanged weight of tube 2 suggests that no CO2 is present, as it would react with Ca(OH)2. The remaining gas C is likely an inert gas or a gas that doesn't react with the given reagents. The total mass of the gases absorbed in tubes 1 and 3 is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g. Since the initial mass of the salts is 7.20 g, the remaining mass for gas C is 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g. At STP, 2.24 liters of gas is 0.1 moles (since 22.4 L/mol is the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP). The molar mass of gas C is 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol, suggesting that gas C could be nitrogen (N2). Since the salts are equimolar, each salt contributes equally to the formation of the gases. The decomposition must account for the formation of water, oxygen, and potentially nitrogen. Given the weights and the molar volume, the stoichiometry and molar ratios must align with these observations. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be determined by considering the simplest formulae that fit these conditions. Based on the choices and the typical composition of salts, option C) 17 atoms seems plausible for a combination of atoms that would decompose to give the observed products.\n\nAnswer:C)",
