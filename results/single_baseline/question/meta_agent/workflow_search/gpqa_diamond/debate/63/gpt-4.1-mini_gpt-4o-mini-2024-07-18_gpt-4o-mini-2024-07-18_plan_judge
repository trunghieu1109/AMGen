Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B, we analyze the information provided about the reactions and the gases produced. The increase in weight of tube №1 indicates the absorption of water vapor by Mg(ClO4)2, while the increase in tube №3 indicates the formation of CuO from a gas containing oxygen. The fact that tube №2 did not change suggests that no acidic gas was present to react with Ca(OH)2. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, which is split between A and B. By considering the possible compositions of salts A and B and their atomic contributions, we can estimate the total number of atoms. After careful consideration of the reactions and the stoichiometry involved, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is determined to be 19, which corresponds to the correct choice based on the analysis of the reactions and the gases produced.
