    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;15&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;13&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;17&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;19&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 6cLs:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the reactions and determine the composition of salts A and B. The increase in mass of tube №1 indicates water absorption, suggesting that water was part of the gases released. The increase in mass of tube №3 indicates the formation of CuO, meaning oxygen was also released. Since the weight of tube №2 did not change, no CO2 was absorbed, indicating no carbonates were involved. The mixture of gases, therefore, likely included H2O and O2. The increase in mass of tube №1 (3.60 g) suggests the presence of 0.20 moles of water (since the molar mass of water is 18 g/mol). The increase in mass of tube №3 (0.80 g) suggests the presence of 0.025 moles of O2 (since the molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol). The remaining gas C (2.24 liters at STP) corresponds to 0.10 moles, which could be a diatomic gas like N2. Given the equimolar mixture of salts A and B, these salts likely contain elements that release these gases upon decomposition. Considering the stoichiometry and the possible salts, a likely combination could be ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and a simple oxide or hydroxide. The decomposition of NH4NO3 could release N2, H2O, and O2. The total number of atoms in NH4NO3 is 9 (1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O). If the other salt is a simple oxide or hydroxide, it would contribute a small number of atoms. The total number of atoms in salts A and B is likely 13 (9 from NH4NO3 and 4 from a simple oxide like CaO).

### thinking by Debate Agent hS8F:
The problem involves the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B into gases that react with specific substances in a series of tubes. The increase in weight of tube 1 indicates water absorption, suggesting that the gas mixture contains water vapor. The increase in weight of tube 3 indicates the formation of CuO, suggesting the presence of an oxygen-containing gas. The unchanged weight of tube 2 suggests that no CO2 is present, as it would react with Ca(OH)2. The remaining gas C is likely an inert gas or a gas that doesn&#39;t react with the given reagents. The total mass of the gases absorbed in tubes 1 and 3 is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g. Since the initial mass of the salts is 7.20 g, the remaining mass for gas C is 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g. At STP, 2.24 liters of gas is 0.1 moles (since 22.4 L/mol is the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP). The molar mass of gas C is 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol, suggesting that gas C could be nitrogen (N2). Since the salts are equimolar, each salt contributes equally to the formation of the gases. The decomposition must account for the formation of water, oxygen, and potentially nitrogen. Given the weights and the molar volume, the stoichiometry and molar ratios must align with these observations. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be determined by considering the simplest formulae that fit these conditions. Based on the choices and the typical composition of salts, option C) 17 atoms seems plausible for a combination of atoms that would decompose to give the observed products.

### thinking by Debate Agent vBzG:
The problem involves a thermal decomposition of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which produces gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, each with a specific purpose. Tube #1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water vapor, resulting in a mass increase of 3.60 g, indicating the formation of 0.20 moles of water (since 18 g/mol for water). Tube #2 with Ca(OH)2 solution does not show a mass change, implying no CO2 was absorbed, suggesting no CO2 was produced. Tube #3 with red-hot copper results in the formation of CuO, indicating the presence of 0.01 moles of oxygen (since 0.80 g increase corresponds to 0.01 moles of O2, as 32 g/mol for O2). The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.1 moles (since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP). Since the gases passed through the tubes, the only gas left is likely an inert gas or a gas that does not react with the setup, possibly nitrogen or a noble gas. The initial mixture of salts A and B decomposed to form these products. Considering the stoichiometry and the fact that the salts were equimolar, we can deduce that salts A and B together must account for the atoms in the products. The total number of atoms in the salts would include the atoms that contributed to forming water, oxygen, and the remaining gas. Based on the stoichiometry and the problem constraints, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.

### thinking by Debate Agent ze89:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the reactions occurring in the tubes and the information given. 

1. The mixture of salts A and B decomposes to form gases. The gases are passed through three tubes:
   - Tube №1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, indicating water vapor was part of the gas mixture.
   - Tube №2 with Ca(OH)2 does not change weight, indicating no CO2 was present in the gas mixture.
   - Tube №3 with red-hot copper forms CuO, indicating oxygen was present in the gas mixture.

2. The increase in weight of tube №1 by 3.60 g corresponds to the absorption of water (H2O).
3. The increase in weight of tube №3 by 0.80 g corresponds to the formation of CuO, indicating 0.80 g of oxygen was absorbed.

4. The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP. This volume corresponds to 0.1 moles of gas (since 1 mole of gas at STP occupies 22.4 L). Given that no CO2 is present, this likely corresponds to a diatomic gas like H2 or O2.

5. The total mass of gases absorbed and remaining is 3.60 g (H2O) + 0.80 g (O2) = 4.40 g. Thus, the mass of gas C is 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.

6. If gas C is H2, then 0.1 moles of H2 would weigh 0.2 g. If gas C is O2, then 0.1 moles of O2 would weigh 3.2 g. Since the calculated mass of gas C is 2.80 g, it suggests that gas C is not a pure substance but a mixture.

7. Assuming gas C is H2, the mass of hydrogen would be 0.2 g, and the remaining mass (2.80 g - 0.2 g = 2.60 g) could be due to other gases or impurities.

8. Given the above analysis and the fact that 0.80 g of oxygen was absorbed to form CuO, the original salts A and B must have decomposed to form H2O, O2, and potentially other gases that do not react with Ca(OH)2.

9. The problem asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B. Considering the stoichiometry and typical decomposition reactions, we can hypothesize salts like hydrates or peroxides that release H2O and O2.

10. Based on the choices and typical stoichiometry, salts could be something like Na2CO3·10H2O (sodium carbonate decahydrate) and Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), which can release H2O and O2.

11. Calculating the number of atoms in such salts:
    - Na2CO3·10H2O: 2 Na + 1 C + 3 O + 20 H + 10 O = 36 atoms
    - Na2O2: 2 Na + 2 O = 4 atoms
    - Total = 36 + 4 = 40 atoms (this is an example; the actual salts might differ).

12. However, given the choices, we need to match the total atom count to one of the available options. If we assume simpler salts or a different stoichiometry, the total number of atoms could align with one of the provided choices.

13. The most logical choice given the problem constraints and typical decomposition reactions would be 15 atoms, considering simple salts that decompose to H2O and O2.

14. Thus, the total number of all atoms in salts A and B is likely 15.
