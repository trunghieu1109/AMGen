Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: ESPRESSO on one 8 m UT achieves S/N≈10 per binned pixel in 1 h for objects down to about V≈16 mag.  Known magnitudes: Canopus V≈–0.7 (detectable), Polaris V≈2.0 (detectable).  For M_V=15 stars: m=15+5 log10(d/10 pc) gives 13.5 mag at 5 pc (detectable), 15 mag at 10 pc (detectable), 18.5 mag at 50 pc (too faint), 21.5 mag at 200 pc (too faint).  Total detectable targets = 4.
