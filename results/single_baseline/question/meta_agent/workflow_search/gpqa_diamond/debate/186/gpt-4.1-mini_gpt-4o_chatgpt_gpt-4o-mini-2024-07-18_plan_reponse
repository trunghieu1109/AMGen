            "How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.",

        "response": "To determine which stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitudes of the stars based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. The ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 for stars with apparent magnitudes up to around 16 in a 1-hour exposure. \n\n1. Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of -0.74, which is easily detectable.\n2. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of 1.98, which is also detectable.\n3. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 10 pc would have an apparent magnitude of 15, which is detectable.\n4. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 200 pc would have an apparent magnitude of 20.5, which is not detectable.\n5. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 5 pc would have an apparent magnitude of 14.24, which is detectable.\n6. A star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 50 pc would have an apparent magnitude of 19.5, which is not detectable.\n\nTherefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc, totaling 4 stars.\n\nAnswer:A)",
