Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. The formula to convert absolute magnitude (M) to apparent magnitude (m) is: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), where d is the distance in parsecs. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude results in a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. After analyzing the stars: Canopus and Polaris are detectable due to their brightness. The star at 5 pc is also detectable, while the stars at 10 pc and 200 pc are not detectable. Therefore, the total number of detectable stars is 3: Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc distance.
