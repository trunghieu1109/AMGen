            "How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.",

        "response": "To determine the detectability of each star using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and check if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The ESPRESSO is highly sensitive, but the apparent magnitude is crucial for determining detectability. \n\n1. Canopus is a bright star with an apparent magnitude of -0.74, which is easily detectable.\n2. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98, which is also detectable.\n3. For the star with an absolute magnitude of 15 mag at 10 pc: its apparent magnitude is the same as its absolute magnitude, 15 mag, which is detectable.\n4. For the star at 200 pc: its apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.505 mag, which is likely too faint for detection.\n5. For the star at 5 pc: its apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 - 0.753 = 14.247 mag, which is detectable.\n6. For the star at 50 pc: its apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 3.5 = 18.5 mag, which is likely undetectable.\n\nHence, stars a, b, c, and e are detectable, making a total of 4 stars.\n\nAnswer:A)",
