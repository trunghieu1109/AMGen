        "response": "Cyclohexanone enolized with LDA at \u201378 \u00b0C gives the kinetic (Z)\u2010enolate, which adds to benzaldehyde via a Zimmerman\u2013Traxler chair to give the syn-aldol \u03b2-hydroxy ketone (product 1). Treatment with excess DAST converts the benzylic OH to fluoride with inversion and the ketone to a geminal difluoride. The net outcome is a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl unit bearing a benzylic fluoromethyl group. Of the choices, only choice 2 has both the cyclohexane C-1 converted to CF2 and the benzylic center as CH(F)\u2013Ph, with the correct stereochemical inversion at the former alcohol carbon.\n\nAnswer:B)",
