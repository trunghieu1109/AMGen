Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.\n\n1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?', choice1='(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one', choice2='((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', choice3='(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', choice4='((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Cyclohexanone enolized with LDA at –78 °C gives the kinetic (Z)‐enolate, which adds to benzaldehyde via a Zimmerman–Traxler chair to give the syn-aldol β-hydroxy ketone (product 1). Treatment with excess DAST converts the benzylic OH to fluoride with inversion and the ketone to a geminal difluoride. The net outcome is a 2,2-difluorocyclohexyl unit bearing a benzylic fluoromethyl group. Of the choices, only choice 2 has both the cyclohexane C-1 converted to CF2 and the benzylic center as CH(F)–Ph, with the correct stereochemical inversion at the former alcohol carbon.
