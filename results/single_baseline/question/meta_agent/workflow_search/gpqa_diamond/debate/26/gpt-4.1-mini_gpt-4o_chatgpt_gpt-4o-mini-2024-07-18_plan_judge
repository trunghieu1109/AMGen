Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The scenario involves a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain, suggesting protein synthesis at the ribosome. The mention of 'sugar' implies glycosylation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. The phrase 'somewhat rough' suggests the rough ER, where ribosomes are attached. The nascent chain saying 'goodbye; I need to be on my way' indicates it is heading towards its final destination, likely for secretion. The most logical path for a nascent chain undergoing glycosylation and secretion is from the rough ER to the extracellular space. Therefore, the best choice is 'cytosol to the extracellular space', as the cytosol is where the ribosome is located, and the chain is heading to the extracellular space.
