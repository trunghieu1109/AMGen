Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle is the signal recognition particle (SRP). It binds the emerging nascent chain on a ribosome in the cytosol, pauses translation, and directs the complex to the rough ER for glycosylation (‘some sugar’). Secretory proteins then proceed through the secretory pathway to be released outside the cell.
