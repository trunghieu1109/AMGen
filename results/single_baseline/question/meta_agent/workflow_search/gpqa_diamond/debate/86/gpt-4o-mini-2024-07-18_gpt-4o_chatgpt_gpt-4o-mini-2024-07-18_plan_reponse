        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Aromatic protons typically appear in the 7-8 ppm range in 1H NMR. The presence of a carbonyl group, especially if it's an aldehyde, can result in a proton signal around 9-10 ppm. Choice 2 has a peak at 9.9 ppm, which is consistent with a proton near a carbonyl group, and peaks at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, which are consistent with aromatic protons. The other choices do not have signals in the expected regions for both aromatic and carbonyl-associated protons. Therefore, choice 2 is the most consistent with the described compound.\n\nAnswer:B)",
