        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The presence of a carbonyl group suggests a deshielded proton environment, typically appearing downfield in the NMR spectrum. Aromatic protons usually appear in the range of 7-8 ppm. The presence of a halogen can cause further deshielding. Among the choices, choice 2 has a peak at 9.9 ppm, which is likely due to the carbonyl group, and peaks in the aromatic region at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, consistent with aromatic protons. This matches the expected NMR data for the described compound.\n\nAnswer:B)",
