        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted benzene (C6H4) with a carbonyl and a halogen, totaling 8 carbons, which corresponds to a haloacetophenone. In the 1H NMR this gives an AA\u2032BB\u2032 aromatic pattern: two doublets (2H each) around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, plus an acetyl methyl singlet at ~2.3 ppm. This matches choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
