        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The expected 1H NMR data should show peaks in the aromatic region (6.0 to 8.0 ppm) due to the aromatic protons. The presence of a carbonyl group may lead to deshielding of nearby protons, but the aromatic protons will still dominate the spectrum. Among the choices, the one that shows peaks at 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d) is consistent with the expected chemical shifts for aromatic protons. The other choices either have peaks outside the aromatic region or do not fit the expected splitting patterns. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes the peaks at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, which corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)",
