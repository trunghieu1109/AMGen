### thinking by Debate Agent hd8V:
The compound is a di-substituted benzene with 8 carbons: 6 in the ring and 2 in a carbonyl substituent. FTIR shows carbonyl and aromatic–halogen, so the substituents are Cl and an acetyl group (COCH3), i.e. chloroacetophenone. A para disubstitution gives two sets of aromatic protons (2H each) showing as two doublets around δ7.6–7.8, and a methyl singlet around δ2.3. This matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent MIt3:
The compound is a di‐substituted benzene (6 C) with a carbonyl substituent (–COCH3, 2 additional C) and a halogen. No other C’s, so total C = 8. This matches an acetophenone derivative with a halogen on the ring (e.g. bromoacetophenone). The 1H NMR of p-bromoacetophenone shows two aromatic doublets (AA′BB′ system) each integrating to 2H at ca. 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, plus an acetyl methyl singlet at ca. 2.3 ppm (3H). Choice 4 matches these data.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0DnP:
A di-substituted benzene with 8 carbons total must be C6H4–COCH3 plus a halogen on the ring (acetyl group contributes 2 carbons). A para-bromoacetophenone gives an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern: two doublets (2H each) around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, and a methyl singlet near 2.3 ppm. This matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent T9Xf:
We have a di-substituted benzene (6 C) with total 8 C, so the substituents account for 2 C. FTIR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond, consistent with a haloacetophenone (Ar–COCH3 + halogen). The acetyl methyl gives a 3H singlet at ~2.3 ppm, and the para-substituted ring gives two 2H doublets at ~7.6 and ~7.8 ppm. This matches choice 4.
