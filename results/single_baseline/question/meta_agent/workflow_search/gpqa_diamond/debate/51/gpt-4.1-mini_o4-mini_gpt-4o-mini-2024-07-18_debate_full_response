Question: {'question': "Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å.

The energy difference ΔE corresponds to λ≈1448\u2009Å, so ΔE/k ≈ (hc/λ)/k ≈ 1.4388\u2009cm·K / (1.448×10⁻⁵\u2009cm) ≈ 9.94×10⁴\u2009K.\n\nThus the ratio of ratios is\nR₆₀₀₀/R₅₅₀₀ = exp[ΔE/k*(1/5500\u2009K − 1/6000\u2009K)]\n= exp[9.94×10⁴\u2009K*(1.8182×10⁻⁴ − 1.6667×10⁻⁴)]\n≈ exp[9.94×10⁴ * 1.515×10⁻⁵]\n≈ exp[1.506]\n≈ 4.5\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YBxV:\nUnder LTE, the level population ratio n2/n1∝exp[−ΔE/(kT)]. Here ΔE=hc/λ with λ≈1448Å gives ΔE/k≈9.94×10^4\u2009K. The ratio change R6000/R5500=exp[−ΔE/k(1/6000−1/5500)] = exp[+1.51]≈4.5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MqKR:\nThe ratio of atoms in two levels under LTE follows Boltzmann: N1/N2 ∝ exp[–ΔE/(kT)]. The transition corresponds to λ≈1448 Å so ΔE=hc/λ≈1.372×10⁻¹⁸ J≈8.56 eV. Then ΔE/k ≈ 8.56 eV/(8.617×10⁻5 eV/K) ≈ 99,300 K. The factor R(6000)/R(5500)=exp[ΔE/k (1/5500 – 1/6000)] = exp[99,300*(1/5500 – 1/6000)] ≈ exp(1.503) ≈4.5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ZPNK:\nWe want the factor by which the Boltzmann ratio N₂/N₁ changes between Teff=6000\u2009K (no spots) and Teff=5500\u2009K (with spots). In LTE, N₂/N₁ ∝ exp(–ΔE/kT). The level separation ΔE = hc/λ with λ=1448\u2009Å gives ΔE ≃1.37×10⁻¹⁸\u2009J. For T₁=6000\u2009K, –ΔE/(kT₁)=–1.37×10⁻¹⁸/(1.38×10⁻²³×6000)≈–16.5; for T₂=5500\u2009K, –ΔE/(kT₂)≈–18.0. The ratio of ratios is exp(–ΔE/kT₁)/exp(–ΔE/kT₂)=exp(1.5)≈4.5.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ko5x:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YBxV:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MqKR:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ZPNK:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
