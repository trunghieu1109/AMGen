            "Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.",

        "response": "All agents agree that the problem involves using the Boltzmann distribution to calculate the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels at different temperatures. The energy difference between the levels is calculated using the given wavelength. The factor by which the ratio changes is determined by comparing the ratios at 6000 K and 5500 K. All agents calculated this factor to be approximately 2.9.\n\nAnswer:A)",
