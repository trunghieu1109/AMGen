    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star&#39;s surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.9&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~4.5&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~7.8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~1.1&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent ko5x:
We want the factor by which the Boltzmann population ratio n2/n1 changes between Teff=6000 K (no spots) and Teff=5500 K (with spots).

In LTE, n2/n1 ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The energy difference ΔE corresponds to λ≈1448 Å, so ΔE/k ≈ (hc/λ)/k ≈ 1.4388 cm·K / (1.448×10⁻⁵ cm) ≈ 9.94×10⁴ K.

Thus the ratio of ratios is
R₆₀₀₀/R₅₅₀₀ = exp[ΔE/k*(1/5500 K − 1/6000 K)]
= exp[9.94×10⁴ K*(1.8182×10⁻⁴ − 1.6667×10⁻⁴)]
≈ exp[9.94×10⁴ * 1.515×10⁻⁵]
≈ exp[1.506]
≈ 4.5

### thinking by Debate Agent YBxV:
Under LTE, the level population ratio n2/n1∝exp[−ΔE/(kT)]. Here ΔE=hc/λ with λ≈1448Å gives ΔE/k≈9.94×10^4 K. The ratio change R6000/R5500=exp[−ΔE/k(1/6000−1/5500)] = exp[+1.51]≈4.5.

### thinking by Debate Agent MqKR:
The ratio of atoms in two levels under LTE follows Boltzmann: N1/N2 ∝ exp[–ΔE/(kT)]. The transition corresponds to λ≈1448 Å so ΔE=hc/λ≈1.372×10⁻¹⁸ J≈8.56 eV. Then ΔE/k ≈ 8.56 eV/(8.617×10⁻5 eV/K) ≈ 99,300 K. The factor R(6000)/R(5500)=exp[ΔE/k (1/5500 – 1/6000)] = exp[99,300*(1/5500 – 1/6000)] ≈ exp(1.503) ≈4.5.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZPNK:
We want the factor by which the Boltzmann ratio N₂/N₁ changes between Teff=6000 K (no spots) and Teff=5500 K (with spots). In LTE, N₂/N₁ ∝ exp(–ΔE/kT). The level separation ΔE = hc/λ with λ=1448 Å gives ΔE ≃1.37×10⁻¹⁸ J. For T₁=6000 K, –ΔE/(kT₁)=–1.37×10⁻¹⁸/(1.38×10⁻²³×6000)≈–16.5; for T₂=5500 K, –ΔE/(kT₂)≈–18.0. The ratio of ratios is exp(–ΔE/kT₁)/exp(–ΔE/kT₂)=exp(1.5)≈4.5.
