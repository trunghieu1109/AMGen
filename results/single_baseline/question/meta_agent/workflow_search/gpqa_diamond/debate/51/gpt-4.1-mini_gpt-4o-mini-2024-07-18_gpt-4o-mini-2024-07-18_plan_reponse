            "Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.",

        "response": "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we can use the Boltzmann distribution. The effective temperature decreases from 6000K to 5500K when spots are present. By calculating the ratio of populations for both temperatures using the energy difference corresponding to the wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, we find that the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. This is consistent across multiple analyses and calculations.\n\nAnswer:B)",
