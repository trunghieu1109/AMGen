            "In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. \u201cSuch combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\u201d\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?",

        "response": "After analyzing the statements regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using ethylene and a dual catalyst system, it is clear that the first statement, which claims that such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US, is the most definitive and relevant to the question. The other statements, while plausible, do not provide the same level of confirmation about the industrial application of these systems. Therefore, the first statement is the correct one.\n\nAnswer:A",
