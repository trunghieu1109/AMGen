### thinking by Debate Agent DIHY:
To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is E = γmc² - mc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor given by γ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²)). We first calculate γ for v = 0.96c, then calculate the mass of the nucleus Li (which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons), and finally calculate the energy. The closest answer from the options provided that matches this calculation is selected.

### thinking by Debate Agent vYeA:
To find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for a nucleus to travel at 0.96c, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²)). Given that v = 0.96c, we can calculate γ. Then, we need to determine the mass of the nucleus Li (which has 3 neutrons and 3 protons) and calculate the energy using the mass-energy equivalence. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 amu, which can be converted to GeV. After calculating the energy, we can compare it to the provided choices to find the closest match.

### thinking by Debate Agent vBZF:
To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) traveling at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. The total energy E is given by E = γmc^2, where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ can be calculated as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). For v = 0.96c, we can calculate γ and then find the total energy. The rest mass of Li with 3 neutrons needs to be calculated based on the atomic mass units (amu) and converted to GeV. After performing the calculations, we compare the results with the given choices to find the correct energy value.

### thinking by Debate Agent 91ht:
To determine the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic energy formula: E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Here, v = 0.96c. First, we calculate γ, then we need the mass of the nucleus to compute the energy. The mass of Li with 3 neutrons (Li-6) is approximately 6.015 amu. Using the conversion factor of 1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c², we can find the rest mass energy. Finally, we calculate the total energy and compare it with the given choices.
