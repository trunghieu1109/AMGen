Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the energy of the lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ = 1/sqrt(1-v²/c²) for v = 0.96c is approximately 3.57. The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units, which is about 5.6 GeV/c² (since 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c²). Therefore, the relativistic energy E = γ * rest mass energy = 3.57 * 5.6 GeV = 19.992 GeV. The closest choice to this calculated energy is 20.132 GeV.
