        "response": "To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) at a speed of 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 is calculated as \u03b3 = 1 / \u221a(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). For v = 0.96c, we find \u03b3. The mass of Li-6 (which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons) is approximately 6.015 amu. Converting this mass to energy using the conversion factor (1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2), we can compute the total energy. After performing the calculations, the closest answer from the provided options is 20.132 GeV, which is consistent across multiple analyses.\n\nAnswer:B",
