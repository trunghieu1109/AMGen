Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) at a speed of 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula E = γmc². The Lorentz factor γ is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²)). For v = 0.96c, we find γ. The mass of Li-6 (which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons) is approximately 6.015 amu. Converting this mass to energy using the conversion factor (1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c²), we can compute the total energy. After performing the calculations, the closest answer from the provided options is 20.132 GeV, which is consistent across multiple analyses.
