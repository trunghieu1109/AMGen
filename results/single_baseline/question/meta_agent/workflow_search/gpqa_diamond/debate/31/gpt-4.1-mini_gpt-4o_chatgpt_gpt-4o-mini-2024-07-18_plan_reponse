        "response": "To determine the energy of the lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2) for v = 0.96c is approximately 3.57. The rest mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units, which is about 5.6 GeV/c\u00b2 (since 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2). Therefore, the relativistic energy E = \u03b3 * rest mass energy = 3.57 * 5.6 GeV = 19.992 GeV. The closest choice to this calculated energy is 20.132 GeV.\n\nAnswer:B)",
