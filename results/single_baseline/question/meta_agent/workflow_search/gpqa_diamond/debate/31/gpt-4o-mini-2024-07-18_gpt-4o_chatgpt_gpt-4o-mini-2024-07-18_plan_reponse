        "response": "All agents calculated the relativistic energy using the Lorentz factor and the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons. The rest mass energy was approximated as 6 times the nucleon mass, which is about 5.628 GeV. The Lorentz factor for a speed of 0.96c is approximately 3.57. Multiplying the rest mass energy by the Lorentz factor gives an energy of approximately 20.091 GeV. The closest choice to this calculated energy is 20.132 GeV, which is choice B). Therefore, the consensus among the agents, except for DIHY, is that the correct answer is B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
