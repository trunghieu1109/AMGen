### thinking by Debate Agent sZ3G:
Ground-based optical spectrographs are limited by atmospheric cutoff around ~3500 Å. To observe Lyman α (rest λ₀=1216 Å) in absorption, we need λobs ≥ 3500 Å. The redshift is z = (λobs/λ₀) − 1 ≈ (3500/1216) − 1 ≈ 1.88. Thus the lowest redshift detectable is ≃1.9.

### thinking by Debate Agent RVMO:
Optical ground‐based telescopes are limited at the blue/UV end by the atmosphere and detector sensitivity, typically cutting off around about 3500 Å. We need the redshift z such that Lyman-α at rest λ0=1216 Å shifts to ≥3500 Å so that it lies in the observable window:

λ_obs = λ0(1+z) ≥ 3500 Å  → 1+z ≥ 3500/1216 ≈ 2.88 → z ≥ 1.88.

Hence the lower limit on z is about 1.9, corresponding to choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent z3kk:
To detect Lyα absorption at rest λ0 = 1216 Å with ground-based optical telescopes, the redshifted wavelength λobs = λ0(1 + z) must lie above the atmospheric cutoff (~3000–3500 Å). Taking λobs ≈ 3500 Å gives 1 + z ≈ 3500/1216 ≈ 2.88 → z ≈ 1.88. Thus the minimum redshift is ≳1.9, corresponding to choice A.

### thinking by Debate Agent SnG3:
The Lyman-α line at rest is at λ0=1216 Å. To be observed from the ground it must be redshifted into the atmospheric/optical window, roughly λobs≳3600 Å. The redshift is z=(λobs/λ0)−1. For λobs≈3600 Å, z≈3600/1216−1≈1.96. Thus the minimum redshift is about z≈2. This matches choice A) 1.9.

To observe Lyman α (rest 1216 Å) in absorption, we need λ_obs = 1216 Å × (1 + z) ≥ 3500 Å, so z ≥ 3500/1216 − 1 ≈ 1.88. Thus the minimum redshift is about 1.9.
