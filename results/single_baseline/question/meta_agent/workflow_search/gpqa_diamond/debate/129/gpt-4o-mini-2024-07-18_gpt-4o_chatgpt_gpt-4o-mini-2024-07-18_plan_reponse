        "response": "To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the optical wavelength range, which is approximately 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. The redshift formula is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. For the lower limit, we use the shortest optical wavelength, 4000 Angstroms. Solving for z: z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 2.29. The closest choice greater than 2.29 is 2.4. All agents agree on this calculation and choice.\n\nAnswer:B)",
