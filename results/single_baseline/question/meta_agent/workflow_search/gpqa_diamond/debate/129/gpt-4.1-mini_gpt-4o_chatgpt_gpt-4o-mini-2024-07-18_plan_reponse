        "response": "All agents agree that to detect the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Angstroms with optical ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must be within the optical range, typically from 3800 Angstroms to 7500 Angstroms. Using the redshift formula, the minimum redshift is calculated to be approximately 2.12. The closest provided option that is greater than or equal to this value is 2.4. Therefore, the consensus is that the lower limit on the redshift for detection is 2.4.\n\nAnswer:B)",
