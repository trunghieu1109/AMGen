Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Ground-based optical telescopes are limited at the blue end by the atmosphere and detector sensitivity, cutting off around 3500 Å. To observe Lyman α (rest 1216 Å) in absorption, we need λ_obs = 1216 Å × (1 + z) ≥ 3500 Å, so z ≥ 3500/1216 − 1 ≈ 1.88. Thus the minimum redshift is about 1.9.
