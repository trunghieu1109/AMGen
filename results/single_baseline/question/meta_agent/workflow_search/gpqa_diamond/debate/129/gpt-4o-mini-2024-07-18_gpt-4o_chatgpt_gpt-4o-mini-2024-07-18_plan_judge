Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the optical wavelength range, which is approximately 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. The redshift formula is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. For the lower limit, we use the shortest optical wavelength, 4000 Angstroms. Solving for z: z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 â‰ˆ 2.29. The closest choice greater than 2.29 is 2.4. All agents agree on this calculation and choice.
