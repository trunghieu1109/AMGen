### thinking by Debate Agent Oz3k:
To determine the lower limit on the redshift (z) of neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb light at the Lyman alpha wavelength (~1216 Angstrom), we need to consider how redshift affects the observed wavelength of light. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the formula: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z). For the Lyman alpha transition, λ_emitted = 1216 Angstrom. To detect these clouds with optical ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must be within the optical range. The optical range typically extends up to about 7000 Angstrom. We can set up the equation: 7000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z gives us the necessary redshift. Rearranging the equation gives us z = (7000/1216) - 1. Calculating this gives a value of approximately 4.76, which means that the lower limit on the redshift must be less than this value to be detectable. Among the provided options, the closest lower limit is 2.4, as the other options either exceed this value or are too low to be detectable with optical telescopes.

### thinking by Debate Agent kSnG:
To determine the lower limit on the redshift (z) for neutral hydrogen clouds to absorb Lyman alpha light at ~1216 Angstroms, we need to consider the relationship between redshift and wavelength. The Lyman alpha line will be redshifted by a factor of (1 + z). For optical ground-based telescopes, we typically can detect wavelengths up to about 9000 Angstroms. Therefore, we set up the following equation: 1216 Angstrom * (1 + z) = 9000 Angstrom. Solving for z gives us z = (9000/1216) - 1. Calculating this gives z ≈ 6.41 - 1 = 5.41. However, the question asks for the lower limit, and we need to check the provided options against this. The closest and most reasonable value from the choices given is 2.4, as it falls within a detectable range for optical telescopes considering the redshift of the universe and the limitations of ground-based observations.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3wT1:
To detect the Lyman alpha emission line from quasars that is originally at ~1216 Angstroms, we need to consider how redshift affects the observed wavelength. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) can be calculated using the formula: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z), where λ_emitted is the emitted wavelength (1216 Angstroms) and z is the redshift. For optical ground-based telescopes, the detection limit typically falls within the optical range of about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Therefore, we need to find the minimum z such that λ_observed is within this range. Setting λ_observed to 4000 Angstroms gives us the equation: 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z gives us z = (4000/1216) - 1, which approximates to 2.29. This suggests that the lower limit on the redshift for detection is around 2.29. Among the provided options, the closest value is 2.4.

### thinking by Debate Agent OfGX:
To detect the Lyman-alpha emission from neutral hydrogen clouds, we need to consider the redshift at which the Lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 Angstrom) shifts into the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. The optical range typically starts around 4000 Angstroms. We can use the formula for redshift z, which is given by z = (λ_observed - λ_emitted) / λ_emitted. Rearranging this, we can find the minimum redshift needed for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical range. Setting λ_observed = 4000 Angstrom and λ_emitted = 1216 Angstrom, we can calculate z. The calculations yield a lower limit for redshift around 2.4, which corresponds to the option provided.

The closest option that falls within a reasonable range for detection is 2.4, as it is the only option that is not too low or too high compared to the calculated values. Therefore, the answer is 2.4.
