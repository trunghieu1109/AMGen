### thinking by Debate Agent sZ3G:
To determine the redshift (z) at which the Lyman alpha wavelength (~1216 Angstroms) is shifted into the optical range, we need to find the wavelength range of optical telescopes. The optical range is approximately 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. To find the lower limit of redshift, we consider the lower bound of the optical range, which is 4000 Angstroms. Solving for z: z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 ≈ 2.29. Therefore, the closest choice greater than 2.29 is 2.4.

### thinking by Debate Agent RVMO:
To determine the lower limit on the redshift (z) such that the Lyman alpha wavelength of 1216 Angstrom can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the optical range, which is approximately 4000 Angstrom to 7000 Angstrom. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the formula: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z). Setting λ_emitted = 1216 Angstrom and λ_observed to the minimum optical wavelength (4000 Angstrom), we solve for z: 4000 Angstrom = 1216 Angstrom * (1 + z). Solving for z gives z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.29. Therefore, the closest choice greater than this value is 2.4.

### thinking by Debate Agent z3kk:
To detect the Lyman alpha line at ~1216 Angstrom with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to determine the redshift (z) at which this wavelength is shifted into the optical range (approximately 4000 to 7000 Angstrom). The redshift formula is: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). For the lower limit, we consider the shortest optical wavelength, 4000 Angstrom. Solving 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z) gives z = (4000/1216) - 1, which is approximately 2.29. Therefore, the closest option is 2.4.

### thinking by Debate Agent SnG3:
To detect the Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the range of wavelengths that optical telescopes can observe. Typically, optical telescopes can observe wavelengths from about 3800 Angstroms to 7500 Angstroms. The redshift, z, is given by the formula: \( \lambda_{observed} = \lambda_{emitted} \times (1 + z) \). To find the lower limit of the redshift, we set \( \lambda_{observed} = 3800 \) Angstroms and \( \lambda_{emitted} = 1216 \) Angstroms. Solving for z, we get \( z = \frac{\lambda_{observed}}{\lambda_{emitted}} - 1 = \frac{3800}{1216} - 1 \approx 2.12 \). Therefore, the closest choice that meets this condition is 2.4.
