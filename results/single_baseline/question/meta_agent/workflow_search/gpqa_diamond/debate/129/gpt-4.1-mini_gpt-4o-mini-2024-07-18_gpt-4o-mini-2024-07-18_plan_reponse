        "response": "To determine the lower limit on the redshift (z) for neutral hydrogen clouds to absorb Lyman alpha light at ~1216 Angstroms, we need to consider the relationship between redshift and wavelength. The observed wavelength (\u03bb_observed) is related to the emitted wavelength (\u03bb_emitted) by the formula: \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * (1 + z). For optical ground-based telescopes, we typically can detect wavelengths up to about 7000 Angstroms. Setting \u03bb_observed to 7000 Angstroms gives us the equation: 7000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z gives us z = (7000/1216) - 1, which calculates to approximately 4.76. However, we are looking for the lower limit on the redshift that allows detection. The closest option that falls within a reasonable range for detection is 2.4, as it is the only option that is not too low or too high compared to the calculated values. Therefore, the answer is 2.4.\n\nAnswer:2.4",
