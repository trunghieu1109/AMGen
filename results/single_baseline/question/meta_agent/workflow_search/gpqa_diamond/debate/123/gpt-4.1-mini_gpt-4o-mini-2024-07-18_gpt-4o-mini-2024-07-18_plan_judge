Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the decay length of the particles. Currently, with a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third of the particles reach the walls. To increase this to two thirds, we need a Lorentz factor that allows for a longer decay length. The options provided suggest that a higher Lorentz factor will enable more particles to reach the walls. After evaluating the choices, a Lorentz factor of 40 seems to be the most reasonable increase from 20, as it would significantly enhance the distance traveled by the particles before decaying, thus allowing more of them to reach the walls. Therefore, the best choice is 40.
