            "Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?",

        "response": "The problem involves determining the Lorentz factor needed for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, given that one third reach with a Lorentz factor of 20. The Lorentz factor affects time dilation, which in turn affects the distance particles can travel before decaying. To increase the fraction of particles reaching the walls from one third to two thirds, we need to increase the Lorentz factor to allow for greater time dilation. The relationship between the Lorentz factor and the fraction of particles reaching the walls is not linear, but doubling the effective distance suggests a significant increase in the Lorentz factor. The choice of 40 is approximately double the current Lorentz factor of 20, making it a reasonable estimate to achieve the desired increase in the fraction of particles reaching the walls.\n\nAnswer:B)",
