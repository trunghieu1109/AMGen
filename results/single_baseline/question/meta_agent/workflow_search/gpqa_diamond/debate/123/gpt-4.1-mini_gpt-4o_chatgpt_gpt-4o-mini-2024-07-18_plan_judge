Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the Lorentz factor affects the distance particles can travel before decaying. Currently, with a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. To have two thirds reach the walls, the Lorentz factor must be increased to allow particles to travel further. The relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance traveled is linear, so doubling the fraction of particles reaching the walls suggests doubling the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the new Lorentz factor should be approximately 40.
