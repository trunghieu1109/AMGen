Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Particles decay exponentially with survival probability P=exp(−L/(γcτ0)). For γ1=20 we have P1=1/3 when L=30 m ⇒ 1/3=exp(−L/(20cτ0)) ⇒ L/(cτ0)=20 ln3. To get P2=2/3 we require exp(−L/(γ2cτ0))=2/3 ⇒ L/(γ2cτ0)=ln(3/2). Hence γ2=(L/(cτ0))/ln(3/2)=(20 ln3)/ln(3/2)≈54.2, so the closest choice is 54.
