            "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?",
            "ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship",
            "the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame",
            "the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing",
            "the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The question involves a genetic construct designed to express a ligand and receptor pair, with the receptor fused to eGFP. The construct uses a Cre-lox system to control expression, with stop cassettes that are excised in the presence of Cre recombinase. The SOX10-Cre mice should express Cre recombinase in neural crest cells, allowing expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein. The lack of a green signal suggests an issue with the receptor-eGFP expression. The most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent the expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein, leading to no green signal. Other options like paracrine relationship or Golgi retention do not directly explain the lack of green fluorescence in this setup. A missing enhancer would affect overall expression but not specifically prevent the green signal if mCherry is observed. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is a frame issue with the receptor-eGFP construct.\n\nAnswer:B)",
