            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",
            "green signal colocalizes with the red signal",
            "there is no green signal",
            "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
            "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal",

        "response": "The experiment involves tracking iPSCs labeled with mRaspberry (red signal) and observing apoptotic events using TUNEL-FITC staining (green signal). The main observation would be whether the iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis, which would be indicated by colocalization of the green and red signals. All agents agree that the first observation would likely involve the colocalization of these signals, indicating that the iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis.\n\nAnswer:A)",
