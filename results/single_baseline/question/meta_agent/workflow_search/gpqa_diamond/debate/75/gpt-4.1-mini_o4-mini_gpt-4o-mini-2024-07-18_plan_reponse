            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",

            "there is no green signal",
            "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
            "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal",

        "response": "Injected iPSCs express mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter without any localization tag, and at the earliest time point (12 h) apoptosis (TUNEL\u2010FITC) is minimal or absent. Thus the first observable signal is the diffuse cytoplasmic red fluorescence of the labeled iPSCs.\n\nAnswer:D)",
