            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",
            "green signal colocalizes with the red signal",
            "there is no green signal",
            "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
            "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal",

        "response": "The experiment involves tracking iPSCs labeled with a red fluorescent protein (mRaspberry) in a developing mouse embryo, with apoptotic events detected using TUNEL-FITC staining, which emits a green signal. The question asks for the first observation made under a confocal microscope. If the iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis, the red and green signals would co-localize, indicating that the iPSCs are contributing to tissues where apoptosis is occurring. All agents agree that the most logical observation would be the co-localization of the red and green signals, suggesting that the iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, the first thing noticed would be the co-localization of the red and green signals.\n\nAnswer:A)",
