Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction sequence involves identifying compounds through a series of transformations starting from propene. Compound A is propene, which undergoes bromination to form 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Dehydrohalogenation of B with alcoholic KOH regenerates propene (Compound C). Passing propene through a red-hot iron tube forms benzene (Compound D). Benzene undergoes nitration to form nitrobenzene (Compound E), which is reduced to aniline (Compound F). Aniline reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt (Compound G), which is converted to phenol (Compound H) with sodium hydroxide. Evaluating the statements: D (benzene) gives one singlet in 1H NMR, not two. F (aniline) is used in dye synthesis. H (phenol) gives a violet color with ferric chloride, not yellow. C (propene) is a flammable gas. The incorrect statement is about the color reaction with ferric chloride.
