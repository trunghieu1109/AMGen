            "Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.",

        "response": "The reaction sequence involves the transformation of propene (C3H6) through several steps, ultimately forming phenol. The key transformations are: propene to 1,2-dibromopropane, then back to propene, then to benzene, then to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally to phenol. Evaluating the statements: D (benzene) should give a single singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum, not two singlets, making this statement incorrect. F (aniline) is indeed used in dye synthesis, which is correct. H (phenol) gives a violet color with ferric chloride, not yellow, making this statement incorrect. C (propene) is a flammable gas, which is correct. The incorrect statement about the products is that D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.\n\nAnswer:A)",
