            "Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.",
            "D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.",
            "F is used for the synthesis of dyes.",
            "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.",
            "C is a flammable gas.",

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "Compound A is propene (C3H6). Bromination gives B (1,2-dibromopropane). Alcoholic KOH eliminates twice to give C (propyne), a flammable gas. Passing C through a red-hot iron tube cyclotrimerizes it to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene, D), which shows two singlets in its 1H NMR (one for the three methyls, one for the three aromatic H\u2019s). Nitration of D gives E (nitromesitylene), reduction with Fe/HCl gives F (mesitylaniline), which is used in dye synthesis. Diazotization of F yields G (diazonium salt), and treatment with NaOH gives H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol), which gives a violet/blue, not yellow, colour with FeCl3. Thus statement 3 is incorrect.\n\nAnswer:C)",
