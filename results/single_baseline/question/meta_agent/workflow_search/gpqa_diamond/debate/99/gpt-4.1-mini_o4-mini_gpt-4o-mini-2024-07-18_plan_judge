Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Compound A is propene (C3H6). Bromination gives B (1,2-dibromopropane). Alcoholic KOH eliminates twice to give C (propyne), a flammable gas. Passing C through a red-hot iron tube cyclotrimerizes it to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene, D), which shows two singlets in its 1H NMR (one for the three methyls, one for the three aromatic H’s). Nitration of D gives E (nitromesitylene), reduction with Fe/HCl gives F (mesitylaniline), which is used in dye synthesis. Diazotization of F yields G (diazonium salt), and treatment with NaOH gives H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol), which gives a violet/blue, not yellow, colour with FeCl3. Thus statement 3 is incorrect.
