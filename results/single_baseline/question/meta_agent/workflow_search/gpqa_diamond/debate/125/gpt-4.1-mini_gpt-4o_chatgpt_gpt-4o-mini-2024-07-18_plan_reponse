            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "Reaction I produces a single enantiomer, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which will appear as one peak in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound and achiral, appearing as one peak in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. Therefore, in normal-phase HPLC, we expect 2 peaks: one for each compound. In chiral HPLC, the single enantiomer from Reaction I and the achiral compound from Reaction II will also result in 2 peaks. Thus, the correct answer is 2 peaks in both chiral and normal-phase HPLC.\n\nAnswer:3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC",
