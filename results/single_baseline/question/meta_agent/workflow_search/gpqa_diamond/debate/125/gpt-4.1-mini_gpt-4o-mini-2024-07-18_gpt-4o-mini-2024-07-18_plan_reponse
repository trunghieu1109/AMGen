            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "response": "In Reaction I, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to form one alcohol product, which is chiral. In Reaction II, pentane-2,4-dione is reduced to form two alcohol products, which can exist as two enantiomers. Therefore, after both reactions, we have a total of three products: one from Reaction I and two from Reaction II. In normal-phase HPLC, these products will be separated based on their polarity, leading to a total of 3 distinct peaks. In chiral HPLC, the enantiomers will be separated, leading to a total of 4 peaks (1 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II: 2 enantiomers). Thus, the chemist will observe 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 3 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. The best matching option is 3 peaks in normal-phase HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC, but since that option is not available, the closest correct answer is 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC, which corresponds to choice A.\n\nAnswer:A",
