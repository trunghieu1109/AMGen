            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "response": "In Reaction I, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single chiral alcohol. In Reaction II, pentane-2,4-dione is reduced to 2,4-pentanediol, which has two chiral centers, resulting in four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers). In normal-phase HPLC, the products are separated based on polarity, so the chiral alcohol from Reaction I and the mixture from Reaction II will likely give 2 peaks. In chiral HPLC, the chiral alcohol from Reaction I will give 1 peak, while the four stereoisomers from Reaction II will give 4 peaks, resulting in a total of 5 peaks. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\nAnswer:B",
