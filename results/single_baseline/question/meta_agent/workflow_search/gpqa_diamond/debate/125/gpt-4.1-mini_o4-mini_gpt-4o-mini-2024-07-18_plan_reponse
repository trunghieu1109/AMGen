            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "response": "Reaction I: LAH reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one creates a new stereocenter at C3 on an enantiopure substrate (C5), giving two diastereomers (no enantiomeric pairs) \u2192 2 peaks on both achiral and chiral. Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione reduction yields pentane-2,4-diol with two stereocenters: one meso and one enantiomeric pair (3 stereoisomers). On achiral HPLC enantiomers coelute, so meso + racemate = 2 peaks; on chiral HPLC they separate into 3 peaks. Combined: normal-phase = 2+2 = 4 peaks; chiral = 2+3 = 5 peaks.\n\nAnswer:B)",
