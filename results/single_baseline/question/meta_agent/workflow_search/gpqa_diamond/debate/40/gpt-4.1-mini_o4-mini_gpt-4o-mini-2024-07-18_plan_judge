Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In the glass rest frame the light speed is u'=1/n. In the lab frame where the glass moves at speed v in the same direction as the beam, use relativistic velocity addition: u=(u'+v)/(1+u'v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+nv)/(n+v), which corresponds to choice C).
