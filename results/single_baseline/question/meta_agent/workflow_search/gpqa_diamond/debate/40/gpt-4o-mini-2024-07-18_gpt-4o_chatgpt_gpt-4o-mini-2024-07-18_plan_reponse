            "A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.",

        "response": "All agents agree that the problem involves the relativistic addition of velocities. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is c/n, and the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light relative to the observer is (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n). Simplifying this expression gives (1 + nv) / (n + v), which matches choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
