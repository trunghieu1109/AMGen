The glass moves at speed v toward the observer in the lab frame, in the same direction as the beam. Using the special‐relativistic velocity addition formula u=(u'+v)/(1+u' v) with c=1 gives u=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v). This matches choice 3, labeled “C.”\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent yeSQ:\nWe need the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass rest frame the light speed is u' = c/n = 1/n. The glass moves at v in the lab frame. The velocity of light in lab is u = (v + u')/(1 + v·u') = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) = (n v + 1)/(n + v). This matches choice3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent WHIk:\nIn the glass rest frame the light speed is u'=1/n. To get the speed in the lab where the glass moves at velocity v in the same direction, apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: u=(u'+v)/(1+u'v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent moGY:\nThe light’s speed in the glass rest frame is u′=c/n=1/n. The lab frame sees the glass moving at v in the same direction, so by relativistic velocity addition: u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+nv)/(n+v). This matches choice3.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent iMkA:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yeSQ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent WHIk:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent moGY:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
