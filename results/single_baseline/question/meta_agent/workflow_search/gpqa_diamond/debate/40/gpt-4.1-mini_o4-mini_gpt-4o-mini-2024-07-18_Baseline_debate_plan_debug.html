    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent iMkA:
In the glass rest frame the light speed is u&#39;=1/n. The glass moves at speed v toward the observer in the lab frame, in the same direction as the beam. Using the special‐relativistic velocity addition formula u=(u&#39;+v)/(1+u&#39; v) with c=1 gives u=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v). This matches choice 3, labeled “C.”

### thinking by Debate Agent yeSQ:
We need the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass rest frame the light speed is u&#39; = c/n = 1/n. The glass moves at v in the lab frame. The velocity of light in lab is u = (v + u&#39;)/(1 + v·u&#39;) = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) = (n v + 1)/(n + v). This matches choice3.

### thinking by Debate Agent WHIk:
In the glass rest frame the light speed is u&#39;=1/n. To get the speed in the lab where the glass moves at velocity v in the same direction, apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: u=(u&#39;+v)/(1+u&#39;v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+n v)/(n+v).

### thinking by Debate Agent moGY:
The light’s speed in the glass rest frame is u′=c/n=1/n. The lab frame sees the glass moving at v in the same direction, so by relativistic velocity addition: u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+nv)/(n+v). This matches choice3.
