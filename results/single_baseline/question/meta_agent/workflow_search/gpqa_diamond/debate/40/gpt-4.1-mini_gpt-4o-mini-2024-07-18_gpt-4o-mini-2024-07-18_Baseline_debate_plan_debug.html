### thinking by Debate Agent yeSQ:
To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we can use the formula for the relativistic addition of velocities. The speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and we have the index of refraction n for the glass. The glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v. The formula for light speed relative to the observer when the medium is moving is given by (1 + n*v)/(n + v). Therefore, the correct choice corresponds to this formula.

### thinking by Debate Agent WHIk:
To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in the medium (glass) is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we need to consider this motion in our calculations. The formula for the speed of light in a medium moving towards the observer can be expressed as (c/n + v) / (1 + (v/c)(1/n)). Given that c = 1, we can simplify this further. After substituting and simplifying, we can find the correct expression that matches one of the choices provided.

### thinking by Debate Agent moGY:
To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and the index of refraction n gives us the speed of light in glass as c/n. When the glass is moving with velocity v, we need to calculate the effective speed of light as seen by the observer. The formula for relativistic addition of velocities gives us the necessary relationship to find the effective speed. We can derive this step by step, but the final form we are looking for matches one of the provided choices.

### thinking by Debate Agent w2TS:
To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we can use the formula for relativistic addition of velocities. Given that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and the glass has an index of refraction n, the effective speed of light in the moving medium can be calculated using the appropriate formula. The correct form that accounts for the motion of the glass toward the observer is (1+n*v)/(n-v).

    <pre>To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and the index of refraction n indicates that the speed of light in glass is c/n. When the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, we need to account for this motion. The correct formula for the speed of light in the moving medium as seen by the observer is (1 + n*v)/(n - v). This matches with the first choice provided.
