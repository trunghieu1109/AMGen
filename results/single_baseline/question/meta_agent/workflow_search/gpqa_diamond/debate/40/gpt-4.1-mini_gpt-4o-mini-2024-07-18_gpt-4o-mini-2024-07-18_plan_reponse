            "A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.",

        "response": "To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in vacuum is c=1, and the index of refraction n indicates that the speed of light in glass is c/n. When the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, we need to account for this motion. The correct formula for the speed of light in the moving medium as seen by the observer is (1 + n*v)/(n - v). This matches with the first choice provided.\n\nAnswer:A",
