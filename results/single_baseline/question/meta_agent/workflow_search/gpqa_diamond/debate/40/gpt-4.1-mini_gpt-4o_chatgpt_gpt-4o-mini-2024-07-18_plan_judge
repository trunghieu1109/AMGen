Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is c/n, and the glass is moving with velocity v. Using the formula (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2) and substituting c = 1, we get (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n). Simplifying this expression results in (1 + nv) / (n + v), which corresponds to choice C).
