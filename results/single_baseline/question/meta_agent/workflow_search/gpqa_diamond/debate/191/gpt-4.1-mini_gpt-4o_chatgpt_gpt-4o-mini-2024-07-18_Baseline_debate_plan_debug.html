    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent bQCF:
The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity of a spherical conductor. Due to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the conductor (between the cavity and the outer surface) is zero. The charge induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the cavity equal in magnitude to +q, and a positive charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor. The field outside the conductor is due to this induced charge on the outer surface, which behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is due to this effective charge +q at the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent qxAB:
Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge is placed inside the cavity, the electric field outside the conductor is only due to the charge +q. By Gauss&#39;s law, the charge inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity, and the outer surface of the conductor remains uncharged. Therefore, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is the same as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, which is L.

### thinking by Debate Agent EZN1:
The problem involves a charged cavity inside an uncharged spherical conductor. By electrostatic shielding, the conductor will distribute charges to neutralize the effect of the charge inside the cavity on the outside. The conductor will have an induced negative charge on the inner surface of the cavity and an equal positive charge on its outer surface. The electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge q is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, at point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field will be determined by the charge q at the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent FGMS:
The problem involves a charged cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor due to electrostatic induction. The net effect is that the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. According to Gauss&#39;s Law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution depends only on the total charge enclosed and the distance from the center. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, will be equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor, and it will depend only on the distance L from the center of the conductor.
