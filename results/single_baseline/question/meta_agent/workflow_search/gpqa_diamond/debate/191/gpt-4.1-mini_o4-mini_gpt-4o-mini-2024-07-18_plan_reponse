            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",

        "response": "When +q is placed in the cavity, \u2013q is induced on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. Outside the conductor, the field depends only on the total charge +q on the outer surface and is spherically symmetric as if located at the centre. By Gauss\u2019s law, E = (1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)\u00b7q/L\u00b2.\n\nAnswer:D",
