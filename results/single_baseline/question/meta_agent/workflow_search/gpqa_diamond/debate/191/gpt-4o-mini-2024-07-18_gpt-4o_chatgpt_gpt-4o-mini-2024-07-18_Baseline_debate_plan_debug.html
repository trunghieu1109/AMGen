    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent QCFq:
The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge. Due to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside a conductor is zero, and any excess charge resides on the surface. However, the cavity is not part of the conductor, so the charge +q will induce a charge distribution on the inner surface of the cavity. The conductor itself will have an induced charge distribution on its outer surface, but since the conductor is uncharged, the total induced charge on the outer surface will be zero. Outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the charge +q as if it were at the center of the spherical conductor due to the shell theorem. Therefore, the electric field at point P depends only on the charge +q and the distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P.

### thinking by Debate Agent xABE:
The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity and a charge inside the cavity. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral initially, will have an equal positive charge distributed uniformly over its surface. For a point outside the conductor, the system behaves like a point charge located at the center of the conductor. The electric field at a point outside the conductor due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is determined by the total charge enclosed, and the field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined by the total charge +q and is calculated as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZN1F:
Since the spherical conductor is uncharged, any charge placed inside the cavity will induce a surface charge distribution on the inner surface of the cavity and an equal but opposite charge on the outer surface of the conductor. However, by Gauss&#39;s law, outside the conductor, the electric field due to the induced charges on the conductor will cancel out, and the electric field will only be due to the charge +q as if it were placed at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor is determined by the charge +q and the distance from the center of the cavity to point P, which is l. Thus, the electric field magnitude at point P is given by Coulomb&#39;s law for a point charge at a distance l from the charge.

### thinking by Debate Agent GMST:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of conductors and the effect of placing a charge inside a cavity within a conductor. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. This is due to the fact that the conductor must remain electrically neutral and the electric field inside a conductor is zero. For a point outside the conductor (at distance L from the center of the conductor), the conductor with the induced charges behaves as if the entire charge +q is located at its center. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is due to a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor. The electric field due to a point charge is given by Coulomb&#39;s law, which is E = (1 / (4 \pi \epsilon_o)) * (q / L^2).
