Outside the conductor only the net +q on the outer surface matters, acting as if concentrated at the conductor’s center. Thus E at distance L is (1/4πε0)·q/L2, which is choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent qxAB:\nWhen a charge +q is placed inside an off-center cavity in a conducting sphere, it induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. The external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and is spherically symmetric, as if +q were placed at the center of the conductor. Therefore, at a distance L>R from the center, E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L², corresponding to choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent EZN1:\nFor a conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q, induced charges sum to zero on the conductor but +q appears on the outer surface. Outside (r>R), the conductor acts like a point charge +q at its center, so E=1/(4πε₀)·q/L². Hence the correct choice is choice4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent FGMS:\nFor a conductor with an internal cavity containing charge +q, the induced charges on the inner wall are –q and on the outer surface +q. Outside the conductor the net charge is +q located effectively at the conductor’s center. By Gauss’s law, the field at distance L (>R) from the center is E = (1/4πε0)·q/L^2, independent of the cavity offset.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent bQCF:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent qxAB:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent EZN1:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FGMS:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
