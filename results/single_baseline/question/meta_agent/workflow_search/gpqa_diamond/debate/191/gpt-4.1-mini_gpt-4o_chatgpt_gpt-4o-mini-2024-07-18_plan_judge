Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. Due to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the conductor (between the cavity and the outer surface) is zero. The charge induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the cavity equal in magnitude to +q, and a positive charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor. The field outside the conductor is due to this induced charge on the outer surface, which behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is due to this effective charge +q at the center of the conductor. The electric field at a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution depends only on the total charge enclosed and the distance from the center. Thus, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, will be equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor, and it will depend only on the distance L from the center of the conductor.
