            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",

        "response": "The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral initially, will have an equal positive charge distributed uniformly over its surface. For a point outside the conductor, the system behaves like a point charge located at the center of the conductor. The electric field at a point outside the conductor due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is determined by the total charge enclosed, and the field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined by the total charge +q and is calculated as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. The correct choice is D) because the electric field at a point outside the conductor is due to the charge +q as if it were at the center of the spherical conductor, and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L.\n\nAnswer:D)",
