    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent bQCF:
The cavity charge induces –q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. Outside the conductor only the net +q on the outer surface matters, acting as if concentrated at the conductor’s center. Thus E at distance L is (1/4πε0)·q/L2, which is choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent qxAB:
When a charge +q is placed inside an off-center cavity in a conducting sphere, it induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. The external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and is spherically symmetric, as if +q were placed at the center of the conductor. Therefore, at a distance L&gt;R from the center, E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L², corresponding to choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent EZN1:
For a conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q, induced charges sum to zero on the conductor but +q appears on the outer surface. Outside (r&gt;R), the conductor acts like a point charge +q at its center, so E=1/(4πε₀)·q/L². Hence the correct choice is choice4.

### thinking by Debate Agent FGMS:
For a conductor with an internal cavity containing charge +q, the induced charges on the inner wall are –q and on the outer surface +q. Outside the conductor the net charge is +q located effectively at the conductor’s center. By Gauss’s law, the field at distance L (&gt;R) from the center is E = (1/4πε0)·q/L^2, independent of the cavity offset.
