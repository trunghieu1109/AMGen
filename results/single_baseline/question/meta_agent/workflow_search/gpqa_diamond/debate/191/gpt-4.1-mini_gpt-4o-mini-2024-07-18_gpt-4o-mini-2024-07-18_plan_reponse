            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n",

        "response": "In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface and a charge of +q on the outer surface. The electric field outside behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, at a distance L from the center of the conductor, the electric field can be calculated using the formula for a point charge, which is E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080))(q/L\u00b2). This leads us to conclude that the correct choice is option 4, which corresponds to this formula.\n\nAnswer:D",
