Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface and a charge of +q on the outer surface. The electric field outside behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, at a distance L from the center of the conductor, the electric field can be calculated using the formula for a point charge, which is E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²). This leads us to conclude that the correct choice is option 4, which corresponds to this formula.
