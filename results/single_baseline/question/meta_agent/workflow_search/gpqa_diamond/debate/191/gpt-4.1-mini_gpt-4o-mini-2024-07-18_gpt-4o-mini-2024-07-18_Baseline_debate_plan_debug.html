    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent ZN1F:
In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge. The key point to note is that the electric field outside a conductor is influenced only by the net charge on the conductor and any charge within the cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor, leaving the outer surface with a total charge of +q. This means that at a point outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. The distance L from the center of the conductor is greater than R, hence we can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge. The correct expression for the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is given by the formula for the electric field due to a point charge at a distance L, which is E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²). Therefore, the correct choice is choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent GMST:
When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor, and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor, at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge. Since L &gt; R, the electric field at point P is given by the equation E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q/L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P. The distance l from the center of the cavity does not affect the electric field at point P, as the conductor shields the cavity from influencing the external electric field.

### thinking by Debate Agent IyrT:
To determine the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor due to the charge +q placed in the cavity, we can apply Gauss&#39;s law. Since the spherical conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is inside the cavity, it will induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor and a charge of +q on the outer surface. The electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge. The distance L is greater than R, so we can ignore the geometry of the cavity for this calculation. The correct formula for the electric field at point P, at distance L from the center of the conductor, is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q/L²).

### thinking by Debate Agent d793:
In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a positive charge. According to Gauss&#39;s law, the electric field outside a conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor will respond by redistributing its charges such that the exterior electric field is due only to the charge +q. The distance to point P from the center of the spherical conductor is L, and since L &gt; R, we can treat the charge as if it were at the center of the conductor for the purpose of calculating the electric field at point P. The electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated. In this case, the relevant distance is L, hence the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q/L^2). Therefore, the correct choice is that the electric field magnitude at point P is given by option 4.
