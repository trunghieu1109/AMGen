Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves relativistic effects due to the high speed of the ejecta relative to the speed of light. We need to calculate the time dilation using the formula t = t' / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t' is the proper time (50 seconds), v is the velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (300,000 km/s). The time in the Galaxy's reference frame is t = 50 / sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)^2) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 51.02 seconds. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame is then distance = velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 3,061,200 km. The closest choice to this calculation is 3,060,000 km.
