Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame, we must account for time dilation due to the high relative velocity. The relative velocity is 60,000 km/s, which is significant compared to the speed of light (300,000 km/s). Using the time dilation formula, t = t_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t_0 is 50 seconds (ejecta's frame), we find t â‰ˆ 51.02 seconds in the Galaxy's frame. The distance is then calculated as velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s = 3,061,200 km. The closest choice is 3,060,000 km.
