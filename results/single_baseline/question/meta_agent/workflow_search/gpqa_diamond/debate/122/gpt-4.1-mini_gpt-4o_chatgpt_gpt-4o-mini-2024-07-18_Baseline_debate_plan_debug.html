    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 880 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 000 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 060 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 940 000 km.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FFAT:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to the relative velocity between the ejecta and the center of the Galaxy. The time experienced in the ejecta&#39;s reference frame is 50 seconds. The velocity of the center of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta is 60,000 km/s. In the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, the time elapsed will be longer due to time dilation.

The time dilation formula is: t = t_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the time in the Galaxy&#39;s frame, t_0 is the time in the ejecta&#39;s frame (50 seconds), v is the relative velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).

First, calculate the Lorentz factor: 

sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98.

Using the time dilation formula: t = 50 / 0.98 ≈ 51.02 seconds in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame.

Now, calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame using the relative velocity: 

Distance = velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s = 3,061,200 km.

The closest option to this calculated distance is 3,060,000 km.

### thinking by Debate Agent VS7z:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to the relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy. The time dilation formula from special relativity is given by Δt&#39; = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²), where Δt is the time interval in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, Δt&#39; is the time interval in the ejecta&#39;s reference frame, v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light. Given that Δt&#39; = 50 seconds and v = 60,000 km/s, we first calculate Δt. Once we have Δt, we can find the distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame by multiplying Δt by the velocity.

### thinking by Debate Agent fXSb:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic effects since the velocity is significant compared to the speed of light. We use the time dilation formula from special relativity: t = t&#39; / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the time in the Galaxy reference frame, t&#39; is the time in the ejecta reference frame (50 seconds), v is the velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (300,000 km/s). Calculate t, then find the distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame using d = vt.

### thinking by Debate Agent EY6v:
To solve this, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to the relative velocity between the Galaxy and the ejecta. The given velocity is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c (where c is the speed of light, approximately 300,000 km/s). Using the time dilation formula, t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t&#39; is the time in the ejecta frame (50 seconds) and t is the time in the Galaxy frame. Solving for t gives us t = 50 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 51.02 seconds. In the Galaxy frame, the ejecta travels at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s = 3,061,200 km. The closest option is 3,060,000 km.

    <pre>To determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, we must account for time dilation due to the high relative velocity. The relative velocity is 60,000 km/s, which is significant compared to the speed of light (300,000 km/s). Using the time dilation formula, t = t_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t_0 is 50 seconds (ejecta&#39;s frame), we find t ≈ 51.02 seconds in the Galaxy&#39;s frame. The distance is then calculated as velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s = 3,061,200 km. The closest choice is 3,060,000 km.
