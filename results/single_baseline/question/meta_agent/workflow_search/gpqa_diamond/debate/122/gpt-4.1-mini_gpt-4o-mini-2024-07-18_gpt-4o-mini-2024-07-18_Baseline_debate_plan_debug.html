    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 880 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 000 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 060 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 940 000 km.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent zfXS:
To find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, we need to consider the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s. In the reference frame of the ejecta, we are given a time duration of 50 seconds. Therefore, we can calculate the distance traveled using the formula: distance = speed × time. Here, the speed is 60,000 km/s and the time is 50 seconds. Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.

### thinking by Debate Agent bEY6:
To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame, we need to consider the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s. In the reference frame of the ejecta, it perceives the Galaxy moving towards it at this speed. Therefore, to the Galaxy, the ejecta is moving away from the center at the same speed. The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed × time. Since the time is given in the ejecta frame, we can directly apply the speed of 60,000 km/s for the 50 seconds elapsed. Thus, the distance traveled is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.

### thinking by Debate Agent vDBU:
To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame, we first need to determine the time dilation effect due to the relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy. However, since the problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, we can use the classical formula for distance traveled: distance = speed × time. The speed of the Galaxy&#39;s center relative to the ejecta is given as 60,000 km/s. We need to calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame during the 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta&#39;s frame. Since there is no time dilation to consider in this case, we can directly use the time in the ejecta&#39;s frame (50 seconds) to find the distance: distance = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.

### thinking by Debate Agent RDlK:
To find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta&#39;s reference frame, we can use the concept of time dilation from special relativity. However, since we are given the speed of the center of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta, we need to calculate how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy&#39;s frame. The speed of the center of the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s. In the ejecta&#39;s frame, 50 seconds pass, so we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s frame using the formula: distance = speed × time. Thus, distance = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.

Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. This calculation is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the distance is indeed 3,000,000 km.
