Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to consider the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s. In the reference frame of the ejecta, we are given a time duration of 50 seconds. Therefore, we can calculate the distance traveled using the formula: distance = speed Ã— time. Here, the speed is 60,000 km/s and the time is 50 seconds. Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. This calculation is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the distance is indeed 3,000,000 km.
