            "A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)",

        "response": "In the ejecta\u2019s rest frame the Galaxy center approaches at v=60 000 km/s = 0.2c. The proper time measured by the ejecta is \u0394\u03c4 = 50 s. The time dilation factor is \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1\u2212\u03b2\u00b2) with \u03b2 = 0.2, so \u03b3 = 1/\u221a0.96 \u2248 1.02062. The corresponding time interval in the Galaxy frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394\u03c4 \u2248 1.02062 \u00d7 50 s \u2248 51.03 s. In that frame the distance traveled by the ejecta is d = v \u0394t \u2248 60 000 km/s \u00d7 51.03 s \u2248 3.06\u00d710^6 km, which matches choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
