    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2 880 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 000 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3 060 000 km.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 940 000 km.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FFAT:
In the ejecta&#39;s reference frame, we have the time interval of 50 seconds and the speed of the Galaxy&#39;s center moving towards it as 60,000 km/s. According to the theory of relativity, we need to account for time dilation since the frames are moving relative to each other. The time dilation formula is t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the proper time (50 seconds), v is the velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). Calculating the time in the Galaxy&#39;s frame and then using the speed of the ejecta to find the distance traveled.

### thinking by Debate Agent VS7z:
We need to use the concept of time dilation from the theory of relativity because the speed of the ejecta is significant compared to the speed of light. The time dilation formula is t = t&#39; / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the time in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, t&#39; is the time in the ejecta&#39;s reference frame, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. First, calculate the time in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame: t = 50 / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)^2). Then, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame: distance = velocity * time.

### thinking by Debate Agent fXSb:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic effects since the speed involved (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light. We will use the time dilation formula from the theory of relativity. The time dilation formula is given by t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the time interval in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, t0 is the time interval in the ejecta&#39;s reference frame, v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). First, calculate the time interval in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame: t = 50 / sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)^2) = 50 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 50 / 0.98 ≈ 51.02 seconds. Now, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame using the formula: distance = velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 3,061,200 km.

### thinking by Debate Agent EY6v:
To solve this, we need to consider time dilation in special relativity because the speed involved is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c). The time dilation formula is: t&#39; = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t is the time in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame, t&#39; is the time in the ejecta&#39;s reference frame, v is the relative velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (300,000 km/s). First, calculate the time in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame using this formula. Then, use the velocity to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame.

    <pre>The problem involves relativistic effects due to the high speed of the ejecta relative to the speed of light. We need to calculate the time dilation using the formula t = t&#39; / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t&#39; is the proper time (50 seconds), v is the velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (300,000 km/s). The time in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame is t = 50 / sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)^2) = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 51.02 seconds. The distance traveled in the Galaxy&#39;s reference frame is then distance = velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 3,061,200 km. The closest choice to this calculation is 3,060,000 km.
