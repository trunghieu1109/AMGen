Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Magnons arise as Goldstone modes from broken spin-rotational symmetry, pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons are Goldstone modes from broken translational symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone excitations of a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
