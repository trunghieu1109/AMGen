### thinking by Debate Agent 6knX:
Spontaneously-broken symmetries in physics lead to the emergence of certain particles. Magnons are associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry in spin systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that can arise in certain field theories and are not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Phonons are quasiparticles associated with the collective excitations in a solid, typically arising from lattice vibrations, and are not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1pGw:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to understand the nature of each particle. Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice and are related to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet. Skyrmions are topological solitons that can arise in certain field theories and are related to spontaneously broken symmetries in those contexts. Pions are Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations in a solid and are not directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries but rather with the quantization of vibrational modes. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1KDQ:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to understand the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a crystal lattice, related to spontaneously-broken spin symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton solution in a field theory, often related to certain broken symmetries in magnetic systems. A pion is a meson associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, which is not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry but rather with lattice vibrations. Thus, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9NYY:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to evaluate each option. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with spin waves in a lattice and is related to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in magnets. A skyrmion is a topological soliton often found in magnetic systems and can be associated with certain symmetry breakings. A pion is associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, and while it is a quasiparticle, it is not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

    <pre>All agents agree that phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all related to spontaneously-broken symmetries in various contexts, such as spin systems and chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons, on the other hand, are related to lattice vibrations and are not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries. Therefore, the correct answer is phonon.
