        "response": "To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each option. Magnons are related to broken symmetry in magnetic systems, Skyrmions are topological solitons associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and Pions are Goldstone bosons linked to the breaking of chiral symmetry. Phonons, however, are quantized sound waves in a medium and do not arise from spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is Phonon.\n\nAnswer:D",
