Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone modes from broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons and not Goldstone modes arising from a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1pGw:\nWe examine each excitation: 1) Magnons are spin waves arising from spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnets (Goldstone modes). 2) Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. 3) Phonons are Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken translational symmetry in crystals. 4) Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone excitations of a broken symmetry. Therefore the particle not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking is the skyrmion.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1KDQ:\nWe consider each effective particle and the symmetry breaking associated:\n1. Magnon: arises as a Goldstone boson from spontaneous breaking of spin-rotation symmetry in a magnet.  \n2. Pion: emerges as an (approximate) Nambu–Goldstone boson due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.  \n3. Phonon: acoustic phonons are Goldstone modes from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetry in a crystal lattice.  \n4. Skyrmion: a topological soliton configuration, not itself a Goldstone excitation of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.  \nThus the particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 9NYY:\nWe need to identify which effective particle is not a Goldstone boson arising from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry:\n\n1. Magnon: the quantized spin wave in a magnet, arising from the spontaneous breaking of spin-rotational symmetry (SU(2) → U(1)).\n2. Pion: arises as the (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of the approximate chiral symmetry breaking in QCD (SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R → SU(2)_V).\n3. Phonon: the quantized lattice vibration in a crystal, arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry.\n4. Skyrmion: a topological soliton solution (not a Goldstone boson) describing a stable field configuration due to nontrivial homotopy, but not itself the result of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry's Goldstone mode.\n\nThus the particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6knX:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1pGw:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1KDQ:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9NYY:\nB\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
