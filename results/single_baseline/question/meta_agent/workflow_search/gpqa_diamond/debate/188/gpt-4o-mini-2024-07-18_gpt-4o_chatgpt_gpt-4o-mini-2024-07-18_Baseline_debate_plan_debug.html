### thinking by Debate Agent knX1:
Spontaneously-broken symmetries often lead to the emergence of effective particles known as Goldstone bosons. Magnons are associated with the broken symmetry in magnetic systems, Pions are Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, and Skyrmions are topological solitons which can be associated with certain broken symmetries. Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized lattice vibrations and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent pGw1:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to evaluate each option. A magnon is associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system and arises from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in spin space. A skyrmion is a topological soliton and is not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking but rather with topological configurations in field theories. A pion is associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is associated with lattice vibrations and arises from the breaking of translational symmetry in crystals. The skyrmion is more related to topological defects than spontaneous symmetry breaking.

### thinking by Debate Agent KDQ9:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to understand the origin of each particle. Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice and are related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons that can occur in certain field theories and are not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the traditional sense. Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Phonons are quasiparticles associated with lattice vibrations and are related to the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Thus, Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others.

### thinking by Debate Agent NYYq:
To determine which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to understand the context of each particle. Magnons are associated with the breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetic systems. Pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are related to the breaking of translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. They are more related to topological properties rather than symmetry breaking.

    <pre>The question asks which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons, pions, and phonons are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries: magnons with spin rotational symmetry, pions with chiral symmetry, and phonons with translational symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. They are more related to topological properties. Therefore, the correct answer is Skyrmion.
