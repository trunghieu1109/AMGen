Magnons are associated with the collective excitations in magnetic systems and relate to broken symmetry in ferromagnets. Skyrmions are topological solitons that also relate to broken symmetries in certain field theories. Pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized sound waves in a medium and do not arise from a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. Therefore, the correct answer is Phonon.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent NYYq:\nTo determine which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. Magnons are excitations in a ferromagnet and arise from a spontaneously broken symmetry of the magnetic order. Skyrmions are topological solitons that also arise in systems with spontaneously broken symmetries. Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a material and do not necessarily arise from a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, phonons do not fit the criteria of the question.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ymLW:\nTo determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option.

Magnons are associated with the breaking of symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in systems with chiral symmetry breaking. Pions are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a crystal lattice and do not arise from a spontaneously broken symmetry. Therefore, the answer is phonon.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KDQ9:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NYYq:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ymLW:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zuAS:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
