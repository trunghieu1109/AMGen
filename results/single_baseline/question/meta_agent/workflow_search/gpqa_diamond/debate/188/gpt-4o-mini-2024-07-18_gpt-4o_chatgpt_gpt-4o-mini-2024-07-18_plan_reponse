        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "The question asks which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons, pions, and phonons are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries: magnons with spin rotational symmetry, pions with chiral symmetry, and phonons with translational symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. They are more related to topological properties. Therefore, the correct answer is Skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B)",
