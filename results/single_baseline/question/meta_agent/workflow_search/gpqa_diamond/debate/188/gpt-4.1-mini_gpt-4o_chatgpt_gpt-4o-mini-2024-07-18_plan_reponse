        "response": "All agents agree that phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all related to spontaneously-broken symmetries in various contexts, such as spin systems and chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons, on the other hand, are related to lattice vibrations and are not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries. Therefore, the correct answer is phonon.\n\nAnswer:D)",
