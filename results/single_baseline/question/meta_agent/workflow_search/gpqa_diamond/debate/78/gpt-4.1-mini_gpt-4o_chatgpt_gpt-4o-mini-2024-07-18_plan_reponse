            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "The NMR data suggests the presence of aromatic protons, methyl groups, and a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR signals at \u03b4 2.28 and 2.31 are singlets, indicating methyl groups. The aromatic protons are indicated by the signals at \u03b4 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71. The 13C NMR shows signals for methyl carbons, aromatic carbons, and a carbonyl carbon at \u03b4 197.7. The presence of a carbonyl group suggests a ketone, which is not consistent with an epoxide. Among the choices, '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane' fits the NMR data best, as it accounts for the methyl groups and aromatic substitution pattern. The reaction conditions with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane could lead to rearrangement or elimination, forming a ketone. Therefore, the most consistent choice is '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane'.\n\nAnswer:B)",
