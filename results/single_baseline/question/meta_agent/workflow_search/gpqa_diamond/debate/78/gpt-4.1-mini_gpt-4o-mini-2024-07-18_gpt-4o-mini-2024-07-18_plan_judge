Question: Example(question='In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.', choice1='2-styrylepoxide', choice2='2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', choice3='2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', choice4='2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To identify Compound X (C11H12O), we analyze the provided NMR data. The 1H NMR shows signals indicating the presence of methyl groups (δ 2.28 and 2.31), which suggests the presence of substituents on an aromatic ring. The aromatic region (δ 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, 7.71) indicates multiple aromatic protons, consistent with a substituted phenyl group. The 13C NMR confirms the structure with signals corresponding to aliphatic and aromatic carbons. The presence of an oxirane (epoxide) is also suggested by the molecular formula and the chemical shifts. Comparing the choices, we need to find a structure that matches the molecular formula and the NMR data. After careful consideration, '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane' fits the description best, as it aligns with the molecular formula and the NMR patterns. Therefore, the final answer is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Answer:2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
Extracted answer: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
Correct answer: 2
