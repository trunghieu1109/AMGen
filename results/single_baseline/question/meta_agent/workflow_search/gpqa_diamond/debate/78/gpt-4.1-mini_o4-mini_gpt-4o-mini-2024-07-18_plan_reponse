            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "The product\u2019s 13C signal at \u03b4197.7 indicates a ketone formed via Meinwald rearrangement of an epoxide. Two 1H singlets at \u03b42.28 and 2.31\u2009ppm (each 3H) correspond to one aromatic methyl and one acyl methyl. Four aromatic protons appear as two doublets (\u03b47.08, 7.71\u2009ppm, J\u22488\u2009Hz), showing a para\u2010substituted benzene ring. Two olefinic protons at \u03b46.75 and 7.68\u2009ppm (J\u224816\u2009Hz) indicate an E\u2010configured \u03b1,\u03b2\u2010unsaturated ketone: (E)-1-(4-methylphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one. This product arises from the rearrangement of the p-methylstyrene oxide precursor, i.e., 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\nAnswer:B)",
