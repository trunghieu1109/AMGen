Question: Example(question='In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.', choice1='2-styrylepoxide', choice2='2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', choice3='2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', choice4='2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The product’s 13C signal at δ197.7 indicates a ketone formed via Meinwald rearrangement of an epoxide. Two 1H singlets at δ2.28 and 2.31 ppm (each 3H) correspond to one aromatic methyl and one acyl methyl. Four aromatic protons appear as two doublets (δ7.08, 7.71 ppm, J≈8 Hz), showing a para‐substituted benzene ring. Two olefinic protons at δ6.75 and 7.68 ppm (J≈16 Hz) indicate an E‐configured α,β‐unsaturated ketone: (E)-1-(4-methylphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one. This product arises from the rearrangement of the p-methylstyrene oxide precursor, i.e., 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.
