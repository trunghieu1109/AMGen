Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the enthalpy of neutralization, we calculated the moles of HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+, and Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.2 moles of OH-. The limiting reactant is OH- since we have 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.28 moles of H+. The heat of neutralization for strong acids and bases is typically around -57.1 kJ/mol. For 0.2 moles of OH- reacting, the heat released is -11.42 kJ, which converts to approximately -2.73 kcal. The closest answer from the choices provided is -2.72 kcal.

Answer:-2.72 kcal
Extracted answer: -2.72 kcal
Correct answer: 1
