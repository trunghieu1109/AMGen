Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the enthalpy of neutralization, we need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions and identify the limiting reactant. HCl provides 0.1 mol of H+ ions, and H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol of H+ ions, totaling 0.28 mol of H+. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol of OH- ions. The limiting reactant is OH- with 0.2 mol. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically -57.1 kJ/mol for strong acid-base reactions. Therefore, the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * -57.1 kJ/mol = -11.42 kJ. Converting to kcal, -11.42 kJ / 4.184 = -2.73 kcal. The closest choice is -2.72 kcal.
