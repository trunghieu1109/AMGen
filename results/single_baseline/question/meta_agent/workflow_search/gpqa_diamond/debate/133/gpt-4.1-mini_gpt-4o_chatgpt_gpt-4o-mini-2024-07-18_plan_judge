Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the calculation of moles of H+ and OH- ions. The moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are 0.28 moles, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.2 moles, making OH- the limiting reactant. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid-strong base reactions is typically -57.1 kJ/mol, which converts to approximately -13.7 kcal/mol. Therefore, the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * -13.7 kcal/mol = -2.74 kcal, which is closest to choice A) -2.72 kcal. Most agents agree on this choice.
