The expectation of 10σ_z + 5σ_x is 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩. Compute ⟨σ_z⟩ = |0.5|² - |√3/2|² = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Compute ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 Re(a*b) = 2 * 0.5 * (√3/2) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. Thus ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10*(-0.5) + 5*(0.8660) = -5 + 4.3301 = -0.6699 ≈ -0.7. This corresponds to choice D).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6iCN:\nWe have the state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ with a=0.5, b=√3/2.\nCompute ⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2−|b|^2 = 0.25 − 0.75 = −0.5.\nCompute ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2Re(a*b) = 2·0.5·(√3/2) = √3/2 ≃ 0.866.\nThus ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10(−0.5) + 5(0.866) = −5 + 4.33 = −0.67 ≃ −0.7.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent DmaR:\nThe state is ψ=½|↑〉+√3/2|↓〉. Compute ⟨σz⟩=|a|²−|b|²=¼−¾=−½. Compute ⟨σx⟩=2Re(ab*)=2·(½·√3/2)=√3/2≈0.866. Then ⟨10σz+5σx⟩=10(−½)+5(√3/2)=−5+ (5√3)/2≈−5+4.330=−0.67≈−0.7, which is choice D.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MasV:\nWe have |ψ⟩=a|↑⟩+b|↓⟩ with a=0.5 and b=√3/2. Compute ⟨σ_z⟩=|a|^2−|b|^2=0.25−0.75=−0.5. Compute ⟨σ_x⟩=2ab=2×0.5×(√3/2)=0.8660.
