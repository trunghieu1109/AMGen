Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem requires calculating the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for the given state |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩. The expectation value is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, where A is the operator. We calculate ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5 and ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = 0.5√3/2 + √3/2*0.5 = √3/2. The expectation value of 10σ_z + 5σ_x is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + 5√3/2. Approximating √3 ≈ 1.732, we get -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
