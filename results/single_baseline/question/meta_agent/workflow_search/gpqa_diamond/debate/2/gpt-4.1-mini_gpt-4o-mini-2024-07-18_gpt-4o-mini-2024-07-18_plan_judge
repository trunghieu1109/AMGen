Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx for the state |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √(3)/2|↓⟩, we calculate the individual expectation values of σz and σx. The expectation value of σz is -0.5, and for σx, it is √3/2. Substituting these into the expression gives us 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2). This evaluates to -5 + (5√3/2). Approximating √3 as 1.732 gives us 5*(1.732/2) = 4.33, leading to a total of -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. Therefore, the final answer is -0.7.

Answer:-0.7
