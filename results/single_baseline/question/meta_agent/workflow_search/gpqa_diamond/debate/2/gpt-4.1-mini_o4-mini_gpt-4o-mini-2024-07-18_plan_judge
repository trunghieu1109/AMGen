Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have |ψ⟩=0.5|↑⟩+√3/2|↓⟩. Compute ⟨σ_z⟩=|0.5|^2−|√3/2|^2=0.25−0.75=−0.5. Compute ⟨σ_x⟩=2·Re(0.5·√3/2)=√3/2≈0.866. Then ⟨10σ_z+5σ_x⟩=10(−0.5)+5(0.866)=−5+4.33=−0.67≈−0.7.
