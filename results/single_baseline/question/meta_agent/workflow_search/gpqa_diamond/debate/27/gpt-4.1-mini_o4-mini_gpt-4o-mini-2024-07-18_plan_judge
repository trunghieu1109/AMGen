Question: Example(question='S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice2='(2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice3="(1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol", choice4='(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Starting from (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, the 4-OH is protected as a TBS ether (retaining C4=S). Ph2CuLi performs a 1,4-addition of Ph– to C3 from the face opposite the bulky TBSO, giving C3=R, and the resulting enolate at C2 is alkylated with benzyl bromide to give C2=S. LDA/iodomethane then deprotonates and methylates the remaining α-position at C6, installing a Me equatorial (C6=S). Finally, HCl removes the TBS, regenerating the 4-OH (C4 remains S). The product is therefore 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-6-methyl-4-hydroxycyclohexan-1-one with stereochemistry 2S,3R,4S,6S.
