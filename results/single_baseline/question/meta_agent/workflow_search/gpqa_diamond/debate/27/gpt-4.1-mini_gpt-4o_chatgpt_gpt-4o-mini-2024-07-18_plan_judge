Question: Example(question='S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice2='(2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice3="(1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol", choice4='(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The sequence of reactions involves protecting the hydroxyl group, performing a conjugate addition with Ph2CuLi, alkylating with benzyl bromide, methylating with LDA and iodomethane, and finally deprotecting the silyl ether. The stereochemistry is preserved throughout these steps. All agents agree that the final product is (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one, which corresponds to choice D.
