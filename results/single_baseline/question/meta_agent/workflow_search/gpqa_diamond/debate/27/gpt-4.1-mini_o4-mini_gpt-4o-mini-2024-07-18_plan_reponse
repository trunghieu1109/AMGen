        "response": "Starting from (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, the 4-OH is protected as a TBS ether (retaining C4=S). Ph2CuLi performs a 1,4-addition of Ph\u2013 to C3 from the face opposite the bulky TBSO, giving C3=R, and the resulting enolate at C2 is alkylated with benzyl bromide to give C2=S. LDA/iodomethane then deprotonates and methylates the remaining \u03b1-position at C6, installing a Me equatorial (C6=S). Finally, HCl removes the TBS, regenerating the 4-OH (C4 remains S). The product is therefore 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-6-methyl-4-hydroxycyclohexan-1-one with stereochemistry 2S,3R,4S,6S.\n\nAnswer:A",
