Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: After analyzing the IR and NMR data for Compound X, it is clear that the presence of a broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 indicates a carboxylic acid functional group, supported by the peak at 1720 cm-1 which corresponds to a carbonyl group. The NMR data shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, along with aromatic protons and aliphatic protons. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI suggests that the compound is likely a carboxylic acid that can be converted into an alkyl halide. Among the provided choices, '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid' fits the data best, as it contains the necessary carboxylic acid functional group and matches the expected proton environments in the NMR spectrum. Therefore, the final product is '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid'.
