        "response": "The IR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid due to the broad peak at 3400\u20132500 cm-1 and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm-1. The NMR data supports this with a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, typical for a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic protons appear as doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals are consistent with a sec-butyl group. Compound X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid is reduced to an alkane, resulting in 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:A)",
