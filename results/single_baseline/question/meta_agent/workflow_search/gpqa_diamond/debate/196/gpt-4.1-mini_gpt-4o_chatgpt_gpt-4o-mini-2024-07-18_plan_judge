Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The IR data indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid due to the broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1. The 1H NMR data supports this with a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, typical for a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic protons appear as doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring. The remaining NMR signals suggest a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically reduces carboxylic acids to alkanes, removing the carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the final product would be a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group, which matches 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. All agents agree on this analysis.
