Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We compare densities: a) Earth’s density ~5.5 g/cm³; b) given ~5.5 g/cm³; c) for an Earth-composition planet of 5 M⊕, radius scales ~M^0.27 giving R≈1.54 R⊕, leading to density ≈7.6–8 g/cm³; d) for 0.5 M⊕, R≈0.83 R⊕, density ≈4.8–5.0 g/cm³. Thus option c has the highest density.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 2
