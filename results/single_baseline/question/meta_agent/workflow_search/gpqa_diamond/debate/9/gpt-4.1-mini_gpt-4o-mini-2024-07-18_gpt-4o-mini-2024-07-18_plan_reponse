        "response": "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we analyze the options based on their mass and size. Density is calculated as mass divided by volume. For option a, the density is approximately 5.5 g/cm^3 (same as Earth). For option b, the density is explicitly given as 5.5 g/cm^3. For option c, although it has 5 times the mass of Earth, its volume increases more significantly, leading to a lower density than 5.5 g/cm^3. For option d, with half the mass of Earth, the density would be higher than Earth's but still lower than 5.5 g/cm^3. Therefore, option b, with a density of 5.5 g/cm^3, is the highest density among the options provided.\n\nAnswer:b",
