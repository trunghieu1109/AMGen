        "response": "All agents agree that option C, a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive, is likely to have the highest density. This is because as mass increases, gravitational compression also increases, which typically results in a higher density. The other options either have the same density as Earth or are likely to have lower densities due to less gravitational compression. Therefore, option C is the most reasonable choice for the highest density.\n\nAnswer:C)",
