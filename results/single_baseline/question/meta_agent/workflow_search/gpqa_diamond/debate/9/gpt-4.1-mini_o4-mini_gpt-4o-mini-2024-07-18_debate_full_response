A 2\u2009M⊕ planet given as ρ≈5.5\u2009g/cm^3 ties that. For same composition as Earth but 5\u2009M⊕, internal pressures increase so R increases less than M^1/3, raising density above 5.5\u2009g/cm^3 (≈7.4\u2009g/cm^3). For 0.5\u2009M⊕ density would be slightly below 5.5\u2009g/cm^3. Thus the 5\u2009M⊕ Earth‐composition planet is densest.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ERnq:\nOption a: Earth-mass, Earth-radius → density ≃5.5 g/cm³.\nOption b: 2 Earth masses with given density ≃5.5 g/cm³ (same as Earth).\nOption c: Same composition as Earth but 5× mass. Rocky planet radius scales ~M^0.27: R ≃1.5 R⊕, so density ≃5/(1.5^3)×5.5≈8 g/cm³, higher than 5.5.\nOption d: 0.5× Earth mass → R≃0.83 R⊕, density ≃0.5/(0.83^3)×5.5≈4.8 g/cm³, lower.\nThus option c has the highest density.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ckaO:\nWe compare the densities: option a is Earth’s density (~5.51 g/cm3); option b is given as 5.5 g/cm3; option c, for an Earth‐composition planet of 5 M⊕, radius scales ∼M^0.27 ⇒ R≈1.54 R⊕, so density ≈5/(1.54^3)≈7.6 g/cm3; option d, for 0.5 M⊕, R≈0.83 R⊕ ⇒ density ≈0.5/(0.83^3)≈4.8 g/cm3. The highest is option c.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent iWQ8:\nFirst, estimate densities:\n\na) Earth-mass, Earth-radius ⇒ density ≈5.5 g/cm³.\nb) Given directly ≈5.5 g/cm³.\nc) Same composition as Earth but 5 M⊕. Higher central pressure raises density. Using rough mass–radius scaling R∝M^0.27 gives R≈1.53 R⊕, so density ≈5/(1.53³)×Earth’s ≈7.7 g/cm³.\nd) Same composition but 0.5 M⊕. R≈0.82 R⊕ ⇒ density ≈0.5/(0.82³)×5.5 ≈5.0 g/cm³.\n\nThus the 5 M⊕ Earth-composition planet has the highest density.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 755K:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ERnq:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ckaO:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent iWQ8:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
