        "response": "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to consider the relationship between mass, volume, and density. Density is mass divided by volume. Option a) has the same density as Earth, approximately 5.5 g/cm^3. Option b) explicitly states a density of 5.5 g/cm^3. Option c), a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive, would likely have a higher density due to increased gravitational compression, even though the exact density isn't specified. Option d) would have a lower density due to less gravitational compression. While option b) provides a specific density, option c) is likely to have a higher density due to the effects of gravitational compression on a more massive planet. Therefore, option c) is the most likely to have the highest density.\n\nAnswer:C)",
