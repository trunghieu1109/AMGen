### thinking by Debate Agent 755K:
To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the options based on their mass and size. Density is calculated as mass divided by volume. For option a, the density would be 1 g/cm^3 (mass = 1 Earth mass, volume = 1 Earth volume). For option b, the density is given as 5.5 g/cm^3. For option c, the density can be calculated considering that density scales with mass to the power of 1/3 for similar compositions; thus, a planet with 5 times the mass of Earth would have a density of about 5/3 = 1.67 g/cm^3. For option d, the density would be higher than Earth&#39;s since it has half the mass but the same volume, leading to a density of 2 g/cm^3. Therefore, option b with a density of 5.5 g/cm^3 is the highest.

### thinking by Debate Agent ERnq:
To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to calculate the density of each option. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. For spherical planets, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πr^3. Since options a, b, c, and d provide different masses and radii, we will evaluate each:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet has a density equal to Earth&#39;s density, which is approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3 has the same density as Earth.

c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth would have a larger volume, leading to a lower density. The density can be calculated as follows: 
   - Mass = 5 Earth masses = 5 * 5.5 g/cm^3 = 27.5 g/cm^3 (mass) 
   - Volume = (4/3)π(5^(1/3))^3 = 5 * Volume of Earth 
   - Density = Mass/Volume = (5 * 5.5)/(5) = 5.5 g/cm^3.

d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth would also have a lower density. 
   - Mass = 0.5 Earth masses = 0.5 * 5.5 g/cm^3 = 2.75 g/cm^3 (mass) 
   - Volume = (4/3)π(0.5^(1/3))^3 = 0.5 * Volume of Earth 
   - Density = Mass/Volume = (0.5 * 5.5)/(0.5) = 5.5 g/cm^3.

Thus, options a, b, and c have the same density, while option d has a lower density. Therefore, all planets in options a, b, and c have a density of 5.5 g/cm^3, but option c, being more massive, would still yield a density equal to Earth&#39;s. However, since option c is explicitly mentioned as having a density of 5.5 g/cm^3, it is not higher than the others. Therefore, the answer is that options a, b, and c have the same highest density, but since the question asks for the highest density and does not specify a tie, I will choose the first option that has the density stated as 5.5 g/cm^3.

To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to calculate the density of each option based on their mass and volume. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (density = mass/volume). We will compare the options:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet has a density similar to Earth&#39;s, approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3 is given directly.

c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth will have a larger volume, and since density decreases with increasing volume if mass increases, its density will be less than 5.5 g/cm^3.

d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth will also have a smaller volume than Earth, resulting in a higher density than Earth, but still lower than the density of option b (which is 5.5 g/cm^3).

Comparing the densities, option b has a defined density of 5.5 g/cm^3, which is equal to Earth&#39;s density, while option a is also similar to Earth&#39;s density. However, options c and d will have lower densities due to their mass and volume relationships. Therefore, the highest density among the options is for the planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm^3.

### thinking by Debate Agent iWQ8:
To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to calculate the density of each option. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. The volume of a sphere (which we can assume these planets are) is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3. Since density is mass/volume, we can express density in terms of mass and radius. For option a), the density is 1 g/cm^3 (since it has the same mass and radius as Earth). For option b), the density is given as 5.5 g/cm^3. For option c), if the planet is 5 times more massive than Earth, its volume would increase with the cube of the radius, leading to a lower density than Earth. For option d), the planet has half the mass of Earth and would also have a lower density than Earth. After evaluating all options, option b) has the highest density at 5.5 g/cm^3, while the others are lower or equal.

For option d, with half the mass of Earth, the density would be higher than Earth&#39;s but still lower than 5.5 g/cm^3.
