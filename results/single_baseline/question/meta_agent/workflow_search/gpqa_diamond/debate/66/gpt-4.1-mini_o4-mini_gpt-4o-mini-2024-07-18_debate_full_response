Expand |2,–1> in the uncoupled |m1,m2> basis: only m1+m2=–1 components appear, namely |0,–1> and |–1,0> with equal coefficients 1/√2. There is no |–1,–1> component, so its coefficient is zero and the probability is |0|^2=0.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:\nThe total state |l1=1,l2=1; l=2,m=-1> must be expanded in the product basis |m1,m2> with m1+m2=m=-1. The pair m1=m2=-1 would give m1+m2=-2, not -1, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero. Hence the joint probability of measuring m1=m2=-1 is 0.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:\nWe want the joint probability for measuring m1=m2=−1 in the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1; l=2, m=−1>. Only m1+m2=−1 components contribute. Possible (m1,m2) pairs: (0,−1) and (−1,0). There is no (−1,−1) component, so its coefficient is zero, giving zero probability.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:\nWe need the Clebsch–Gordan expansion of |l1=1,l2=1; l=2, m=-1> in the |m1,m2> basis. The only (m1,m2) pairs summing to m=–1 are (–1,0) and (0,–1). Neither gives (m1,m2)=(–1,–1), so its coefficient is zero. Hence the joint probability is zero.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zD6d:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent R0wp:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent nsjI:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pboY:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
