            "Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n",

        "response": "The problem involves finding the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\u0127 for a two-electron system in a p orbital with a given coupled angular momentum state |1, 1, 2, -1>. The possible values for m1 and m2 are -1, 0, and 1. The state |1, 1, 2, -1> is a linear combination of product states |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = -1. The combination m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would result in m = -2, which is not possible for m = -1. Therefore, the probability of both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
