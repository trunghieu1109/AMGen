Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital, each with an orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1. The coupled state is |1, 1, 2, -1>, where l = 2 and m = -1. We need to find the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. The possible m values for each electron are -1, 0, and 1. The total m = -1 can be achieved by combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. The combination m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 results in m = -2, which does not match the given m = -1. Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is 0, as confirmed by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state |1, 1, 2, -1>.
