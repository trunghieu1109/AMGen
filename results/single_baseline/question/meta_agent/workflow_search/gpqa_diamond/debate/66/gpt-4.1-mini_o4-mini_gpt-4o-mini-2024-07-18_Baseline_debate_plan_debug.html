    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent zD6d:
We need the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z equal to –ħ (i.e. m1=m2=–1) in the coupled state |l1=1,l2=1;L=2,M=–1&gt;. Expand |2,–1&gt; in the uncoupled |m1,m2&gt; basis: only m1+m2=–1 components appear, namely |0,–1&gt; and |–1,0&gt; with equal coefficients 1/√2. There is no |–1,–1&gt; component, so its coefficient is zero and the probability is |0|^2=0.

### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:
The total state |l1=1,l2=1; l=2,m=-1&gt; must be expanded in the product basis |m1,m2&gt; with m1+m2=m=-1. The pair m1=m2=-1 would give m1+m2=-2, not -1, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero. Hence the joint probability of measuring m1=m2=-1 is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:
We want the joint probability for measuring m1=m2=−1 in the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1; l=2, m=−1&gt;. Only m1+m2=−1 components contribute. Possible (m1,m2) pairs: (0,−1) and (−1,0). There is no (−1,−1) component, so its coefficient is zero, giving zero probability.

### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:
We need the Clebsch–Gordan expansion of |l1=1,l2=1; l=2, m=-1&gt; in the |m1,m2&gt; basis. The only (m1,m2) pairs summing to m=–1 are (–1,0) and (0,–1). Neither gives (m1,m2)=(–1,–1), so its coefficient is zero. Hence the joint probability is zero.
