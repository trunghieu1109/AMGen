    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent zD6d:
The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron are l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The coupled state is given by |1,1,2,-1&gt;, which indicates the total angular momentum quantum number l = 2 and the z-component m = -1. We need to find the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. In a coupled state |l1, l2, l, m&gt;, the state can be expressed as a linear combination of product states |m1, m2&gt;, where m1 and m2 are the z-components of the individual angular momenta. The condition for m1 and m2 is that they must sum to m, i.e., m1 + m2 = m. For m = -1, possible combinations are m1 = -1, m2 = 0 or m1 = 0, m2 = -1. The combination m1 = -1, m2 = -1 (which corresponds to both L1z and L2z having eigenvalues -ħ) sums to m = -2, which is not equal to m = -1. Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:
The problem involves a two-electron system where each electron is in a p orbital, meaning each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1. The coupled state is given as |l1, l2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum number and its z-component, respectively. We are asked to find the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} to have eigenvalues of -ℏ. The possible m values for each electron are -1, 0, and 1. The total m for the system is -1, which can be achieved by several combinations of m1 and m2. The combination where both m1 and m2 are -1 is one of these combinations. The probability of this specific configuration is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining the angular momenta. For the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the component |m1 = -1, m2 = -1&gt; is zero, as this configuration cannot contribute to a total m = -1 in a state with total l = 2. Therefore, the joint probability is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the quantum state of the two-electron system and how the measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta relates to the total angular momentum state. The given state is |l1, l2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. The quantum numbers l1 and l2 are both 1, indicating that each electron is in a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its z-component m is -1. We want to find the joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ. In the given state, the total z-component m = -1 is the sum of the individual z-components m1 and m2. For m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, m1 + m2 = -2, which does not match the given m = -1. Therefore, the probability of this combination is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:
In this problem, we are dealing with the coupling of angular momentum for two electrons in a p orbital. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l_1 = l_2 = 1. The coupled state is given as |l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. We want to find the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ. In the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, the total magnetic quantum number m is -1. We need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m1, m2&gt;, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers of the individual electrons. The possible values for m1 and m2 are -1, 0, and 1. The state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2&gt; states, specifically |0, -1&gt;, |-1, 0&gt;, and |-1, -1&gt;. The state |-1, -1&gt; corresponds to both L_{1z} and L_{2z} being -ħ. The probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is given by the square of the coefficient of |-1, -1&gt; in the expansion of |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. For the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, the coefficient of |-1, -1&gt; is 0, so the probability is 0.
