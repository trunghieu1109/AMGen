The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron are l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The coupled state is given by |1,1,2,-1>, which indicates the total angular momentum quantum number l = 2 and the z-component m = -1. We need to find the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. In a coupled state |l1, l2, l, m>, the state can be expressed as a linear combination of product states |m1, m2>, where m1 and m2 are the z-components of the individual angular momenta. The condition for m1 and m2 is that they must sum to m, i.e., m1 + m2 = m. For m = -1, possible combinations are m1 = -1, m2 = 0 or m1 = 0, m2 = -1. The combination m1 = -1, m2 = -1 (which corresponds to both L1z and L2z having eigenvalues -ħ) sums to m = -2, which is not equal to m = -1. Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is 0.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:\nThe problem involves a two-electron system where each electron is in a p orbital, meaning each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1. The coupled state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum number and its z-component, respectively. We are asked to find the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} to have eigenvalues of -ℏ. The possible m values for each electron are -1, 0, and 1. The total m for the system is -1, which can be achieved by several combinations of m1 and m2. The combination where both m1 and m2 are -1 is one of these combinations. The probability of this specific configuration is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining the angular momenta. For the state |1, 1, 2, -1>, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the component |m1 = -1, m2 = -1> is zero, as this configuration cannot contribute to a total m = -1 in a state with total l = 2. Therefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the quantum state of the two-electron system and how the measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta relates to the total angular momentum state. The given state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. The quantum numbers l1 and l2 are both 1, indicating that each electron is in a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its z-component m is -1. We want to find the joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ. In the given state, the total z-component m = -1 is the sum of the individual z-components m1 and m2. For m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, m1 + m2 = -2, which does not match the given m = -1. Therefore, the probability of this combination is 0.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:\nIn this problem, we are dealing with the coupling of angular momentum for two electrons in a p orbital. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l_1 = l_2 = 1. The coupled state is given as |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. We want to find the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ. In the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1>, the total magnetic quantum number m is -1. We need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m1, m2>, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers of the individual electrons. The possible values for m1 and m2 are -1, 0, and 1. The state |1, 1, 2, -1> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states, specifically |0, -1>, |-1, 0>, and |-1, -1>. The state |-1, -1> corresponds to both L_{1z} and L_{2z} being -ħ. The probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is given by the square of the coefficient of |-1, -1> in the expansion of |1, 1, 2, -1>. For the state |1, 1, 2, -1>, the coefficient of |-1, -1> is 0, so the probability is 0.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zD6d:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent R0wp:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent nsjI:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pboY:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
