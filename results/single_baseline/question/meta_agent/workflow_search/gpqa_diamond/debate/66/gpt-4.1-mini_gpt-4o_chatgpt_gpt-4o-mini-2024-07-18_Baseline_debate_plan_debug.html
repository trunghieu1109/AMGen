    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent zD6d:
In a coupled angular momentum state, the total angular momentum quantum numbers are given, and we need to find the probability of certain individual angular momentum components. Given the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, this is a state with total angular momentum quantum number l = 2 and z-component m = -1. For two electrons in a p orbital, l1 = l2 = 1. The possible values of m1 and m2 that satisfy m1 + m2 = m are combinations that add up to -1. The specific combination of m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is needed to find the joint probability. However, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would give m = -2, which is not possible for m = -1. Therefore, the probability of L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:
The given state is |l1, l2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. For two particles with l1 = l2 = 1, the possible values of m1 and m2 (the z-component of the angular momentum for each particle) are -1, 0, and 1. We are interested in finding the probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which means both particles have Lz = -ħ. The total angular momentum m = m1 + m2 = -1, which can be achieved with the combinations (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). The state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; is a linear combination of these possible states, but the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; is specifically symmetric under particle exchange and has a specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each combination. The probability amplitude for the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; to be in the state |1, 1, -1, -1&gt; is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states to form a total l=2 state with m=-1. This coefficient is 1/√3 for the symmetric combination, hence the probability is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. The joint probability of getting m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is 1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:
The problem involves a two-electron system in a p orbital, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1. The total angular momentum state is given by |l1, l2, l, m&gt; = |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;. The task is to find the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ. For individual p orbitals, m can be -1, 0, or 1. The state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; is a linear combination of product states |m1, m2&gt; such that m1 + m2 = m, and the total m here is -1. The possible combinations are |0, -1&gt; and |-1, 0&gt;. The combination |-1, -1&gt; is not possible as it would give m = -2, which is not equal to -1. Therefore, the probability of obtaining |-1, -1&gt; is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:
To find the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we need to consider the possible values of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$ where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the angular momentum for particles 1 and 2 respectively. Since $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, $m_1$ and $m_2$ can take values $-1, 0, 1$. We are interested in the case where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The state $|1,1,2,-1&gt;$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2&gt;$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The specific combination for $|1,1,2,-1&gt;$ is $|1,1,2,-1&gt; = rac{1}{oot 6}(|1,-2&gt; + |0,-1&gt; - oot 2 |-1,0&gt;)$. The coefficient of the $|-1,-1&gt;$ term is zero, indicating that this combination does not contribute to $|1,1,2,-1&gt;$. Therefore, the probability of both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.
