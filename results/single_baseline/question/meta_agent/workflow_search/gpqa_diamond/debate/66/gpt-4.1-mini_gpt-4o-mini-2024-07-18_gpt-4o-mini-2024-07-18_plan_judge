Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1>, both electrons are in p orbitals, meaning their individual angular momentum quantum numbers are l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron are -\hbar, 0, and +\hbar, corresponding to m = -1, 0, +1. To find the joint probability of both L_{1z} and L_{2z} being -\hbar, we need to consider the allowed combinations of m values. The total m = -1 can be achieved by combinations such as (-1, 0) or (0, -1), but not by both being -1 simultaneously due to the restrictions of the quantum state. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\hbar is 0, as there is no valid state configuration that allows both electrons to have -\hbar simultaneously in the given coupled state. Thus, the final answer is 0.
