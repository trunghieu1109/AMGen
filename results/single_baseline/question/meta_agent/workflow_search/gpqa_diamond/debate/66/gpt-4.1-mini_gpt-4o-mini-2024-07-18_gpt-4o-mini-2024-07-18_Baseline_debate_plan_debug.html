    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent R0wp:
In this scenario, we have two electrons in a p orbital state, which means each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number of l = 1. The possible eigenvalues for the z-component of orbital angular momentum, L_z, for each electron are given by m, which can take values of -1, 0, and +1 for l = 1. The joint state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt; indicates that the total angular momentum l = 2 and m = -1. For both electrons to have L_{1z} = -\hbar and L_{2z} = -\hbar, we need to determine the probability of obtaining these values. The eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} are -\hbar for m = -1. Since each electron can independently take the value -1 with a probability of 1/3 (as there are three possible m values: -1, 0, +1), the joint probability of both electrons having L_{1z} = -\hbar and L_{2z} = -\hbar is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. However, we must consider the normalization of the total state and the fact that the combined system is represented in a specific coupled state. Thus, the probability of measuring both electrons with L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\hbar is 0 because there is no state contributing to this measurement in the given coupled state.

### thinking by Debate Agent nsjI:
In the given state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, the values of l1 and l2 are both 1, which corresponds to p orbitals. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron are given by m values, which can take on -1, 0, or +1 for p orbitals. Since we are interested in the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\hbar, we need to find the joint probability of both electrons being in the state corresponding to m = -1. In the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, the total m = -1 indicates that the combined state can be achieved by both electrons being in the m = -1 state. The joint probability of measuring -\hbar for both L_{1z} and L_{2z} is thus the probability of both electrons being in the m = -1 state, which is 1/2 for each electron since they can also be in m = 0 or +1 states. Therefore, the joint probability of both being in m = -1 is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but since we are considering only the state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, it is 1/2 for each electron. Hence, the correct answer is 1/2.

### thinking by Debate Agent pboY:
In the given state |1,1,2,-1&gt;, both electrons are in p orbitals, which means their individual angular momentum quantum numbers (l1 and l2) are both equal to 1. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for a p orbital (l=1) are -\hbar, 0, and +\hbar. For the joint probability of obtaining -\hbar for both L_{1z} and L_{2z}, we need to consider the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients that describe the coupling of two angular momenta. The total state |l, m&gt; with l=2 and m=-1 must be decomposed into the product states |l1, m1&gt; |l2, m2&gt;. The only combinations that yield m=-1 are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) or (0, -1). However, the probability of both being -\hbar is given by the square of the amplitude of the relevant states, which corresponds to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. In this case, since both electrons cannot simultaneously have -\hbar due to the restrictions of the quantum numbers, the joint probability is 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent z26p:
In the given state |1,1,2,-1&gt;, the individual angular momentum quantum numbers l1 and l2 for both electrons are 1. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron (in p orbitals) are given by m = -1, 0, +1. Since we want the joint probability of both L_{1z} and L_{2z} being -\hbar, we need to consider how many combinations yield this result. For each electron, the probability of measuring -\hbar (corresponding to m = -1) is 1/3, since there are three possible outcomes (-1, 0, +1). The joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. However, we need to check the given choices to find the closest match. The only relevant choice that could fit this scenario is 1/2, assuming the state allows for such a combination. Thus, the probability is not straightforwardly calculated as there might be a normalization or additional considerations from the coupling, but based on the choices, the most plausible answer would be 1/2.

    <pre>In the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1&gt;, both electrons are in p orbitals, meaning their individual angular momentum quantum numbers are l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron are -\hbar, 0, and +\hbar, corresponding to m = -1, 0, +1. To find the joint probability of both L_{1z} and L_{2z} being -\hbar, we need to consider the allowed combinations of m values. The total m = -1 can be achieved by combinations such as (-1, 0) or (0, -1), but not by both being -1 simultaneously due to the restrictions of the quantum state. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\hbar is 0, as there is no valid state configuration that allows both electrons to have -\hbar simultaneously in the given coupled state. Thus, the final answer is 0.
