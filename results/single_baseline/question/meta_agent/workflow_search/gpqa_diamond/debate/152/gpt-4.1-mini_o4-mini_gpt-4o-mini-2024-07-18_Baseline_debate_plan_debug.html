    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --&gt;(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --&gt; (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---&gt; 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FAIl:
First, consider reaction A: dimethyl malonate enolate attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate at the β-carbon, giving a trimethyl tricarboxylate whose malonate-derived carbon (bearing two CO2Me) becomes C1, the acceptor ester gives CO2Me at C3, and the p-tolyl substituent is at C2. That matches trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Reaction B: the cyclohexenyl piperidine enamine adds in a Michael fashion to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and subsequent acidic workup hydrolyzes the enamine to the ketone, giving 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Reaction C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione (not its enol) in base conjugate-adds to but-3-en-2-one to yield 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

These assignments correspond to choice4.

### thinking by Debate Agent Xr0T:
First Michael addition: dimethyl malonate adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate giving trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (choice1 and 4 A’s are wrong because they mis-place the p-tolyl and ester positions). Second: the enamine from cyclohexanone attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile, then hydrolysis gives the ketonitrile 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (choice2 and 3 B’s with enol/hydroxy are wrong). Third: the Michael donor is cyclohexane-1,3-dione (not its enol), so C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Only choice4 matches all three.

### thinking by Debate Agent sEs6:
First reaction: dimethyl malonate (enolate) adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate to give a trimethyl propane-tricarboxylate bearing a p-tolyl substituent on the central carbon.  Second reaction: the cyclohexenyl piperidine enamine adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, then hydrolysis regenerates the ketone, yielding 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.  Third reaction: the active methylene nucleophile is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which in base adds to but-3-en-2-one giving 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  Matching these to the given choices gives choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0HQe:
First, for reaction A the malonate anion CH(CO2Me)2 attacks the β–carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate to give a saturated adduct bearing three ester groups: two from the malonate and one from the original acrylate.  The correct tricarboxylate is propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate and the base and acid workup leave the keto and aryl substituents intact.  In the four choices only 1 and 4 have the correct 1,1,3 numbering.  Choice 4 calls the adduct “trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate”; although one might argue over the position numbering of the p-Tol group, this choice at least has the two esters at C1 and one at C3.

In reaction B the enamine derived from cyclohexanone (1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine) adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile at the β-carbon and, after hydrolysis, gives the ketone 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.  Only choices 1 and 4 give that product.

Finally, in reaction C the active methylene of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (which exists predominantly as its enol, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione) Michael-adds to but-3-en-2-one to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  Choice 4 lists C correctly as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Thus the only choice with B and C perfectly correct and a defensible A is choice 4, i.e. D).

    <pre>For A, dimethyl malonate enolate adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate giving trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For B, the enamine from cyclohexanone adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, then hydrolysis yields 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For C, cyclohexane-1,3-dione undergoes Michael addition to but-3-en-2-one giving 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Only choice 4 matches all three products.
