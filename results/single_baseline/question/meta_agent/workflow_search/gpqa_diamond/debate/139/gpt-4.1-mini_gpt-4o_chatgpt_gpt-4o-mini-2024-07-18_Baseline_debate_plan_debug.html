### thinking by Debate Agent M1T9:
To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X, liquid Y, gas W, precipitate G, and substance B. Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and is a reagent in organic chemistry. A common reagent with isotopes is deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, suggesting Substance X could be heavy water (D2O). Liquid Y reacts with X to release gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons; this suggests gas W is diatomic hydrogen (H2) or deuterium (D2). The precipitate G forms, which releases B upon heating, and B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is 4°C, suggesting B is water (H2O). The reaction of a keto acid with Substance X (D2O) would replace hydrogen with deuterium, containing 2 oxygen atoms. The lightest element in D2O is deuterium (2 amu) and the heaviest is oxygen (16 amu). The total atomic mass of all deuterium (2 atoms) is 4 amu, and oxygen is 16 amu. Summing these gives 20 amu. However, considering isotopes, deuterium (2) and tritium (3) as heavier isotopes, the cumulative mass is 2 + 3 + 16 = 21 amu. The closest choice to 21 is 25.

### thinking by Debate Agent uU0Q:
To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X and its components. Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, suggesting it might involve an element like deuterium (heavy hydrogen). The violent reaction with liquid Y releases a gas W, which has equal numbers of neutrons and protons, indicating it could be diatomic hydrogen (H2) or a similar molecule. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K, likely water (H2O, 0°C or 273 K melting point). Substance X is used in organic chemistry, hinting at a reagent like Grignard reagent (RMgX, where R is an organic group and X is a halogen). The reaction with a keto acid forming a product with two oxygens suggests the presence of an ester or similar compound. Hence, Substance X might be a compound like CH3MgBr where magnesium (Mg) is the heavy element. The lightest element is hydrogen (H). The cumulative atomic masses of hydrogen (1 amu) and magnesium (24 amu) sum to 25 amu.

To solve this, we first need to identify Substance X. It is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons, suggesting it is diatomic hydrogen (H2), which has 1 proton and 1 neutron per atom. The precipitate G forms and releases B when heated, with B having a melting point close to 277 K. This is likely water (H2O), as it freezes at 273 K. Substance X is often used as a reagent in organic chemistry, suggesting it could be a halogen or a compound like D2O (heavy water), which incorporates the heavier isotope deuterium. Heavy water reacts with keto acids, and D2O is used in organic chemistry. The lightest element in D2O is hydrogen (deuterium), with an atomic mass of approximately 2 (considering both isotopes H and D), and the heaviest element is oxygen, with an atomic mass of 16. Summing these gives 2 (H) + 2 (D) + 16 (O) = 20. However, the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, considering all isotopes. If we assume the presence of another element with a heavier isotope, let&#39;s consider the possibility of an element like chlorine (Cl) with isotopes 35 and 37, making the sum 2 (H) + 16 (O) + 35 (Cl) + 37 (Cl) = 90. Evaluating the choices, none directly match, but 35 is a possible answer if we consider the halogen chlorine with its common isotopes.

### thinking by Debate Agent zb4Y:
First, identify Substance X. It incorporates a heavier isotope and reacts with liquid Y to release gas W and precipitate G. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons, suggesting it could be a noble gas like Helium (2 protons, 2 neutrons). Precipitate G releases B upon heating, with B having a melting point near 277 K, likely water (273 K). Substance X is likely a halogen, possibly Chlorine, which has isotopes 35 and 37. The reaction with a keto acid suggests a halogen like Chlorine, used in organic chemistry as a reagent. The lightest element in Chlorine is Hydrogen (1), and the heaviest is Chlorine itself (35.5). Summing the atomic masses of the lightest (1) and heaviest (35.5) elements gives 36.5, but considering the isotopes, the cumulative atomic mass of Chlorine isotopes (35 and 37) is 72. Adding the atomic mass of Hydrogen (1), the total is 73. However, the choices provided do not match this calculation directly, and it seems there might be a misalignment in the interpretation of the isotopes or elements involved. Given the options, the closest logical choice with the cumulative atomic masses considered is 35.

    <pre>The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. A common candidate for such a substance is heavy water (D2O), where deuterium is the heavier isotope of hydrogen. The reaction with liquid Y releases gas W, which has equal numbers of protons and neutrons, suggesting it could be diatomic hydrogen (H2) or deuterium (D2). The precipitate G releases B upon heating, with B having a melting point near 277 K, likely water (H2O). The reaction with a keto acid suggests the presence of oxygen, consistent with D2O. The lightest element in D2O is deuterium (2 amu) and the heaviest is oxygen (16 amu). The cumulative atomic mass of deuterium (considering isotopes H and D) is 2 + 3 = 5, and oxygen is 16. Summing these gives 21 amu. However, considering the choices, the closest match is 25, which could account for additional isotopic considerations or a different interpretation of the elements involved.
