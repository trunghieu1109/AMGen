    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;29&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;25&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;35&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;31&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent M1T9:
Substance X reacts violently with water (liquid Y) to give D2 gas (gas W, equal protons and neutrons) and a precipitate of metal hydroxides, which upon heating release heavy water D2O (B), mp ≈277 K = 3.82 °C. The reagent and its analog are LiAlD4 (the deuteride analog of LiAlH4) used in organic chemistry. LiAlD4 contains Al (atomic mass ≈26.98) and four deuterium atoms (D, mass ≈2.014 each). The heaviest element is Al (one atom: 26.98) and the lightest is D (four atoms: 4×2.014=8.056). Summing gives ≈35.036 ≈35.

### thinking by Debate Agent uU0Q:
We identify Substance X as the deuterated analog of lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlD4 (the analog of the common organic reagent LiAlH4). It contains one Al atom (mass ≈26.98 u) and four deuterium atoms (mass ≈2.014 u each). The lightest element present is deuterium (D), with four atoms: total mass ≈4×2.014=8.056 u. The heaviest element is Al: mass ≈26.98 u. Summing these cumulative masses gives ≈8.056+26.98≈35.036, which rounds to 35.

### thinking by Debate Agent XYqr:
Substance X releases D2 gas (each D has 1 proton &amp; 1 neutron), and precipitate G (metal deuteroxides) heated gives D2O (mp ≈ 277 K). X must be lithium aluminium deuteride, LiAlD4; its close analog LiAlH4 is a common organic reagent. The lightest element present is deuterium (4 atoms), total mass ≈4×2=8; the heaviest is aluminium (1 atom), mass ≈27. Summing these gives 8+27=35.

### thinking by Debate Agent zb4Y:
We identify B as D2O (heavy water) because its melting point is ≈277 K. Substance X must be lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD4, a deuterated analog of LiAlH4 used in organic chemistry. It reacts violently with H2O (liquid Y) to release D2 (gas W; each D has 1 p+1 n so D2 has equal p and n), and forms Al(OD)3 (G), which on heating releases D2O (B). The lightest element in LiAlD4 is deuterium (D; atomic mass ≈2) present in 4 atoms → cumulative mass =4×2=8. The heaviest is Al (≈27) present once → cumulative mass =27. Sum =8+27=35.

    <pre>We identify Substance X as lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). Reacting with water yields D2 gas (each deuteron has equal protons and neutrons) and Al(OD)3, which upon heating gives D2O (heavy water) with a melting point near 277 K. LiAlD4 consists of one Al atom (atomic mass ≈26.98 u) and four deuterium atoms (each ≈2.014 u). The lightest element is deuterium (total mass ≈4 × 2.014 = 8.056 u) and the heaviest is aluminum (≈26.98 u). Summing these gives ≈35.036, which corresponds to 35.
