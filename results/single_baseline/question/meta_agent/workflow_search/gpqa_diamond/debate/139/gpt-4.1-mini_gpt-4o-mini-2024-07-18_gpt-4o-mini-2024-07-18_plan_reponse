            "Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.",

        "response": "To determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, we analyze the clues provided. Substance X is likely an organic compound involving elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and possibly oxygen or nitrogen. The lightest element is typically hydrogen (H) with an atomic mass of approximately 1, while the heaviest could be carbon (C) with an atomic mass of approximately 12 or nitrogen (N) with an atomic mass of approximately 14. The cumulative atomic mass would be the sum of these two. After evaluating the options given (29, 25, 35, 31), the most plausible cumulative atomic mass based on common organic chemistry compounds and the isotopes involved leads us to conclude that the answer is 31, which could represent the sum of lighter and heavier isotopes of carbon and oxygen. Therefore, the final answer is D.\n\nAnswer:D",
