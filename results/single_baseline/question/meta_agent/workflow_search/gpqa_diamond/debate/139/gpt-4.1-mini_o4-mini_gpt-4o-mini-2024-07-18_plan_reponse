            "Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.",

        "response": "We identify Substance X as lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). Reacting with water yields D2 gas (each deuteron has equal protons and neutrons) and Al(OD)3, which upon heating gives D2O (heavy water) with a melting point near 277 K. LiAlD4 consists of one Al atom (atomic mass \u224826.98 u) and four deuterium atoms (each \u22482.014 u). The lightest element is deuterium (total mass \u22484 \u00d7 2.014 = 8.056 u) and the heaviest is aluminum (\u224826.98 u). Summing these gives \u224835.036, which corresponds to 35.\n\nAnswer:C)",
