Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope and is used in organic chemistry. The reaction details suggest that Substance X could be a compound like DCl, where deuterium (D) is the heavier isotope of hydrogen. The gas W released is likely diatomic hydrogen (H2), and the precipitate G could be a chloride compound. The melting point of B suggests it could be water, but the closest match is sodium, which is not exact. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X need to be calculated. The lightest element is hydrogen (1 amu), and the heaviest is chlorine, with isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Summing the isotopes of chlorine gives 35 + 37 = 72 amu. However, considering the choices, the cumulative mass of the lightest (hydrogen) and the heaviest single isotope (Cl-35) is 1 + 35 = 36. The closest choice to this calculation is 35, which suggests a focus on the most common isotope of chlorine. Therefore, the answer is 35.
