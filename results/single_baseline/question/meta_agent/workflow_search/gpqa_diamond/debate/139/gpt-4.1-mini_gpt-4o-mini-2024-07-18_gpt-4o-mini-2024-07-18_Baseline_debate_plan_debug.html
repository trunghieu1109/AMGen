### thinking by Debate Agent QXYq:
To solve the problem, we need to identify the elements involved in Substance X and their isotopes. The question implies that Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements, suggesting that it might be a compound containing oxygen (O), carbon (C), or another common element in organic chemistry. The mention of a gas W with equal numbers of neutrons and protons indicates it could be a simple molecule like nitrogen (N2) or hydrogen (H2). The precipitate G, which releases B upon heating, and the melting point of B being close to 277 K, suggests that B could be a common organic compound or a simple inorganic compound. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X should be calculated based on the atomic masses of the elements involved. After analyzing the choices, the most reasonable cumulative atomic mass based on common organic chemistry compounds is 31, which could represent the sum of lighter and heavier isotopes of carbon and oxygen, for example.

### thinking by Debate Agent rzb4:
To solve the problem, we need to identify Substance X and its constituents. Given the hints about isotopes, reactions, and the properties of gas W and precipitate G, we can deduce that Substance X is likely a compound involving carbon and possibly nitrogen, given its use in organic chemistry. The release of gas W, which has equal neutrons and protons, suggests it could be a simple molecule like nitrogen (N2) or hydrogen (H2). The precipitate G and the product containing 2 oxygen atoms further guide us. The melting point of B being close to 277 K may refer to a specific compound, but we focus on the atomic masses of the elements in Substance X. We will sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements found in Substance X. The atomic masses of elements commonly found in organic compounds are as follows: Carbon (C) ~12, Hydrogen (H) ~1, Oxygen (O) ~16, and Nitrogen (N) ~14. The lightest is Hydrogen (1) and the heaviest could be Carbon (12) or Nitrogen (14). Thus, the cumulative atomic masses are 1 (H) + 14 (N) = 15. However, we need to check for the specific options given: 29, 25, 35, and 31. Since none of these match 15 directly, we will need to consider potential combinations of elements or isotopes that could yield a higher cumulative mass. After analyzing the options, the most plausible cumulative mass based on common elements in organic compounds would be 29 (considering heavier isotopes or combinations).

### thinking by Debate Agent YiYu:
To solve the problem, we need to identify Substance X and its elements based on the clues provided. The key points are: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope, reacts violently with liquid Y, releases gas W with equal protons and neutrons, forms a precipitate G that releases B when heated, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. The reaction product with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. The context suggests that Substance X is likely to be an organic reagent, possibly containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X need to be calculated. After analyzing the options given, the correct cumulative atomic mass is determined to be 31, which corresponds to the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X.

### thinking by Debate Agent LEBL:
To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X and its elements based on the clues provided. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, which suggests it may be a halogen or similar element. The gas W released has an equal number of neutrons and protons, indicating it could be a simple molecule like hydrogen (H2) or helium (He). The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K, likely indicating it&#39;s a common compound like water (H2O) or carbon dioxide (CO2). The mention of a keto acid reacting with Substance X suggests it could be a carboxylic acid or similar compound. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X need to be calculated, considering their isotopes. After analyzing the options and the context, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements lead us to the answer. The correct choice is based on these calculations.

    <pre>To determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, we analyze the clues provided. Substance X is likely an organic compound involving elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and possibly oxygen or nitrogen. The lightest element is typically hydrogen (H) with an atomic mass of approximately 1, while the heaviest could be carbon (C) with an atomic mass of approximately 12 or nitrogen (N) with an atomic mass of approximately 14. The cumulative atomic mass would be the sum of these two. After evaluating the options given (29, 25, 35, 31), the most plausible cumulative atomic mass based on common organic chemistry compounds and the isotopes involved leads us to conclude that the answer is 31, which could represent the sum of lighter and heavier isotopes of carbon and oxygen. Therefore, the final answer is D.
