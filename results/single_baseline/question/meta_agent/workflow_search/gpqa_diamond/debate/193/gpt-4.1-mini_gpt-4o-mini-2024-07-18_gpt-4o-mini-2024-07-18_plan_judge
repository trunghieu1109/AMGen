Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins, we analyze the possible configurations of the spins, each of which can be +1 or -1. This results in 2^3 = 8 configurations. The energy for each configuration is calculated using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. By evaluating the energies for all configurations and applying the Boltzmann factor e^(-E/kT), we can sum these contributions to derive the partition function. After careful evaluation, the correct expression for the partition function matches choice 1: Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ).
