Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the partition function Z, we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1. There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. For each configuration, we calculate the energy E using the given formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Then, we compute the Boltzmann factor e^(-beta*E) for each configuration and sum them up to get the partition function Z. By calculating the energies for all configurations, we find that there are 2 configurations with E = -3J, and 6 configurations with E = J. Thus, Z = 2e^(3J\beta) + 6e^(-J\beta), which matches choice A.
