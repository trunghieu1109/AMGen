Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction involves an enamine, which can undergo deprotonation, alkylation, and hydrolysis. The sequence of reagents typically involves using LDA to deprotonate the enamine, followed by alkylation with an alkyl halide like CH3CH2I, and finally hydrolysis with H3O+ to regenerate the carbonyl compound. The choices provided suggest different sequences and products. Analyzing the choices, the correct sequence of reagents is LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+, which matches the typical enamine reaction pathway. The expected product after these steps is a ketone, specifically heptan-4-one, as the enamine originally derived from pentan-2-one will have an ethyl group added at the 4-position. Therefore, the correct choice is D.
