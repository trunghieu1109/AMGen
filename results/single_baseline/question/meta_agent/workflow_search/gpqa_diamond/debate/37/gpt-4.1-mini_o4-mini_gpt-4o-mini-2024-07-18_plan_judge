Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The enamine (iminium) derived from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine undergoes α-alkylation via (i) LDA in DME to form the enolate, (ii) CH₃CH₂I to install the ethyl group at the α-position, and (iii) H₃O⁺ to hydrolyze back to the ketone. This yields the C₄-ethylated ketone heptan-4-one. The correct step sequence and product correspond to choice 4, which is D).
