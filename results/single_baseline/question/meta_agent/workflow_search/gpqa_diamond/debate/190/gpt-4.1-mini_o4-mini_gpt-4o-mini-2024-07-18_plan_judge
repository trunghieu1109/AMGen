Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Step 1: NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl, and BnBr installs a benzyl ether at C3, retaining the prop-1-en-2-yl at C5. Step 2: p-TsNHNH2/HCl converts the C1 ketone into the tosylhydrazone. Step 3: n-BuLi (Shapiro reaction) eliminates the hydrazone to form an alkene at C1â€“C2, giving a cyclohexene with benzyl ether at C3 and prop-1-en-2-yl at C5. Step 4: H2/Pd hydrogenates both the ring alkene and the isopropenyl to isopropyl, and cleaves the benzyl ether, restoring the free CH2OH at C3. The final product is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexane, i.e. (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, which corresponds to choice A).
