            "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.",

        "response": "We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic isomers showing only two aromatic singlets (each 2\u2009H) at 6.7\u2009ppm, meaning each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons. Of the four candidates, only the symmetric tetramethylbenzenes 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene each give a single aromatic singlet. The methyl region displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (12H\u2009:\u20096H\u2009:\u20096H), consistent with two isomers each having two methyl environments, one pair overlapping (12H) and the other pairs separate (6H each). Hence the mixture is 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:D)",
