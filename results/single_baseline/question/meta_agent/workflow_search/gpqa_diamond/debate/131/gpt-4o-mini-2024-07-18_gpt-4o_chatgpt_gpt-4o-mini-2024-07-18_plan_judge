Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating two equivalent sets of aromatic protons in each compound. The signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest the presence of methyl groups in different environments. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has aromatic protons in a 1:1 ratio and methyl groups in a 2:1:1 ratio. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene also fits this pattern. Therefore, the compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This reasoning is supported by the majority of the debate agents.
