Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic isomers showing only two aromatic singlets (each 2 H) at 6.7 ppm, meaning each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons. Of the four candidates, only the symmetric tetramethylbenzenes 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene each give a single aromatic singlet. The methyl region displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (12H : 6H : 6H), consistent with two isomers each having two methyl environments, one pair overlapping (12H) and the other pairs separate (6H each). Hence the mixture is 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.
