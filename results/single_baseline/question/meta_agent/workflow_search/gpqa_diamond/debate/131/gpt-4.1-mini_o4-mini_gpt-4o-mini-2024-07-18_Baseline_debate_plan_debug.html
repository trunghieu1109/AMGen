    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent KNDF:
We need two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Each compound must have a single aromatic environment (two equivalent ring H’s), giving one singlet. Which tetramethylbenzenes have that symmetry? 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene each have a C2 (or mirror) symmetry that makes their two ring protons equivalent, so each gives one aromatic singlet. The unsymmetric 1,2,3,5 isomer would give two aromatic signals. Diethylbenzene would show CH2/CH3 splitting, not singlets. Thus the mixture is 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, choice 4 (D).

### thinking by Debate Agent PqsM:
We observe two aromatic singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 integration ratio, meaning each compound contributes a single aromatic environment (2 H each), so both are highly symmetric tetramethylbenzenes whose two ring‐H are equivalent and isolated (hence singlets). Of the four isomers given, only 1,2,4,5‐ and 1,2,3,4‐tetramethylbenzene each have C2v symmetry making their two aromatic H equivalent and noncoupling. In the methyl region we see three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (i.e. 4 CH3, 2 CH3, 2 CH3 when combined then normalized to 2:1:1), consistent with two 2‐set methyl environments per isomer with one overlap between the isomers, giving three observed signals. Thus the mixture is 1,2,4,5‐ and 1,2,3,4‐tetramethylbenzene.

### thinking by Debate Agent MlmI:
We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatics, showing only two aromatic singlets (1:1) at 6.7 ppm → each compound must have exactly one aromatic H environment (2 H each) that appears as a singlet (i.e., two equivalent isolated protons). Among the candidates only the two fully symmetrical tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene) each give one aromatic singlet (2 H). The methyl region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (i.e. 12H,6H,6H), indicating four methyls of one type (12H) and two each of two other types (6H each), matching a 1:1 mix where one methyl signal from each compound coincides (12H), and the other two remain separate (6H each). Therefore the mixture is 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ztkd:
We have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic isomers. Each compound gives a single aromatic singlet (2H) so the two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio arise from two isomers each with equivalent protons. The three methyl singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio could come from overlapping methyl signals if each isomer has two equivalent Me‐environments (6H each), giving four distinct Me signals that overlap to net three signals (one overlap gives 12H; the others 6H each for a 2:1:1 ratio). The only pair of tetramethylbenzenes with one aromatic signal and two Me signals each are the 1,2,4,5- and the 1,2,3,4-isomers, matching choice 4.
