Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine which two compounds are present in the mixture, we analyze the NMR data. The two singlets at around 6.7 ppm indicate that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons, likely from two different aromatic compounds, present in equal amounts. The three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest different types of protons in the aliphatic region. The compounds must have distinct chemical environments for the protons to give rise to these signals. The first choice, '1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', fits the criteria as both compounds can produce the observed signals due to their symmetrical structures and the correct ratios. The other options do not match the expected ratios or do not provide the correct number of signals. Therefore, the most plausible combination is the first choice.
