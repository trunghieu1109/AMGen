Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The radiation from a symmetric spheroidal oscillation has no net dipole moment, so the leading term is quadrupole: dP/dΩ∝ω⁶ sin²θ cos²θ∝λ⁻⁶ sin²θ cos²θ. This peaks at θ=45° (sin²θ cos²θ=1/4), and at θ=30° one gets sin²30° cos²30°=(1/4)(3/4)=3/16, i.e. (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4 of the maximum A. Hence the correct choice is “3/4, λ^(−6)”.
