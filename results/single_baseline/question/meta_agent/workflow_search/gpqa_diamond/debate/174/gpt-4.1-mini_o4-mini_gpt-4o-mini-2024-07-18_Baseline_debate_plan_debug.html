    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 0Lip:
For a spheroidal oscillating charge (dipole-like), the far‐field power per solid angle ∝ sin^2θ·ω^4. The maximum occurs at θ=90°, so fraction at θ=30° is sin^2(30°)=1/4. Since ω=2πc/λ, ω^4∝λ^(−4). Thus the correct choice is 1/4, λ^(−4), i.e. option 3, which is C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 6JIV:
The spheroidal distribution oscillating along z acts like an electric dipole oriented along z. The dipole radiation pattern in the far field is dP/dΩ ∝ p₀²ω⁴sin²θ ∝ sin²θ/λ⁴, with maximum at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4. Thus the fraction of the maximum A is 1/4 and the λ‐dependence is λ⁻⁴, corresponding to choice 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3yZ1:
The angular distribution of dipole radiation varies as sin^2θ, giving a fraction at θ=30° of sin^2(30°)=1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4∝λ^(−4). Thus the correct choice is 1/4 and λ^(−4), which is choice 3 (C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 7D3Z:
We have an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution (axisymmetric about z) with no net dipole moment, so the leading radiation is quadrupole. The angular distribution for electric quadrupole radiation from an axisymmetric Q̈ with Q̈_xx=Q̈_yy=−Q̈_zz/2 gives dP/dΩ∝sin^2θ cos^2θ. This peaks at θ=45° with value ∝1/4 (taking the peak as A), and at θ=30° sin^2 30° cos^2 30°=(1/4)(3/4)=3/16, so the fraction is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4. The wavelength dependence for quadrupole radiation goes as ω^6∝λ^(−6). Thus the correct choice is 3/4, λ^(−6), i.e. choice2

    <pre>The radiation from a symmetric spheroidal oscillation has no net dipole moment, so the leading term is quadrupole: dP/dΩ∝ω⁶ sin²θ cos²θ∝λ⁻⁶ sin²θ cos²θ. This peaks at θ=45° (sin²θ cos²θ=1/4), and at θ=30° one gets sin²30° cos²30°=(1/4)(3/4)=3/16, i.e. (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4 of the maximum A. Hence the correct choice is “3/4, λ^(−6)”.
