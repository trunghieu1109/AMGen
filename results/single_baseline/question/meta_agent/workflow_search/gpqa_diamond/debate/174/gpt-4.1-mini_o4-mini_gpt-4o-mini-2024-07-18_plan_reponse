            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "The radiation from a symmetric spheroidal oscillation has no net dipole moment, so the leading term is quadrupole: dP/d\u03a9\u221d\u03c9\u2076\u2009sin\u00b2\u03b8\u2009cos\u00b2\u03b8\u221d\u03bb\u207b\u2076\u2009sin\u00b2\u03b8\u2009cos\u00b2\u03b8. This peaks at \u03b8=45\u00b0 (sin\u00b2\u03b8\u2009cos\u00b2\u03b8=1/4), and at \u03b8=30\u00b0 one gets sin\u00b230\u00b0\u2009cos\u00b230\u00b0=(1/4)(3/4)=3/16, i.e. (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4 of the maximum A. Hence the correct choice is \u201c3/4, \u03bb^(\u22126)\u201d.\n\nAnswer:B",
