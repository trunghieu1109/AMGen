            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "To determine the fraction of maximum power A radiated at an angle \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, we need to analyze the provided choices in relation to the angular distribution of radiated power. The function f describes how power varies with angle and wavelength. The angle \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 will determine which choice best represents the fraction of A radiated at that angle. The options provided give us various combinations of maximum power fractions and their respective wavelength dependencies. After evaluating the choices, the correct pairing that matches the expected behavior of an oscillating charge distribution in terms of radiation patterns is found in choice 3, which states '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)'. This indicates that at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, the fraction of maximum power A radiated is 1/4 and it varies with the wavelength as \\lambda^(-4).\n\nAnswer:1/4, \\lambda^(-4)",
