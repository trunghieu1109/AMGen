            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "All agents agree that the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(\u03b8), and at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, sin^2(30\u00b0) = 1/4. This means the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 is 1/4. Additionally, the power radiated by an oscillating charge is typically proportional to \u03bb^(-4), which is consistent with Rayleigh scattering and the Larmor formula for electric dipole radiation. Therefore, the fraction of A radiated at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 is 1/4, and the form of f is \u03bb^(-4).\n\nAnswer:C)",
