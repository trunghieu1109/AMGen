Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(θ), and at θ = 30°, sin^2(30°) = 1/4. This means the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4. Additionally, the power radiated by an oscillating charge is typically proportional to λ^(-4), which is consistent with Rayleigh scattering and the Larmor formula for electric dipole radiation. Therefore, the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and the form of f is λ^(-4).
