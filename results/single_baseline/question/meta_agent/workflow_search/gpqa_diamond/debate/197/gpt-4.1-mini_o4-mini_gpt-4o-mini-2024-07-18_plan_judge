Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Calculate the fraction α2 = β2[L]^2 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4) with [L]=0.1 M, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Numerator = 40×(0.1)^2 = 0.4. Denominator = 1 + 9×0.1 + 40×0.01 + 63×0.001 + 16×0.0001 = 2.3646. α2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 = 16.9%.
