    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent akgz:
We want the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. The fraction α2 = β2[SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). With [SCN-] = 0.1 M and β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16, compute terms: 1, 9*0.1 = 0.9, 40*(0.1)^2 = 0.4, 63*(0.1)^3 = 0.063, 16*(0.1)^4 = 0.0016. Sum = 2.3646. Then α2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 ≈ 16.9%.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2qyv:
Assuming free [SCN–] ≃0.1 M (Co is only 10–2 M), the fraction of Co(SCN)2 is β2[SCN–]^2/Σβn[SCN–]^n = 40·(0.1)^2/(1+9·0.1+40·0.01+63·0.001+16·0.0001) = 0.4/2.3646 ≃0.169 → 16.9%.

### thinking by Debate Agent jfnc:
The cumulative stability constants βn are given for Co2+ + nSCN– ⇌ Co(SCN)n^(2–n). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is α2 = β2[L]^2 / D, where D = 1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4. Substituting β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 and [SCN–]=0.1 M gives:
D = 1 + 9·0.1 + 40·(0.1)^2 + 63·(0.1)^3 + 16·(0.1)^4
  = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
β2[SCN–]^2 = 40·0.01 = 0.4
α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 = 16.9%

### thinking by Debate Agent yVr9:
We want the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all Co species. For metal–ligand equilibria, the mole fraction α2 = β2[L]^2 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4). Here [L] = 0.1 M, β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16. Compute terms:
β1[L] = 9·0.1 = 0.9
β2[L]^2 = 40·0.01 = 0.4
β3[L]^3 = 63·0.001 = 0.063
β4[L]^4 = 16·0.0001 = 0.0016
Denominator D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
Numerator = 0.4
So α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92% ≈ 16.9%.
