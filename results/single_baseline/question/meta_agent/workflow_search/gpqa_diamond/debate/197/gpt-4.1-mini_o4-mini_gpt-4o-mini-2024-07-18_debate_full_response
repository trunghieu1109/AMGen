The fraction α2 = β2[SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). With [SCN-] = 0.1 M and β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16, compute terms: 1, 9*0.1 = 0.9, 40*(0.1)^2 = 0.4, 63*(0.1)^3 = 0.063, 16*(0.1)^4 = 0.0016. Sum = 2.3646. Then α2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 ≈ 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2qyv:\nAssuming free [SCN–] ≃0.1 M (Co is only 10–2 M), the fraction of Co(SCN)2 is β2[SCN–]^2/Σβn[SCN–]^n = 40·(0.1)^2/(1+9·0.1+40·0.01+63·0.001+16·0.0001) = 0.4/2.3646 ≃0.169 → 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jfnc:\nThe cumulative stability constants βn are given for Co2+ + nSCN– ⇌ Co(SCN)n^(2–n). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is α2 = β2[L]^2 / D, where D = 1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4. Substituting β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 and [SCN–]=0.1 M gives:\nD = 1 + 9·0.1 + 40·(0.1)^2 + 63·(0.1)^3 + 16·(0.1)^4\n  = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nβ2[SCN–]^2 = 40·0.01 = 0.4\nα2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 = 16.9%\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent yVr9:\nWe want the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all Co species. For metal–ligand equilibria, the mole fraction α2 = β2[L]^2 / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]^2 + β3[L]^3 + β4[L]^4). Here [L] = 0.1 M, β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16. Compute terms:\nβ1[L] = 9·0.1 = 0.9\nβ2[L]^2 = 40·0.01 = 0.4\nβ3[L]^3 = 63·0.001 = 0.063\nβ4[L]^4 = 16·0.0001 = 0.0016\nDenominator D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nNumerator = 0.4\nSo α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92% ≈ 16.9%.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent akgz:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2qyv:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent jfnc:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yVr9:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
