Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 using the stability constant β2 and compare it to the total cobalt concentration. The stability constant β2 for Co(SCN)2 is 40. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We assume that the major species formed is Co(SCN)2 due to its high stability constant compared to others. With the given concentrations, [SCN-] = 0.1 M and c(Co) = 10^-2 M, we solve for [Co2+] using the mass balance equation and then calculate [Co(SCN)2]. Finally, the percentage is calculated as ([Co(SCN)2] / total Co concentration) * 100%. After considering the calculations and the stability constants, the answer that fits best is 25.6%.
