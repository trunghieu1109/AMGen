The relevant stability constants indicate how the cobalt ions will bind with thiocyanate ions to form complexes. We will use the given stability constants to find the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and then determine the total concentration of all cobalt species. The percentage can then be calculated using the formula: (concentration of blue complex / total concentration of cobalt species) * 100.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent r9FU:\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we first need to calculate the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants. The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to β2, which is 40. We will use the stability constants to find the concentrations of each complex formed. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and we need to find the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration. The calculations involve determining the concentrations of the various complexes formed (Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4) and then using these to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex. After performing the calculations, we will compare the result with the provided choices to find the correct percentage.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent JJWW:\nTo find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of the different cobalt complexes formed in the solution. The cobalt(II) ions can form complexes with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) according to the different stability constants provided. The formation of complexes can be represented as follows: Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]. The total concentration of cobalt is given as 10^-2 M, and the concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M. We will first calculate the concentrations of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex using the stability constant β2, and then determine the total concentration of cobalt species to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. We assume that the formation of higher-order complexes is negligible compared to the dithiocyanato complex due to the lower concentration of cobalt compared to thiocyanate. Using the stability constant β2, we can derive the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and then calculate the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species present in the solution.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mjlo:\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we need to calculate the concentrations of each cobalt species based on the given stability constants. We will use the stability constants to find the equilibrium concentrations of Co(SCN)2 and other complexes formed with thiocyanate. Then, we can calculate the total concentration of cobalt species and the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex. The relevant stability constant for the dithiocyanato complex is β2 = 40. We can set up the equations based on the formation of complexes and solve for the concentrations.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ncyV:\n42.3%\n\n### answer by Debate Agent r9FU:\n25.6%\n\n### answer by Debate Agent JJWW:\n42.3%\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mjlo:\n38.1%\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
