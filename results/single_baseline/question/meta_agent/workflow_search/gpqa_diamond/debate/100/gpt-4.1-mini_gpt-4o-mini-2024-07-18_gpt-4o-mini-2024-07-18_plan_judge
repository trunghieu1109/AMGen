Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine to yield 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, we analyze the final product. The presence of a cyclohexylidene group suggests that the reagent should be a carbonyl compound capable of forming an imine with the amine. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a suitable candidate for this, as it can provide the necessary carbonyl functionality. TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid that can effectively catalyze this type of reaction, promoting the formation of the imine. Therefore, the best choice is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH, which corresponds to choice 2.
