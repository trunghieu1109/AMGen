Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction involves forming an enamine (1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine) by condensing 3-methylpyrrolidine (a secondary amine) with an aldehyde under acid catalysis. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde provides the required cyclohexylidenemethyl group, whereas vinylcyclohexane cannot undergo condensation to give an enamine. p-Toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is a strong acid commonly used to catalyze enamine formation, while acetic acid is too weak. Thus, A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH (choice2), which corresponds to option B).
