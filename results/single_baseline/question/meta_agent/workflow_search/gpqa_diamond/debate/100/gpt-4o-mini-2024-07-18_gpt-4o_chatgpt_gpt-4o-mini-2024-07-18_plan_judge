Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction involves the formation of a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine ring, suggesting the involvement of a carbonyl compound that could form an enamine. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a suitable carbonyl compound for this reaction, as it can react with 3-methylpyrrolidine to form an enamine, which can then undergo dehydration to form the double bond in the final product. TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a suitable acid catalyst for such reactions, as it can facilitate the formation of the enamine by activating the carbonyl group. Therefore, the suitable reagent and catalyst are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and TsOH.
