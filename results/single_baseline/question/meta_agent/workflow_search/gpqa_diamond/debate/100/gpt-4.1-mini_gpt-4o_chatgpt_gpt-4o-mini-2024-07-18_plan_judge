Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction involves forming a double bond between the cyclohexyl group and the methyl group on the pyrrolidine, suggesting a condensation reaction. The product name '1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine' indicates a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine. This suggests that the starting material A should be a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which can form the cyclohexylidene group via a condensation reaction. The acid catalyst will facilitate the reaction, and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid commonly used in such reactions. Therefore, the suitable reagent and catalyst are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and TsOH.
