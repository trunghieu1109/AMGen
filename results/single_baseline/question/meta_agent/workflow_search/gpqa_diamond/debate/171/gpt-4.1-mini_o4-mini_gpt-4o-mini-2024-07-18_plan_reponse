            "Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?",

        "response": "In LTE, the excited\u2010level population follows Boltzmann\u2019s law: N* \u221d exp(\u2212\u0394E/(kT)). The ratio for the two stars is N1/N2 = exp[\u2212\u0394E/(kT1)]/exp[\u2212\u0394E/(kT2)] = exp[(\u0394E/k)(1/T2 \u2212 1/T1)] = 2. Taking the natural log gives ln\u20092 = (\u0394E/k)(1/T2 \u2212 1/T1) = (\u0394E/k)((T1 \u2212 T2)/(T1 T2)). Given \u0394E \u2248 k, this simplifies to ln\u20092 = (T1 \u2212 T2)/(T1 T2), which matches choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D",
