Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves the Boltzmann distribution and the relative population of energy levels in two stars under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann factor, and the condition that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 leads to the equation: exp(-ΔE/kT1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/kT2). Taking natural logarithms gives: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1). This can be rearranged to match the form of choice 4: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2). All agents agree that choice 4 is the correct representation of the derived equation.
