    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent BfXq:
We compare excitation in LTE: population in excited level ∝ exp(–ΔE/(kT)). The ratio of excited atoms in star1 to star2 is 2 = exp[–ΔE/(kT1)] / exp[–ΔE/(kT2)] = exp[ΔE/k*(1/T2 – 1/T1)]. Taking ln gives ln2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 – 1/T1) = (ΔE/k)((T1–T2)/(T1T2)). Omitting the common factor ΔE/k on both sides leads to ln2 = (T1 – T2)/(T1 T2), which matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent PYzm:
We have two stars in LTE. The ratio of populations in a particular excited level follows the Boltzmann factor: N_1/N_2 = exp[−E/(k T_1)+E/(k T_2)] = exp[(E/k)(1/T_2 −1/T_1)]. It is given that N_1/N_2=2, so ln2 = (E/k)(1/T_2 −1/T_1) = (E/k)[(T_1 −T_2)/(T_1 T_2)]. They give ΔE=1.38×10^(-23) J and k=1.38×10^(-23) J/K so E/k=1 K, so ln2 = (T_1 −T_2)/(T_1 T_2). That corresponds to choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent jCKO:
In LTE, the excited‐state population follows Boltzmann’s law: n₂/n₁ ∝ exp(−ΔE/kT). The ratio of excited atoms in star₁ to star₂ is 2, so:
exp[ΔE/k (1/T₂ − 1/T₁)] = 2
Taking ln gives ln 2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ − 1/T₁) = (ΔE/k)((T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂)). Dropping the constant factor (since all choices are dimensionless) the correct relation among T₁ and T₂ is ln 2 = (T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂).

### thinking by Debate Agent Kpai:
Under LTE, the ratio of excited‐level populations follows Boltzmann: N*(T1)/N*(T2)=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)] =2. Taking ln gives ln2 = (ΔE/k)((T1−T2)/(T1T2)). Given ΔE≈k, this reduces to ln2 = (T1−T2)/(T1T2).

    <pre>In LTE, the excited‐level population follows Boltzmann’s law: N* ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The ratio for the two stars is N1/N2 = exp[−ΔE/(kT1)]/exp[−ΔE/(kT2)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1)] = 2. Taking the natural log gives ln 2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1) = (ΔE/k)((T1 − T2)/(T1 T2)). Given ΔE ≈ k, this simplifies to ln 2 = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2), which matches choice 4.
