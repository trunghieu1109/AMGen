Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In LTE, the excited‐level population follows Boltzmann’s law: N* ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The ratio for the two stars is N1/N2 = exp[−ΔE/(kT1)]/exp[−ΔE/(kT2)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1)] = 2. Taking the natural log gives ln 2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1) = (ΔE/k)((T1 − T2)/(T1 T2)). Given ΔE ≈ k, this simplifies to ln 2 = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2), which matches choice 4.
