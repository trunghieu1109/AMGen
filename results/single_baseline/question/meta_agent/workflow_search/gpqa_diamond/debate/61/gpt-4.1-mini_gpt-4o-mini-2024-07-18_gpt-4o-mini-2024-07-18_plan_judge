Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to perform a series of transformations that introduce the necessary functional groups. The correct sequence of reagents should include steps for alkylation, reduction, ozonolysis, and hydrolysis. After analyzing the provided choices, choice 3 stands out as it includes NaNH2 for deprotonation, Li/liq. NH3 for reduction, O3 for ozonolysis, and NH4OH for hydrolysis, which aligns with the required transformations to achieve the desired product. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 3.
