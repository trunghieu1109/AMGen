Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane involves adding a methyl group, reducing the alkyne to an alkene, performing ozonolysis to introduce the aldehyde group, and finally forming the alcohol. Choice 1 correctly follows this sequence: 1) NaNH2, methyl chloride to add a methyl group; 2) H2/Pd-calcium carbonate for partial reduction to alkene; 3) O3/(CH3)2S for ozonolysis to form an aldehyde; 4) Ba(OH)2 for forming the alcohol group. Therefore, choice 1 is the correct sequence of reagents.
