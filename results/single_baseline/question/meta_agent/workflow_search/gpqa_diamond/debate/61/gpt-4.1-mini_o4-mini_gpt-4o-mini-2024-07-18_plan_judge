Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To install the necessary methyl substituent on the alkyne, we need NaNH2/MeCl (choice1 step1) to give cyclohexyl–C≡C–Me. Then partial hydrogenation with H2/Pd–CaCO3 yields the cis-alkene. Reductive ozonolysis (O3/(CH3)2S) cleaves the alkene into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Finally, Ba(OH)2 promotes a cross-aldol between the two carbonyls giving the β-hydroxy aldehyde. None of the other sequences build the required intermediates or use the correct reagents, so choice1 (A) is correct.
