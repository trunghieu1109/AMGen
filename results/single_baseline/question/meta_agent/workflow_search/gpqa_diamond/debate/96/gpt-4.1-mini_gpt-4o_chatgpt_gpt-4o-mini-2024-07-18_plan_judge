Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that Klinefelter's syndrome, which results from an extra X chromosome, has less prominent phenotypic consequences compared to Down's syndrome due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation. This process involves chromatin modifications, specifically methylation, which silences one of the X chromosomes. Therefore, the molecular mechanism responsible for the less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome is related to chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases.
