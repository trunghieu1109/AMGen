            "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?",

        "response": "Klinefelter's syndrome is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY), which often leads to milder symptoms compared to Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome can be attributed to mechanisms such as X-inactivation, which reduces the expression of genes on the extra X chromosome. Among the provided options, 'chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote' is the most relevant as it relates to gene expression regulation and chromatin structure, which can influence the phenotypic outcomes of the extra chromosome. This suggests that the extra X chromosome's effects can be mitigated through epigenetic modifications, leading to the milder phenotype observed in Klinefelter's syndrome compared to the more severe effects of Down's syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is related to chromatin methylation and its role in gene expression regulation.\n\nAnswer:C",
