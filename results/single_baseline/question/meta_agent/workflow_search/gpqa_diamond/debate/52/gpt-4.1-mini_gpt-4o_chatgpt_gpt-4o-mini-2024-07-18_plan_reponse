            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H, and two for \u2013CH3 groups, with no \u2013CH2 groups. The absence of -CH2 suggests that the compound has methyl groups instead of methylene groups. The presence of vinyl protons and the ester group suggests a structure with unsaturation and an ester linkage. Among the options, C12H14O2 fits the pattern of having enough hydrogens to account for the aromatic, vinyl, and methyl groups while maintaining the ester functional group. All agents agree that C12H14O2 is the correct formula based on the given spectral data.\n\nAnswer:A)",
