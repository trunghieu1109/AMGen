    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C12H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C12H12O2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;C11H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C11H12O2&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent QMOx:
The 1H NMR shows two aromatic signals but each integrates to 2H (para-disubstituted benzene gives 4 aromatic H in two sets), two vinyl signals (1H each), and two methyl signals (3H each). Total H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12. The ester contributes one OCH3 (3H), the vinyl substituent CH=CH–CH3 contributes 2H + 3H, and the ring accounts for 4H. Total C = 6 (ring) + 2 (CO2Me) + 3 (vinyl) = 11; H = 12; O = 2. Formula = C11H12O2, choice 4 (D).

### thinking by Debate Agent JOmF:
We have a di‐substituted benzene (C6H4) with two substituents: one is an ester (–COOCH3 gives C2H3O2) and the other is a vinyl methyl (–CH=CH–CH3 gives C3H5). Summing: C6H4 + C2H3O2 + C3H5 = C11H12O2. The NMR pattern (4 aromatic H as two sets of 2, a vinyl doublet and a doublet of quartets, plus two methyl singlets) matches –COOCH3 and –CH=CH–CH3 substituents. Thus the formula is C11H12O2, which is choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent hg4h:
First, the IR shows an ester (CO–O stretch), and the 1H NMR has six signals: 2 aromatic-H, 2 vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and 2 methyl groups – no CH2. A para-disubstituted benzene gives two aromatic signals (each 2H). The vinyl pattern (a doublet of quartets and a doublet) indicates CH=CH–CH3, and a methyl ester gives a singlet CH3. Total carbons: C6 (ring) + C3 (propenyl) + C1 (carbonyl) + C1 (ester CH3) = 11; hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (vinylic CH3) + 3 (ester CH3) = 12. So the formula is C11H12O2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3DCv:
The FTIR shows an ester; 1H NMR has 6 signals: two aromatic signals (para‐disubstituted benzene gives 4 H as 2 sets), two vinyl H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) and two methyl groups but no CH2. The vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) indicate a CH=CH–CH3 moiety. The ester has no CH2, so it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). Thus the molecule is methyl 4‐(1‐propenyl)benzoate: C6H4 ring + C3H5 propenyl + C2H3O2 ester = C11H12O2, which is choice D).
