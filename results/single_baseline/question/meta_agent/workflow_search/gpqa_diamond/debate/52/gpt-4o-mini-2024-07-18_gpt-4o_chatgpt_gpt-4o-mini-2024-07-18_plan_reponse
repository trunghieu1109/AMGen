            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "All agents agree that the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals for aromatic hydrogens, vinyl hydrogens, and methyl groups, with no methylene groups. The two aromatic hydrogens suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The vinyl hydrogens and methyl groups suggest additional substitution. The formula C12H14O2 accounts for the aromatic ring, ester group, vinyl group, and two methyl groups, fitting the NMR data and the absence of methylene groups. Therefore, the most likely chemical formula is C12H14O2.\n\nAnswer:A)",
