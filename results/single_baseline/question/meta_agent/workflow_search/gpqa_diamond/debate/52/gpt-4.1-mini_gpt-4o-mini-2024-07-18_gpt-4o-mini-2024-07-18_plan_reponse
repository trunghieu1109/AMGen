            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "To determine the correct chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the provided information. The presence of an ester group indicates that there are two oxygen atoms in the formula. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals, which suggests a total of six unique hydrogen environments. The signals indicate two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl (\u2013CH3) groups, with no methylene (\u2013CH2) groups present. This suggests a structure that is likely less saturated, possibly indicating fewer hydrogen atoms. The total number of carbons and hydrogens needs to be balanced with the presence of the ester group. The choices given are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. Since there are six signals, the compound is likely to have a higher number of carbons and hydrogens, leaning towards the C12 options. The absence of \u2013CH2 groups also suggests a more branched or substituted structure, making C12H14O2 a likely candidate as it aligns with the expected saturation and the number of signals observed in the NMR spectrum. Therefore, the most fitting chemical formula is C12H14O2.\n\nAnswer:C12H14O2",
