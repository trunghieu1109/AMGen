            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "The IR indicates an ester; the 1H NMR shows two aromatic signals integrating to 4 H (para-disubstituted benzene), two vinyl H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets for CH=CH\u2013CH3), and two methyl singlets (\u2013OCH3 and \u2013CH3) with no CH2 signals. Total H=12 and total C=11 when adding C6 (ring) + C3 (propenyl) + C2 (COOCH3). Thus the formula is C11H12O2, corresponding to choice D.\n\nAnswer:D)",
