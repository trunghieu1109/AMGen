Total H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12. The ester contributes one OCH3 (3H), the vinyl substituent CH=CH–CH3 contributes 2H + 3H, and the ring accounts for 4H. Total C = 6 (ring) + 2 (CO2Me) + 3 (vinyl) = 11; H = 12; O = 2. Formula = C11H12O2, choice 4 (D).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent JOmF:\nWe have a di‐substituted benzene (C6H4) with two substituents: one is an ester (–COOCH3 gives C2H3O2) and the other is a vinyl methyl (–CH=CH–CH3 gives C3H5). Summing: C6H4 + C2H3O2 + C3H5 = C11H12O2. The NMR pattern (4 aromatic H as two sets of 2, a vinyl doublet and a doublet of quartets, plus two methyl singlets) matches –COOCH3 and –CH=CH–CH3 substituents. Thus the formula is C11H12O2, which is choice D.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent hg4h:\nFirst, the IR shows an ester (CO–O stretch), and the 1H NMR has six signals: 2 aromatic-H, 2 vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and 2 methyl groups – no CH2. A para-disubstituted benzene gives two aromatic signals (each 2H). The vinyl pattern (a doublet of quartets and a doublet) indicates CH=CH–CH3, and a methyl ester gives a singlet CH3. Total carbons: C6 (ring) + C3 (propenyl) + C1 (carbonyl) + C1 (ester CH3) = 11; hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (vinylic CH3) + 3 (ester CH3) = 12. So the formula is C11H12O2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 3DCv:\nThe FTIR shows an ester; 1H NMR has 6 signals: two aromatic signals (para‐disubstituted benzene gives 4 H as 2 sets), two vinyl H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) and two methyl groups but no CH2. The vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) indicate a CH=CH–CH3 moiety. The ester has no CH2, so it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). Thus the molecule is methyl 4‐(1‐propenyl)benzoate: C6H4 ring + C3H5 propenyl + C2H3O2 ester = C11H12O2, which is choice D).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent QMOx:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent JOmF:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent hg4h:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3DCv:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
