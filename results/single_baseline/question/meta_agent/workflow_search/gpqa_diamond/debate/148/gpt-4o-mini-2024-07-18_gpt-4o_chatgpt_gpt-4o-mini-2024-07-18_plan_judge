Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the presence of two peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks in the LC-MS analysis, both with equal intensities and the same mass spectrum, suggests the presence of two distinct species with the same molecular weight. Enantiomers would not show separate peaks in NMR or LC-MS under normal conditions because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Diastereoisomers, however, can have different chemical shifts and separate peaks in NMR and LC-MS because they have different physical properties. The equal intensity of the peaks supports the presence of diastereoisomers, as they are present in equal amounts. Spin-spin coupling and contamination by a precursor are ruled out by the given information. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
