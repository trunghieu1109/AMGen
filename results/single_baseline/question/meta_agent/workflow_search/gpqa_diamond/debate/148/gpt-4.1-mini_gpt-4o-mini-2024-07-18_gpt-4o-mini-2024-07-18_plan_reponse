            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The observations from the NMR spectrum and LC-MS analysis indicate that the compound displays two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which cannot be explained by spin-spin coupling. The equal intensities and mass spectra suggest that these peaks arise from two distinct forms of the compound. Given that the peaks correspond to the same proton and the analysis rules out coupling as a cause, the most plausible explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers can have different physical properties, including chemical shifts in NMR, leading to the observed peaks. This reasoning is consistent across multiple analyses.\n\nAnswer:B",
