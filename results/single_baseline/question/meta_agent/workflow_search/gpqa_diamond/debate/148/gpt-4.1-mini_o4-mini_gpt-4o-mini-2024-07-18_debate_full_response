This indicates two interconverting species of the same compound, not different masses (ruling out contamination), not enantiomers (which give identical NMR in achiral solvents), and not a byproduct of coupling. The likely cause is restricted rotation around the amide bond, giving rise to two rotamers (cis/trans) that are diastereomeric in the presence of other chiral centers. Hence the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Jzdx:\nThe duplicate alpha-proton peaks integrating to 1\u2009H total and ruling out coupling suggest two species with the same mass and connectivity. LC-MS shows two equal peaks with identical spectra, so it’s not contamination or different MW. Enantiomers give identical NMR, so that’s out. A ‘double coupling’ artifact isn’t plausible here. The likely cause is racemization at the α-carbon during amide bond formation, yielding a pair of diastereomers that don’t interconvert at room/elevated temperature and give separate NMR/LC peaks.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YU81:\nThe duplicate alpha‐proton peaks with no other spectral duplications, combined with two LC peaks of identical mass and intensity, point to two slowly interconverting conformers (cis/trans amide rotamers). These are not enantiomers, and only the local amide environment (the α‐proton) is affected rather than the entire molecule as would be the case with true diastereomers. Therefore the best match among the choices is a mixture of diastereoisomeric rotamers.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent EXWz:\nThe observation of two peaks for the same α‐proton with equal integrals that sum to 1H, together with two LC peaks of identical mass spectra, suggests the presence of two isomeric forms that interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale but have the same mass. Enantiomers give identical NMR in an achiral environment and usually don’t separate on typical LC, while contamination would show differing masses or extra signals. ‘Double coupling’ is ruled out by the coupling pattern. Peptidic amide bonds can undergo partial epimerization at the α‐carbon during coupling, yielding a pair of diastereoisomers that differ only at that center. These diastereoisomers have slightly different chemical shifts (splitting the α‐proton resonance) and can be separated by LC, but share the same mass spectrum.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Uusi:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Jzdx:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YU81:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent EXWz:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
