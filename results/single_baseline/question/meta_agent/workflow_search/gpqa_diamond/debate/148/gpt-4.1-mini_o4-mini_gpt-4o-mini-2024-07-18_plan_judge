Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The duplicate α‐proton signals that integrate to 1 H total, combined with two LC peaks of identical mass spectra, indicate two isomeric forms of the same molecule rather than a contaminant or different mass species. Enantiomers would give identical NMR in an achiral solvent and wouldn’t separate on typical LC, and spin–spin coupling is ruled out. The most plausible explanation is epimerization at the α‐carbon during amide coupling, producing a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers that have slightly different chemical shifts and separate by LC.
