Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The observations from the 1H NMR spectrum and LC-MS analysis suggest the presence of two forms of the compound that are chemically identical but differ in some structural aspect. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, indicate that these forms are not due to spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum further supports the idea that the two forms are chemically identical. Enantiomers would not show separate peaks in NMR or LC-MS under normal conditions, as they are mirror images and have the same chemical environment. Diastereoisomers, however, can have different chemical environments, leading to different NMR peaks and possibly different retention times in LC-MS. 'Double coupling' or contamination would likely result in different mass spectra or additional peaks, not two identical ones. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
