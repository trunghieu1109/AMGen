Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the relative speed and total energy, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula and the relativistic energy formula. The relative speed is calculated using v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2), which gives v_rel = 0.14c. The total energy is calculated using E = γ1*m1*c^2 + γ2*m2*c^2, where γ1 and γ2 are the Lorentz factors for each astronaut. After calculating, the total energy is found to be approximately 5.96 mc^2. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
