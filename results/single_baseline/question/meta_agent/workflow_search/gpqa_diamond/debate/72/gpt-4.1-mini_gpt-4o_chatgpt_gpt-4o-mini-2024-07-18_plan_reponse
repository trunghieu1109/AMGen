            "Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?",

        "correct_answer": 1,
        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "To determine the relative speed and total energy, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula and the relativistic energy formula. The relative speed is calculated using v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2), which gives v_rel = 0.14c. The total energy is calculated using E = \u03b31*m1*c^2 + \u03b32*m2*c^2, where \u03b31 and \u03b32 are the Lorentz factors for each astronaut. After calculating, the total energy is found to be approximately 5.96 mc^2. Therefore, the correct choice is A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
