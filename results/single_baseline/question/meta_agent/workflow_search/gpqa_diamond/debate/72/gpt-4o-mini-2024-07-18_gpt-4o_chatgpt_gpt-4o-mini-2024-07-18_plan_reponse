        "response": "All agents agree on the method to calculate the relative speed using the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2). Substituting v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c, we get v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.14c. For the total energy, they use the relativistic energy formula: E = \u03b31*m1*c^2 + \u03b32*m2*c^2, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2). Calculating \u03b31 = 1.25 and \u03b32 = 1.1547, the total energy is E = 5.96 mc^2. All agents conclude that the correct choice is A) v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5.96 mc^2.\n\nAnswer:A)",
