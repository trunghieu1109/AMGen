Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the method to calculate the relative speed using the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2). Substituting v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c, we get v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.14c. For the total energy, they use the relativistic energy formula: E = γ1*m1*c^2 + γ2*m2*c^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2). Calculating γ1 = 1.25 and γ2 = 1.1547, the total energy is E = 5.96 mc^2. All agents conclude that the correct choice is A) v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5.96 mc^2.
