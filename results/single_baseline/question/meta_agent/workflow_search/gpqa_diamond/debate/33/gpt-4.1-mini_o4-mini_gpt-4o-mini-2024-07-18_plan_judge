Question: Example(question='"1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.\nFor the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?\n3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A\n3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B\n1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C', choice1='A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one', choice2='A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one', choice3='A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one', choice4='A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In each diol, protonation and water loss gives a stabilized carbocation (benzylic or diaryl). The group with highest migratory aptitude (aryl > alkyl > methyl) shifts, and the remaining OH forms the ketone. Applying this: A gives 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B gives 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, and C gives 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one, matching choice 3.
