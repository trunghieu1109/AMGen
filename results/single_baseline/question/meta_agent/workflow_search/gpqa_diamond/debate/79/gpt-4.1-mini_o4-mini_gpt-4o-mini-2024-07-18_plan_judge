Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We only have two equations for four unknown nucleotide‐weights, so many integer assignments satisfy AGG →115 and TGCTGA →176.  To break ties most simply, assign the smallest positive integer to T (w_T=1), then solve: w_A+2w_G=115 gives one choice w_A=11, w_G=52; then 2w_T+2w_G+w_C+w_A=176 ⇒ w_C=59.  Summing for ACAGTGACC (3A,3C,2G,1T): 3·11+3·59+2·52+1·1=315.  Thus the most straightforward mapping yields B).
