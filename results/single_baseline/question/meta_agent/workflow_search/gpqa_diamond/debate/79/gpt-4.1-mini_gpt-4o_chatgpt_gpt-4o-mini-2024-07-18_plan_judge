Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The task is to determine the numerical output for the sequence ACAGTGACC based on the given examples AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. The challenge is to identify the pattern or algorithm that converts these nucleotide sequences into numbers. The agents have proposed various hypotheses, such as assigning specific values to each nucleotide and summing them up, or considering a more complex encoding pattern. However, none of the proposed methods perfectly fit the given examples. Agent dxpu suggests a specific assignment of values (A=1, G=57, T=20, C=21) that results in a calculated value of 200 for ACAGTGACC, but this does not match any of the provided choices. Agent TujJ and EHft suggest that the answer is C) 351, while xzDA suggests B) 315. Given the complexity and lack of a clear pattern, the choice that seems to fit the expected complexity pattern is C) 351, as suggested by multiple agents.
