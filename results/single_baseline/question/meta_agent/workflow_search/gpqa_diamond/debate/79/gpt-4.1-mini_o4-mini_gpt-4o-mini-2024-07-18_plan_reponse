To break ties most simply, assign the smallest positive integer to T (w_T=1), then solve: w_A+2w_G=115 gives one choice w_A=11, w_G=52; then 2w_T+2w_G+w_C+w_A=176 \u21d2 w_C=59.  Summing for ACAGTGACC (3A,3C,2G,1T): 3\u00b711+3\u00b759+2\u00b752+1\u00b71=315.  Thus the most straightforward mapping yields B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
