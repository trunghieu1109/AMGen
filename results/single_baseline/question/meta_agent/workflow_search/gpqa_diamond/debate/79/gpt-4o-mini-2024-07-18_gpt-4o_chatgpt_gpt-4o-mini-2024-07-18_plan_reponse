        "response": "The problem involves determining the pattern or rule that converts DNA sequences into numerical values. The given examples AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176 do not provide enough information to deduce a clear pattern, as simple summation or position-based values do not match the outputs. The sequence ACAGTGACC is longer, suggesting a larger output. All agents have considered various approaches, including assigning arbitrary values or considering molecular weights, but none match the given outputs. Given the options and the lack of a clear pattern, the choice C) 351 is selected as it is the largest number and aligns with the increasing sequence length, which is a common pattern in such problems.\n\nAnswer:C",
