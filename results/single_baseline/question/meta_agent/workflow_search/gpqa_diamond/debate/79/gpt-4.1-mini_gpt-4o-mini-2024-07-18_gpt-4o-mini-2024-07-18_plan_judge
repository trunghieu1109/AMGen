Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the output for the input 'ACAGTGACC', we need to analyze the patterns from the previous examples. The outputs for 'AGG' and 'TGCTGA' suggest a relationship that may involve the characters' positions or some transformation. After evaluating the potential transformations and testing the options provided, it appears that the output for 'ACAGTGACC' corresponds to 333 based on the derived logic from the previous examples.
