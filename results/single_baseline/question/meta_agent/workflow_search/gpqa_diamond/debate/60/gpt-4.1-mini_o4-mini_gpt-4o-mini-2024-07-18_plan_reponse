        "response": "1. Benzene \u2192 nitrobenzene via HNO3/H2SO4. 2. Nitro is meta\u2010directing so Br2/Fe gives 3\u2010bromonitrobenzene. 3. H2/Pd\u2010C reduces \u2013NO2 to \u2013NH2 yielding 3\u2010bromoaniline. 4. NaNO2/HBF4 diazotizes the amine to a diazonium salt. 5. Heating induces Gomberg\u2013Bachmann coupling with anisole at its para position (directed by \u2013OMe), forming a biphenyl with Br at C3 of ring 1 and OMe at C4\u2032 of ring 2, i.e. 3\u2010bromo\u20104\u2032\u2010methoxy\u20101,1\u2032\u2010biphenyl.\n\nAnswer:B)",
