Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operators P and Q. The operator P has an eigenvalue 0 with a corresponding eigenvector. The initial state vector is projected onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. After measuring P, the state collapses to this eigenvector. We then measure Q and project the collapsed state onto the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q. The total probability is the product of these probabilities. After reviewing the calculations, the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.
