            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

        "response": "To determine the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operators P and Q. For P, the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1). We project the initial state (-1, 2, 1) onto this eigenvector to find the probability amplitude, which gives us the probability of measuring 0 for P. After measuring P, the state collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0. For Q, the eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector (0, 0, 1). We project the collapsed state onto this eigenvector to find the probability amplitude, which gives us the probability of measuring -1 for Q. The joint probability is the product of these two probabilities. After calculations, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\nAnswer:B)",
