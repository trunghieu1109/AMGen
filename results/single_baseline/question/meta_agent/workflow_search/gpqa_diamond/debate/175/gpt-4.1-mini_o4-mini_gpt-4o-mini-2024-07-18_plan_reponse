            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

Operator P has eigenvalue 0 with eigenvector proportional to (1,0,\u20131), normalized to |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (1,0,\u20131). The probability of measuring P=0 is |\u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 = (1/3). After collapse to |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9, operator Q has eigenvalue \u20131 with eigenvector (0,0,1); the probability of Q=\u20131 is |\u27e8(0,0,1)|\u03c6\u2080\u27e9|\u00b2 = 1/2. The joint probability is (1/3)(1/2) = 1/6.\n\nAnswer:B)",
