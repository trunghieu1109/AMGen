Its norm² = 6, so |ψ⟩ = (−1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). Operator P has eigenvalues +1,0,−1. The eigenvector for P=0 satisfies P|φ₀⟩=0, giving |φ₀⟩ ∝ (1,0,−1) ⇒ normalized to (1/√2,0,−1/√2). Probability to measure P=0 is |⟨φ₀|ψ⟩|² = |(1/√2)(−1/√6)+(−1/√2)(1/√6)|² = (−1/√3)² = 1/3. After collapse to |φ₀⟩, measuring Q (diagonal 1,0,−1) gives −1 with probability |⟨3|φ₀⟩|² = |−1/√2|² = 1/2. Joint probability = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent rEy9:\nWe have initial (unnormalized) state ψ=(-1,2,1). Normalize: ‖ψ‖=√6, so ψₙ=ψ/√6. Operator P has eigenvalue 0 eigenvector φ₀∝(1,0,−1), normalized φ₀=(1/√2)(1,0,−1). Probability P=0 = |⟨φ₀|ψₙ⟩|² = |(1/√2)(−1−1)/√6|² = (2/√(2·6))² =1/3. Post-measurement state is φ₀. Operator Q has eigenvalue −1 eigenvector e₃=(0,0,1), so conditional P(Q=−1|P=0)=|⟨e₃|φ₀⟩|² = (1/√2)²=1/2. Total probability = (1/3)(1/2)=1/6.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent o0Y6:\n1. The initial state |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1)ᵀ is normalized by √6.\n2. Operator P has eigenvalue 0 with normalized eigenvector |φ₀⟩ = (1,0,−1)/√2.\n3. Probability of measuring P=0 is |⟨φ₀|ψ⟩|² = (1/3).\n4. After P=0, the state collapses to |φ₀⟩.\n5. Operator Q has eigenvalue −1 with eigenvector (0,0,1). The probability of measuring Q=−1 from |φ₀⟩ is |−1/√2|² = 1/2.\n6. Joint probability = (1/3)·(1/2) = 1/6.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent QE6c:\nFirst, normalize the state |ψ> = (-1,2,1): Norm^2 = 6, so |ψ'>=(1/√6)(-1,2,1). The operator P has eigenvalues 0, ±1. For eigenvalue 0, solve P|u0>=0 ⇒ |u0>∝(1,0,-1), normalized to (1/√2)(1,0,-1). The probability of measuring P=0 is |<u0|ψ'>|^2 = |(1/√2,0,-1/√2)·(-1/√6,2/√6,1/√6)|^2 = |-2/(2√3)|^2 = 1/3. After collapse to |u0>, measure Q whose eigenvector for -1 is |e3>=(0,0,1). The probability of Q=-1 is |<e3|u0>|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. The joint probability = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yZvX:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent rEy9:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent o0Y6:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent QE6c:\nB\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
