            "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n",

        "response": "Number the ring so that the carboxyl is C-1. The other substituents then occupy C-2 (OH), C-3 (CN), C-4 (OMe), C-5 (CHO) and C-6 (NMe\u2082). Both this and the alternative numbering (CN at C-5) satisfy the positional constraints, but by the lowest-number (cyano) rule the CN must be at C-3 rather than C-5. Listing substituents alphabetically (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) gives the IUPAC name in choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
