            "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n",

        "response": "All agents agree that the carboxylic acid group is the principal functional group and should be assigned position 1. The description specifies that the cyano, carbaldehyde, and carboxylic acid groups are meta to each other, placing them at positions 1, 3, and 5. The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions 2 and 6. The methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4. The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the nitrile, confirming the nitrile at position 5. This matches the description in choice 1, which is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nAnswer:A)",
