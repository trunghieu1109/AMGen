    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Assign carboxylic acid as position 1 (highest priority). Ortho to it are OH and NMe2 (positions 2 and 6), para is OMe (position 4). The three meta-related groups (COOH, CHO, CN) must occupy 1,3,5. The methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile, so nitrile is at 3 (neighbors at 2=OH and 4=OMe). Thus substituents: 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OMe, 5-CHO, 6-NMe2. Numbering must give lowest locant to the first substituent in alphabetical order (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy), so cyano gets 3 not 5. The correct IUPAC name matches choice2.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
Number the ring with the carboxylic acid as C-1. Ortho to it are C-2 and C-6: the hydroxyl must be at C-2 because the methoxy at C-4 and hydroxyl both ortho to the nitrile place the nitrile at C-3. The remaining substituent, the formyl, is at C-5, and the dimethylamino at C-6. Substituents are then 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid, matching choice 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
We assign the carboxylic acid as position 1. Ortho (2,6) must be hydroxy and dimethylamino; para (4) is methoxy; the three meta positions (3,5) are cyano and formyl so that all three (COOH, cyano, formyl) are mutual meta. The requirement “methoxy and alcohol both ortho to the nitrile” places cyano at 3, giving OH at 2 and OMe at 4. Numbering clockwise from COOH (1) through OH (2), CN (3), OMe (4), CHO (5), NMe₂ (6) then listing substituents alphabetically yields 3‐cyano‐6‐(dimethylamino)‐5‐formyl‐2‐hydroxy‐4‐methoxybenzoic acid, which is choice 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:
We assign the carboxylic acid at ring position 1. Ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) are the dimethylamino and hydroxy; para (position 4) is methoxy. The cyano, carbaldehyde, and carboxyl are mutually meta, so the formyl and cyano must occupy positions 3 and 5. The requirement that both the methoxy and alcohol are ortho to the nitrile (at 5) fixes methoxy at 4 and hydroxy at 6, leaving dimethylamino at 2 and formyl at 3. Thus the substituents are at 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy. Per IUPAC alphabetical order (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) the correct name is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, choice A.

    <pre>Number the ring so that the carboxyl is C-1. The other substituents then occupy C-2 (OH), C-3 (CN), C-4 (OMe), C-5 (CHO) and C-6 (NMe₂). Both this and the alternative numbering (CN at C-5) satisfy the positional constraints, but by the lowest-number (cyano) rule the CN must be at C-3 rather than C-5. Listing substituents alphabetically (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) gives the IUPAC name in choice 2.
