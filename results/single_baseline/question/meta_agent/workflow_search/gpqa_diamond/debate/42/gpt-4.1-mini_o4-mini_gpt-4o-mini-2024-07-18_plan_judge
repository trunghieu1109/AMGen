Question: Example(question='A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', choice1='5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice2='3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice3='2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', choice4='2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Number the ring so that the carboxyl is C-1. The other substituents then occupy C-2 (OH), C-3 (CN), C-4 (OMe), C-5 (CHO) and C-6 (NMeâ‚‚). Both this and the alternative numbering (CN at C-5) satisfy the positional constraints, but by the lowest-number (cyano) rule the CN must be at C-3 rather than C-5. Listing substituents alphabetically (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) gives the IUPAC name in choice 2.
