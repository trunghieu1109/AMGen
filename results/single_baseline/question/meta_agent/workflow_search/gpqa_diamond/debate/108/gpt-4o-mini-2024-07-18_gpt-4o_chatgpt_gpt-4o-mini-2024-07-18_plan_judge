Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition. The initial state is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0, and the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1. The final NN state must have T(NN) = 0, and the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) must be satisfied. Let's analyze each choice:

1. 1S0 -> 3P0 + s: S=1, L=1, J=0, l=0. Parity: (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 * (-1) = +1. T = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (mod 2) = 1, which does not match T(NN)=0.

2. 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: S=3, L=2, J=1, l=1. Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 * (-1) = -1. T = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

3. 1S0 -> 3D3 + f: S=1, L=2, J=3, l=3. Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 * (-1) = +1. T = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

4. 1S0 -> 3S1 + p: S=1, L=0, J=1, l=1. Parity: (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 * (-1) = +1. T = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

Choice 1 does not satisfy the Pauli statistics condition, as T(NN) does not match. Therefore, choice 1 is not permitted.
