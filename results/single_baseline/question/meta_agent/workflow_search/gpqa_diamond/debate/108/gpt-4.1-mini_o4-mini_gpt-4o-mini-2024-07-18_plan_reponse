            "Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.",

        "response": "Initial NN: 1S0 (J=0, L=0, S=0, parity +1). Emitted X: intrinsic parity \u20131, orbital \u2113. Conservation of J (0\u2192J_NN\u2295\u2113) \u21d2 J_NN=\u2113. Parity: (+1)=[(\u20131)^{L_NN}][\u20131\u00b7(\u20131)^\u2113] \u21d2 L_NN+\u2113 odd. Pauli for T=0: S_NN+L_NN odd. Check each choice: only 3P0+s has S+L=1+1=2 (even), violating the Pauli condition. All others satisfy S+L odd and L+\u2113 odd and J_NN=\u2113. Thus 1S0\u21923P0+s is forbidden.\n\nAnswer:A)",
