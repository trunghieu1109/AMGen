### thinking by Debate Agent SQ6z:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity. The initial state is a 1S0 state, which means S=0, L=0, and J=0. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1. For the final NN state with T(NN) = 0, the Pauli statistics condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) must be satisfied. Let&#39;s analyze each choice:

1. 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: Here, the final NN state is 3P0, which means S=1, L=1, J=0. The emitted particle X is in the s state (l=0). Parity: (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l * (-1) (intrinsic parity) = (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 * (-1) = +1.

2. 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: Here, the final NN state is 7D1, which means S=3, L=2, J=1. The emitted particle X is in the p state (l=1). Parity: (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 * (-1) = -1.

3. 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: Here, the final NN state is 3D3, which means S=1, L=2, J=3. The emitted particle X is in the f state (l=3). Parity: (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 * (-1) = +1.

4. 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: Here, the final NN state is 3S1, which means S=1, L=0, J=1. The emitted particle X is in the p state (l=1). Parity: (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 * (-1) = +1.

According to the parity conservation, the initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1. Therefore, the final parity must also be +1. Choice 2 results in a final parity of -1, which does not match the initial parity. Thus, this partial wave is not permitted.

### thinking by Debate Agent rebD:
To solve this, we need to consider both the conservation of parity and the isospin, spin, and angular momentum quantum numbers. The initial state is 1S0, meaning total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The intrinsic parity of the particle X is -1. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. For the final NN state, T(NN) = 0, so S(NN) + L(NN) must be even. Let&#39;s analyze each choice:

1. 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 1 (P wave), hence S + L = 2 (even), parity = (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 = -1, which matches initial parity.

2. 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 3, L(NN) = 2 (D wave), hence S + L = 5 (odd), parity = (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = 1, which does not match initial parity.

3. 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 2 (D wave), hence S + L = 3 (odd), parity = (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 = 1, which does not match initial parity.

4. 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 0 (S wave), hence S + L = 1 (odd), parity = (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = -1, which matches initial parity.

Choices 2 and 3 do not satisfy the parity condition, but only one choice is not permitted. Both 2 and 3 have odd S + L, but choice 3 also has incorrect parity. Thus, choice 3 is not permitted.

### thinking by Debate Agent UTaM:
First, we need to analyze the initial and final states of the nucleons and the emitted particle X. The initial state is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0, and T(NN)=0. For the final state, we must conserve total angular momentum (J) and parity. The conservation of angular momentum requires that the sum of the angular momentum of the nucleons and the particle X equals the initial J (which is 0). The parity of the system is given by (-1)^(L(NN) + l(X)), where l(X) is the orbital angular momentum of X, and the intrinsic parity of X is -1. We also have the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

Let&#39;s analyze each choice:

1. 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: Here, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, J(NN)=0, l(X)=0, so the parity is (-1)^(1+0) * (-1) = +1, which is different from the initial state parity (-1)^0 = +1. Also, T(NN)=0, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, so T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (mod 2) = 1, which doesn&#39;t match T(NN)=0.

2. 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: Here, S(NN)=3, L(NN)=2, J(NN)=1, l(X)=1, so the parity is (-1)^(2+1) * (-1) = +1, which is incorrect. Also, T(NN)=0, S(NN)=3, L(NN)=2, so T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

3. 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: Here, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, J(NN)=3, l(X)=3, so the parity is (-1)^(2+3) * (-1) = +1, which is incorrect. Also, T(NN)=0, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, so T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

4. 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: Here, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=0, J(NN)=1, l(X)=1, so the parity is (-1)^(0+1) * (-1) = +1, which is incorrect. Also, T(NN)=0, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=0, so T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

The only choice that fails both parity conservation and the T(NN) condition is choice 1.

### thinking by Debate Agent Z1Vz:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the conditions given by Pauli statistics. The initial state is a 1S0 state, which means S=0, L=0, and J=0. The isospin T(NN) is given as 0 for the final state. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

1. For choice 1: 3P0 + s
   - 3P0 indicates S=1, L=1, J=0.
   - The intrinsic parity of X is -1, and the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L = -1.
   - Total parity is (-1)^1 * (-1) = +1.
   - T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 1, so S + L + 1 = 3, which is odd, matching T(NN) = 0.

2. For choice 2: 7D1 + p
   - 7D1 indicates S=3, L=2, J=1.
   - The parity of the NN state is (-1)^2 = +1.
   - Total parity is (+1) * (-1) = -1.
   - T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 3, L(NN) = 2, so S + L + 1 = 6, which is even, not matching T(NN) = 0.

3. For choice 3: 3D3 + f
   - 3D3 indicates S=1, L=2, J=3.
   - The parity of the NN state is (-1)^2 = +1.
   - Total parity is (+1) * (-1) = -1.
   - T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 2, so S + L + 1 = 4, which is even, not matching T(NN) = 0.

4. For choice 4: 3S1 + p
   - 3S1 indicates S=1, L=0, J=1.
   - The parity of the NN state is (-1)^0 = +1.
   - Total parity is (+1) * (-1) = -1.
   - T(NN) = 0, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 0, so S + L + 1 = 2, which is even, not matching T(NN) = 0.

Choices 2, 3, and 4 do not satisfy the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). However, choice 1 satisfies all conservation laws and conditions, so it is permitted. Thus, the partial waves in choices 2, 3, and 4 are not permitted, but since we need to select the one that is not permitted from the given choices, we focus on the one that violates the parity or the Pauli statistics condition the most clearly, which is choice 2.

    <pre>To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition. The initial state is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0, and the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1. The final NN state must have T(NN) = 0, and the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) must be satisfied. Let&#39;s analyze each choice:

1. 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: S=1, L=1, J=0, l=0. Parity: (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 * (-1) = +1. T = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (mod 2) = 1, which does not match T(NN)=0.

2. 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: S=3, L=2, J=1, l=1. Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 * (-1) = -1. T = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

3. 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: S=1, L=2, J=3, l=3. Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 * (-1) = +1. T = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

4. 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: S=1, L=0, J=1, l=1. Parity: (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 * (-1) = +1. T = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (mod 2) = 0, which matches T(NN)=0.

Choice 1 does not satisfy the Pauli statistics condition, as T(NN) does not match. Therefore, choice 1 is not permitted.
