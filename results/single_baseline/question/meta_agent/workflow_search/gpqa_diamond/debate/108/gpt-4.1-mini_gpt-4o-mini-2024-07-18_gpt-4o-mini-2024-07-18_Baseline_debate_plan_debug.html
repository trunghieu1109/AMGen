    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent ebDU:
To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) with T(NN) = 0. We will analyze each choice based on the allowed combinations of spin, angular momentum, and parity. The parity of the final state can be determined from the initial state and the emitted particle&#39;s parity. The parity of the initial state is +1, and since particle X has parity -1, the final state must have an overall parity of +1 (to conserve parity). We will check each option for consistency with these rules.

### thinking by Debate Agent TaMZ:
To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to analyze the conservation of angular momentum and parity in the transition from the initial state 1S0 to the final NN state. The initial state 1S0 has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, which means we need to ensure that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) is satisfied. We will evaluate each choice based on the final angular momentum states and their corresponding parities.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1VzR:
To determine which partial wave transition is not permitted, we need to analyze each option based on the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle regarding isospin. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, we require S(NN) + L(NN) to be odd. We will evaluate each choice accordingly.

### thinking by Debate Agent Rdcv:
To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to analyze the conservation of isospin, angular momentum, and parity. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1, which will affect the parity of the final state. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since the initial state has T(NN) = 0, the final state must have T(NN) = 0, which means S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. We will analyze each choice for the values of S, L, and J to see if they satisfy the conditions.

### answer by Debate Agent ebDU:
1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f

### answer by Debate Agent TaMZ:
1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f

### answer by Debate Agent 1VzR:
The choice that is not permitted is: choice3: &#39;1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f&#39;.

### answer by Debate Agent Rdcv:

    <pre>To determine which partial wave transition is not permitted, we analyze the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle regarding isospin.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1, affecting the parity of the final state. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, the final state must also have T(NN) = 0, meaning S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. Evaluating each choice, we find that the combination 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f does not satisfy the required conditions, as it leads to an even total for S(NN) + L(NN). Therefore, this transition is not permitted.
