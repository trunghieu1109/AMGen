            "Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.",

        "response": "To determine which partial wave transition is not permitted, we analyze the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle regarding isospin. The initial state is 1S0, which has total spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1, affecting the parity of the final state. The final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, the final state must also have T(NN) = 0, meaning S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. Evaluating each choice, we find that the combination 1S0 -> 3D3 + f does not satisfy the required conditions, as it leads to an even total for S(NN) + L(NN). Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\nAnswer:choice3",
