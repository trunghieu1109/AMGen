### thinking by Debate Agent SQ6z:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation laws for angular momentum and parity, as well as the requirement from Pauli statistics. The initial state of the NN system is given as 1S0, which means S=0, L=0, and J=0. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1. For the final NN state, T(NN)=0. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). We need to check each option to see if it satisfies these conditions.

1. 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: 
   - Final NN state: 3P0 implies S=1, L=1, J=0.
   - For T(NN)=0, Pauli requires S+L+1=0 (mod 2). Here, 1+1+1=3, which is 1 (mod 2), not allowed.

2. 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: 
   - Final NN state: 7D1 implies S=3, L=2, J=1.
   - For T(NN)=0, Pauli requires S+L+1=0 (mod 2). Here, 3+2+1=6, which is 0 (mod 2), allowed.

3. 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: 
   - Final NN state: 3D3 implies S=1, L=2, J=3.
   - For T(NN)=0, Pauli requires S+L+1=0 (mod 2). Here, 1+2+1=4, which is 0 (mod 2), allowed.

4. 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: 
   - Final NN state: 3S1 implies S=1, L=0, J=1.
   - For T(NN)=0, Pauli requires S+L+1=0 (mod 2). Here, 1+0+1=2, which is 0 (mod 2), allowed.

Therefore, the option that is not permitted is the one that does not satisfy the Pauli statistics requirement for T(NN)=0.

### thinking by Debate Agent rebD:
The initial state is 1S0, meaning S = 0, L = 0, J = 0, and T(NN) = 0. For the final state, T(NN) = 0, and we need to check the conservation of angular momentum and parity. The intrinsic parity of particle X is -1, so the parity of the final NN state and particle X must be the same as the initial state (which is positive for 1S0). The parity of a state L is (-1)^L. Therefore, the parity of the final state must be (-1)^(L(NN) + l), where l is the angular momentum of X. The conservation of angular momentum requires that J(initial) = J(final). Also, Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Now, let&#39;s evaluate each choice: 

Choice 1: 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s. Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 1, J(NN) = 0, l = 0. Parity is (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 = -1, which is not conserved (initial parity is +1). 

Choice 2: 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p. Here, S(NN) = 3, L(NN) = 2, J(NN) = 1, l = 1. Parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = -1, which is not conserved.

Choice 3: 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f. Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 2, J(NN) = 3, l = 3. Parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 = -1, which is not conserved.

Choice 4: 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p. Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 0, J(NN) = 1, l = 1. Parity is (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = -1, which is not conserved.

All choices show parity conservation issues, but we need to focus on the angular momentum and isospin constraints. The Pauli constraint T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) must hold. Evaluating this for each choice, choice 1 does not satisfy this constraint because S = 1, L = 1, so T = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (mod 2) = 1, which is not equal to T(NN) = 0.

### thinking by Debate Agent UTaM:
The initial state is a 1S0 state, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. For the final NN state with T(NN) = 0, we must have S(NN) + L(NN) = even, based on T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The particle X has intrinsic parity -1, and we must conserve parity and angular momentum in the transition. Let&#39;s evaluate each choice:

1) 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: Final NN state has S=1, L=1, J=0. Parity = (-1)^1 = -1. Particle X has L=0, parity = (-1)^L * (-1) = -1. Total parity = -1 * -1 = +1.
2) 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: Final NN state has S=3, L=2, J=1. Parity = (-1)^2 = +1. Particle X has L=1, parity = (-1)^L * (-1) = +1. Total parity = +1 * +1 = +1.
3) 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: Final NN state has S=1, L=2, J=3. Parity = (-1)^2 = +1. Particle X has L=3, parity = (-1)^L * (-1) = -1. Total parity = +1 * -1 = -1.
4) 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: Final NN state has S=1, L=0, J=1. Parity = (-1)^0 = +1. Particle X has L=1, parity = (-1)^L * (-1) = +1. Total parity = +1 * +1 = +1.

The initial state parity is (-1)^0 = +1. For parity conservation, the final state parity must also be +1. The transition 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f has a final parity of -1, violating parity conservation.

### thinking by Debate Agent Z1Vz:
The initial NN state is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, and J=0. The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L = +1. The intrinsic parity of the particle X is -1, so the parity of the final NN state must be opposite to maintain overall parity conservation. For each choice, we need to check the parity and the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). For 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s, the final state has S=1, L=1, J=0, and T=0. Parity is (-1)^L = -1, and the condition T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) holds as 0 = 1 + 1 + 1 (mod 2). For 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p, the final state has S=3, L=2, J=1, and T=0. Parity is (-1)^L = +1, and the condition does not hold as 0 = 3 + 2 + 1 (mod 2) gives 0 = 6 (mod 2), which is not true. For 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f, the final state has S=1, L=2, J=3, and T=0. Parity is (-1)^L = +1, and the condition holds as 0 = 1 + 2 + 1 (mod 2) gives 0 = 4 (mod 2). For 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p, the final state has S=1, L=0, J=1, and T=0. Parity is (-1)^L = +1, and the condition holds as 0 = 1 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) gives 0 = 2 (mod 2). Therefore, the partial wave not permitted is 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p.

    <pre>To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics requirement. The initial state is 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0, and parity is +1. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1. For the final NN state with T(NN)=0, Pauli statistics require S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 = 0 (mod 2). We also need to conserve parity and angular momentum. Let&#39;s evaluate each choice:

1) 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s: Final NN state has S=1, L=1, J=0. Parity = (-1)^1 = -1. Particle X has L=0, parity = (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1. Total parity = -1 * -1 = +1. Pauli condition: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (mod 2) = 1, not allowed.

2) 1S0 -&gt; 7D1 + p: Final NN state has S=3, L=2, J=1. Parity = (-1)^2 = +1. Particle X has L=1, parity = (-1)^1 * (-1) = +1. Total parity = +1 * +1 = +1. Pauli condition: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 (mod 2) = 0, allowed.

3) 1S0 -&gt; 3D3 + f: Final NN state has S=1, L=2, J=3. Parity = (-1)^2 = +1. Particle X has L=3, parity = (-1)^3 * (-1) = -1. Total parity = +1 * -1 = -1, not conserved.

4) 1S0 -&gt; 3S1 + p: Final NN state has S=1, L=0, J=1. Parity = (-1)^0 = +1. Particle X has L=1, parity = (-1)^1 * (-1) = +1. Total parity = +1 * +1 = +1. Pauli condition: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (mod 2) = 0, allowed.

The option that is not permitted due to the Pauli condition is 1S0 -&gt; 3P0 + s, as it does not satisfy the requirement T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).
