Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The series of reactions involves several transformations starting with a bromo compound. The first step with H2O likely replaces the bromine with an OH group, forming an alcohol (A). The second step with PDC oxidizes the alcohol to a ketone (B). The Wittig reaction with H2CPPh3 converts the ketone to an alkene (C). Finally, treatment with TsOH could lead to dehydration or rearrangement, forming a more stable alkene (D). Considering the choices, choice A) seems to match the expected structure after these transformations, as it reflects the formation of a more stable alkene structure.
