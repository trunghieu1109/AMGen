Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi) opens each epoxide at the less hindered carbon, installing a Me there and leaving an OH on the more substituted carbon, while leaving the remaining alkene and ketone intact. The only choice matching a product with one ketone, one alkene, one alcohol, and the correct methyl substitution pattern is 5\u2010hydroxy\u20103,3,6,6\u2010tetramethylhept\u20101\u2010en\u20104\u2010one.\n\nAnswer:C)",
