Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: After analyzing the various perspectives and reasoning provided by the debate agents, it is clear that the treatment of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst leads to a ring-closing metathesis reaction. The agents have considered the stereochemistry and the potential for different product configurations. The consensus among the agents who concluded that there are 6 unique products (excluding ethene) seems to be more robust, as they accounted for the racemic nature of the starting material and the resulting stereoisomers. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the number of possible products is 6.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
