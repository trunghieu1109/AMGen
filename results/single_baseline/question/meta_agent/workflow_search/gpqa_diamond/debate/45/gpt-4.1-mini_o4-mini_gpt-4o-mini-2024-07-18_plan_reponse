        "response": "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes self-metathesis to give the internal alkene A\u2013CH=CH\u2013A (excluding ethene). Each product has two stereocenters (the original C3 centers) plus E/Z double-bond geometry. The possible stereochemical combinations are RR and SS (enantiomer pair) and the meso RS, for each of E and Z. That gives 3 stereoisomers for E and 3 for Z, total 6.\n\nAnswer:B)",
