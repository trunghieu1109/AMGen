Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes self-metathesis to give the internal alkene A–CH=CH–A (excluding ethene). Each product has two stereocenters (the original C3 centers) plus E/Z double-bond geometry. The possible stereochemical combinations are RR and SS (enantiomer pair) and the meso RS, for each of E and Z. That gives 3 stereoisomers for E and 3 for Z, total 6.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
