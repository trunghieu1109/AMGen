        "response": "The problem involves the metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene using Grubbs catalyst. The racemic mixture means there are two enantiomers of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Each enantiomer can undergo metathesis with itself or with the other enantiomer, leading to different dimeric products. The metathesis can result in head-to-head or head-to-tail dimers, and each of these can have cis and trans stereoisomers. Therefore, for each pair of enantiomers, there are two possible stereoisomeric products. Since there are two enantiomers, there are 4 pairs in total, leading to 4 x 2 = 8 possible products. Excluding ethene, the number of distinct products is 8.\n\nAnswer:C)",
