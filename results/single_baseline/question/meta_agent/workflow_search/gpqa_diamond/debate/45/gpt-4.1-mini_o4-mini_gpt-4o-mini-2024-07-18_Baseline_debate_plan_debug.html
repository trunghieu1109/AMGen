### thinking by Debate Agent ENDl:
We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, so each molecule is R or S at C3. Self-metathesis produces the internal alkene R–CH=CH–R plus ethene (excluded). The new alkene is internal and has E/Z stereochemistry, and each R group retains its stereocenter. Thus the product has two stereocenters plus the double bond stereochemistry. There are three stereoisomers for each E and each Z: (R,R), (S,S) which are enantiomeric, and the meso (R,S). That gives 3 E-isomers and 3 Z-isomers, total 6 distinct products.

### thinking by Debate Agent Hj0Z:
We have racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (a terminal alkene with a chiral center at C3). In self‐metathesis (Grubbs catalyst), two alkene molecules react to give an internal alkene (R–CH=CH–R) plus ethene (excluded). The product carries two stereogenic centers (the original C3’s) and an E/Z double bond.

Label the chiral substituent R*. Coupling R*+R* gives an RR product (chiral) which has an enantiomer SS; that’s one enantiomeric pair. Coupling R*+S* gives an RS product, which by symmetry is meso (identical to SR). Each of these three stereochemical combinations (RR, SS, meso) can exist in two alkene geometries, E or Z.

Thus we have:
- RR‐E and SS‐E (enantiomer pair)
- RR‐Z and SS‐Z (enantiomer pair)
- meso‐E
- meso‐Z
Total stereoisomers (excluding ethene) = 6.

### thinking by Debate Agent ieey:
The substrate is a terminal alkene (racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene). Grubbs catalyst mediates self‐metathesis giving ethene plus a single heavy internal alkene (the dimer). That dimer can exist as E or Z, so excluding ethene there are 2 products. Racemization at C3 doesn’t add new heavy products (it gives enantiomeric pairs that are counted within the E/Z isomers).

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Iqo:
3-Methylpent-1-ene (CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3) is chiral at C3; a racemate gives both R and S. Grubbs self-metathesis yields R–CH=CH–R + ethene. The internal alkene has E and Z isomers. Each product has two stereocenters (one in each R fragment), giving RR and SS (an enantiomer pair) plus the RS meso form. That’s 3 stereoisomers for E and 3 for Z, total 6 (excluding ethene).
