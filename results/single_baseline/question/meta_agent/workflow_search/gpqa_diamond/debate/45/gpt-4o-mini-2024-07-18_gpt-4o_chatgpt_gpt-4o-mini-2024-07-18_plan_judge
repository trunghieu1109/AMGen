Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene consists of two enantiomers. When treated with Grubbs catalyst, a metathesis reaction occurs, which can form different alkene products by rearranging the carbon-carbon double bonds. Each enantiomer can react with itself or with the other enantiomer, leading to different dimeric products. The possible products are determined by the different ways the double bonds can rearrange, considering both structural and stereochemical isomers. Excluding ethene, we need to count the unique dimeric products formed. The number of distinct products is determined by the combinations of the enantiomers and the resulting stereochemistry of the dimers.
