Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In Cartesian coordinates: V(r,θ) = ½k(x²+y²) + 3/2k x² = 2k x² + ½k y², so the system is two independent harmonic oscillators with ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m). The energy levels are E = (n_x+½)ħω_x + (n_y+½)ħω_y = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), which corresponds to choice A).
