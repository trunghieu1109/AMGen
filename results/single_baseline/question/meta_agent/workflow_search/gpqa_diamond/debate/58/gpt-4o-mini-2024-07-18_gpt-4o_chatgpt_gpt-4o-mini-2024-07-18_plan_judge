Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the pH of the solution, we need to consider the moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each component. CH3COOH is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Calculate the moles: CH3COOH = 0.05 mol, HCl = 0.08 mol, Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 mol, which gives 0.18 mol of OH- (since Ba(OH)2 dissociates into 2 OH- ions). The total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH is 0.13 mol. The excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol. The total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH- is 0.0417 M. The pOH is -log(0.0417) â‰ˆ 1.38, and the pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. This matches choice B.
