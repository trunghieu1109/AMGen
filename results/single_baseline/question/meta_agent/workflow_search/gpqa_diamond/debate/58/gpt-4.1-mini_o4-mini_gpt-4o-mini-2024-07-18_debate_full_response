Neutralization: 0.18−0.08=0.10 mol OH− remains; it reacts with 0.05 mol CH₃COOH to form 0.05 mol CH₃COO−, leaving 0.05 mol OH−. Total volume=1.2 L → [OH−]=0.05/1.2=0.0417 M → pOH≈1.38 → pH=14−1.38=12.62.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent e8Ea:\nFirst calculate moles of each component:\n- CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 mol\n- HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+ strong acid\n- Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH– strong base\n\nNext, neutralize strong acid and weak acid with strong base:\n- OH– (0.18 mol) neutralizes H+ (0.08 mol) → 0.10 mol OH– remains\n- Remaining OH– (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol) → all acetic acid consumed, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO– and leaving 0.05 mol OH–\n\nTotal volume = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L\n[OH–] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\npOH = −log(0.04167) ≈ 1.3802\npH = 14 − 1.3802 ≈ 12.62\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zUtU:\nCalculate moles: HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+; Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH–; CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 mol weak acid. Neutralization: 0.08 mol H+ + 0.08 mol OH– → net 0.10 mol OH– left; then 0.05 mol OH– neutralizes 0.05 mol CH3COOH → 0.05 mol OH– remaining and 0.05 mol CH3COO– formed.
