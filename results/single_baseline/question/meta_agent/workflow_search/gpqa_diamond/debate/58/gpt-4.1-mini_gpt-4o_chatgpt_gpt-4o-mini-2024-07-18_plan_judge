Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents calculated the moles of each component correctly: CH3COOH (0.05 moles), HCl (0.08 moles), and Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles of OH-). The net reaction involves neutralizing H+ from HCl with OH- from Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted. The concentration of OH- is 0.0833 M in the total volume of 1.2 L. The pOH is calculated as -log(0.0833) â‰ˆ 1.08, leading to a pH of 14 - 1.08 = 12.92. However, the agents made a mistake in the excess OH- calculation. The correct excess OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to a concentration of 0.0417 M, a pOH of 1.38, and a pH of 12.62. Therefore, the correct choice is B).
