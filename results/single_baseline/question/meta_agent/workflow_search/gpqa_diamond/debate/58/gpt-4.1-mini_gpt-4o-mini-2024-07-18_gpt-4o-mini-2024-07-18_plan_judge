Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the pH of the solution, we need to calculate the total moles of each component: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. The total volume of the solution is 1200 mL. The moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles, HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles, and Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles of OH- (since Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH- per mole). The total moles of H+ from acids = 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 moles H+. The net effect shows that there are more OH- than H+, indicating a basic solution. The excess OH- = 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles. The concentration of OH- = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M. Calculating pOH gives pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38, and thus pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. The closest answer to this calculation is 12.62, which corresponds to choice B.
