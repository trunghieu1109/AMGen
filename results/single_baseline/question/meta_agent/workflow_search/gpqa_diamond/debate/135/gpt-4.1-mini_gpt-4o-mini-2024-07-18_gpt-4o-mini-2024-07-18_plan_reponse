            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 in a sphere of radius R, we can apply the Divergence Theorem. The divergence of a radial field in spherical coordinates can be computed, and since f(r) is a radial field, its divergence can be computed directly. The divergence of f in spherical coordinates results in a constant value, which when integrated over the sphere gives a non-zero result. The correct answer corresponds to the total flux through the surface of the sphere, which is 4\u03c0. Therefore, the most appropriate answer for the integral is '4 \u03c0'.\n\nAnswer:B",
