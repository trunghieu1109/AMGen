    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;4 π&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;4/3 π R &#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent Rn4C:
The divergence theorem states ∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∮_S f·dS. Here f = (1/r^2) r̂. On a sphere of radius R, f = (1/R^2) r̂ and dS = R^2 sinθ dθ dφ r̂, so f·dS = sinθ dθ dφ. Integrating θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π gives 4π.

### thinking by Debate Agent sAT1:
The field is f=êr/r². Everywhere except at the origin, ∇·f=0 but there is a singularity at r=0. By the divergence theorem, ∫V∇·f dV=∮S f·dS. On the sphere r=R, f·dS=(1/R²)(R² sinθ dθ dφ)=sinθ dθ dφ, integrating over θ,φ gives 4π.

### thinking by Debate Agent Yi7D:
We have a vector field f(r)=r̂/r^2. For r≠0, div f=0, but there is a singular at the origin. By the divergence theorem, ∫_V (div f) dV = ∮_S f·dA. On a sphere of radius R, f·dA = (1/R^2)(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ)=sinθ dθ dφ, so the flux is ∫_0^{2π}∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ=4π. Therefore the volume integral of the divergence inside the sphere is 4π.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6k6l:
We have f(r)=1/r^2 in radial direction. Its divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where there’s a singularity. By Gauss’s divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere equals the flux of f through the sphere’s surface. The radial flux is f(R)*4πR^2 = (1/R^2)*4πR^2 = 4π.
