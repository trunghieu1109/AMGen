            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 in spherical coordinates. The field is radial, so f(r) = (1/r^2) r\u0302. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by: \u2207.f = (1/r^2) \u2202/\u2202r (r^2 f_r). Since the field has only a radial component, f_r = 1/r^2, so \u2207.f = (1/r^2) \u2202/\u2202r (r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) \u2202/\u2202r (1) = 0. Thus, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere inside the sphere. The volume integral of zero over any volume is zero. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
