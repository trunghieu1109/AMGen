            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field that falls off as 1/r^2 radially. The divergence of this field is zero everywhere except at the origin. By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence over a sphere is equal to the flux through the surface of the sphere. The field has a total flux of 4\u03c0 through any enclosing surface, but since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the volume integral itself is zero. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
