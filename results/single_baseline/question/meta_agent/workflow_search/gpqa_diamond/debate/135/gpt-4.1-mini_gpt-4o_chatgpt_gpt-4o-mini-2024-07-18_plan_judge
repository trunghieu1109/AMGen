Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 in spherical coordinates. The field is radial, so f(r) = (1/r^2) r̂. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by: ∇.f = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r (r^2 f_r). Since the field has only a radial component, f_r = 1/r^2, so ∇.f = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r (r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r (1) = 0. Thus, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere inside the sphere. The volume integral of zero over any volume is zero. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 0.
