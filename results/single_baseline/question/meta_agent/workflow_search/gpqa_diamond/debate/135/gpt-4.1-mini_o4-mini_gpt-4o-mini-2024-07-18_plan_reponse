            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

Here f = r\u0302/r^2, so on the sphere of radius R, f\u00b7dA = (1/R^2)(R^2 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6) = sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. Integrating over \u03b8 and \u03c6 gives 4\u03c0. Hence the volume integral equals 4\u03c0.\n\nAnswer:B)",
