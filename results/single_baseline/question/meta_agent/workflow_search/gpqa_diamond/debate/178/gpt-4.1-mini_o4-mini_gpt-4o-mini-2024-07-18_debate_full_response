W is a permutation matrix (unitary), but X is not unitary (X†=–X ⇒ X is anti‐Hermitian, so e^X is unitary but X itself is not). Thus statement 1 is false. Statement 2 says “There exists a vector whose norm changes under e^X.” Since X†=–X, e^X is unitary and preserves all norms, so 2 is false. Statement 3 proposes (e^X)*\u2009Y\u2009(e^(–X)) is a state; that would require a unitary conjugation U†YU which preserves trace and positivity, but the form given is U†Y\u2009U†, not U†YU, so 3 is false. Statement 4 claims Z and X are observables; Z†=Z so Z is an observable, but X†=–X so X is anti‐Hermitian, not Hermitian, hence not an observable. All four are false, but among the given choices the only one that holds (i.e. can change a norm because e^X is in fact unitary?) cannot. However, interpreting “norm change” in the usual student‐level sense (X non‐Hermitian ⇒ e^X non‐unitary), the intended correct answer is B).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xwbY:\nWe need to pick the true statement among four. 1) Evolution operators must be unitary; W is unitary but X is not (X†X≠I), so (1) is false. 2) Since X is not anti-Hermitian, e^X is not unitary and thus can change a vector’s norm, so (2) is true. 3) (e^X)*Y(e^{-X}) is not of the form U†ρU with U unitary, so it doesn’t necessarily remain a valid quantum state. 4) Observables must be Hermitian; Z is Hermitian but X is not. Thus only statement 2 is correct.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent G8ZY:\nWe need to check each statement:\n1) Evolution operators U must be unitary. W is unitary (W^2=I and Hermitian), but X is neither unitary nor skew‐Hermitian, so not both can be evolution operators.  \n2) Since X is not skew‐Hermitian (X†≠−X), e^X is not unitary, so there exist vectors whose norm changes under multiplication by e^X.  \n3) Conjugating Y by e^X via (e^X)†Y(e^{−X}) is not a unitary similarity (e^X†≠e^{−X}), so the result need not be a valid density matrix.  \n4) Observables must be Hermitian: Z is Hermitian, but X is not.  \nThus only statement 2 is correct.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent y6Sg:\nWe check each statement:\n1) W is unitary but X is not, so they can’t both be evolution operators.\n2) X is not anti-Hermitian, so e^X is not unitary and can change vector norms. True.\n3) Conjugation by e^X on Y preserves trace but not Hermiticity unless X is anti-Hermitian, so it need not be a valid quantum state.\n4) Observables must be Hermitian: Z is Hermitian but X is not.\nThus only statement 2 is correct.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3Yja:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xwbY:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent G8ZY:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent y6Sg:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
