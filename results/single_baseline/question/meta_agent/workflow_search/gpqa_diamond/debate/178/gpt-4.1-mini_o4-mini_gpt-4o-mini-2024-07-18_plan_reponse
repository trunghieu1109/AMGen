            "The study of quantum mechanics deals with a lot of matrices. Consider the following matrices. \n\nW = (0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0), \nX = (i, -1, 2i; 1, 0, 1;  2i, -1, -i),\nY = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2; 0.1, 0.25, 0.1; 0.2, 0.1, 0.25)\nZ - (3, 2i, 5; -2i, -2, -4i; 5, 4i, 4)\n\nNote.

Thus X cannot directly serve as an evolution operator. Statement 1 is false.\n2) Because X\u2020=\u2212X, e^X is unitary, so it preserves all vector norms. Statement 2 is false.\n3) They write (e^X)*Y(e^{\u2212X}) = U\u2020YU\u2020, not U\u2020YU, so neither trace nor positivity is guaranteed to match a valid density operator. Statement 3 is false.\n4) Observables must be Hermitian; Z is Hermitian but X is anti\u2010Hermitian. Statement 4 is false.\nNo statement is correct.\n\nAnswer:None of the statements is correct.",
