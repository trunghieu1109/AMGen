Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The proton–antiproton annihilation at rest provides 2m_pc²=2×938MeV=1876MeV. Four A particles require 4×300MeV=1200MeV rest energy, leaving 676MeV kinetic energy, i.e. 169MeV per A. Each A’s total energy is 300+169=469MeV, so γ=469/300≈1.563 and β=√(1−1/γ²)≈0.7686≈0.77.
