Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the initial energy calculation: the total energy from the proton and antiproton is 1876 MeV. The rest mass energy of the four A particles is 1200 MeV, leaving 676 MeV for kinetic energy. Each A particle thus has 169 MeV of kinetic energy, making their total energy 469 MeV. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, we solve for velocity. Agent HOac and fyLT both calculated the velocity to be approximately 0.86c, which seems consistent with the energy distribution and relativistic calculations. Therefore, the most consistent answer is 0.86c.
