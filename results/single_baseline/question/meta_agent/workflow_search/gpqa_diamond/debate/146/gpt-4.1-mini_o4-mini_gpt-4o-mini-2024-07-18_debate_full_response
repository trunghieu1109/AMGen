Rest energy needed for 4 A’s is 4×300 = 1200 MeV. Leftover kinetic energy = 1876−1200 = 676 MeV, shared equally → 169 MeV each. Total energy per A: E = 300+169 = 469 MeV. Momentum p c = sqrt(E^2−(mc^2)^2) = sqrt(469^2−300^2) ≈ 360.5 MeV. Thus β = pc/E ≈ 360.5/469 ≈ 0.769 → 0.77c.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent CYkJ:\nWe have proton and antiproton annihilating almost at rest, so total initial energy E_i ≃2 m_p c^2 =2·938 MeV=1876 MeV. They produce four particles A each with rest mass m_A c^2=300 MeV, so total rest energy E_rest=4·300=1200 MeV. The available kinetic energy is E_kin=E_i−E_rest=1876−1200=676 MeV, equally shared gives each A KE=676/4=169 MeV. The total energy per A is E=300+169=469 MeV, so γ=E/(m_A c^2)=469/300≈1.563. Then β=√(1−1/γ^2)=√(1−1/1.563^2)=√(1−0.4093)=√0.5907≈0.768≈0.77 c.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent HOac:\nTotal energy available ≈2m_p c^2=2×938=1876 MeV. Needed rest energy for 4 A’s=4×300=1200 MeV, so kinetic energy leftover=676 MeV. Each A gets 676/4=169 MeV KE, so E_total per A=300+169=469 MeV. γ=469/300≈1.563, β=√(1−1/γ^2)=√(1−1/2.4437)≈0.7686≈0.77c.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fyLT:\nWe assume the proton and antiproton annihilate essentially at rest so total available energy is 2\u2009m_p\u2009c²≈2×938\u2009MeV=1876\u2009MeV. This is shared equally among the four A particles, so each has total energy E=1876/4≈469\u2009MeV. With m_A\u2009c²=300\u2009MeV, the Lorentz factor γ=E/(m_A\u2009c²)=469/300≈1.563. Thus β=√(1–1/γ²)=√(1–1/1.563²)=√0.591≈0.769≈0.77\u2009c.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YaoA:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent CYkJ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent HOac:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fyLT:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
