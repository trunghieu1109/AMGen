        "response": "All agents agree that the total initial energy is the rest energy of the proton and antiproton, which is 1876 MeV. The rest energy of the four A particles is 1200 MeV, leaving 676 MeV as kinetic energy. Each A particle thus has 169 MeV of kinetic energy. The total energy per A particle is 469 MeV. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, the velocity is calculated. Three agents (YaoA, CYkJ, HOac) agree that the velocity is approximately 0.91c, while one agent (fyLT) calculates it as 0.86c. The majority consensus is 0.91c, which corresponds to choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
