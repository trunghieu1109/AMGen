Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The lowest-energy transition from the ground state is the first vibrational excitation (v=0→1), since rotational transitions have much lower energy and would correspond to much smaller photon momenta than the options listed. The vibrational quantum is ΔE=ħω=(1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s)(4×10¹⁴ s⁻¹)≈4.22×10⁻²⁰ J. The photon momentum is p=ΔE/c≈4.22×10⁻²⁰ J/(3×10⁸ m/s)≈1.41×10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s, matching choice 4.
