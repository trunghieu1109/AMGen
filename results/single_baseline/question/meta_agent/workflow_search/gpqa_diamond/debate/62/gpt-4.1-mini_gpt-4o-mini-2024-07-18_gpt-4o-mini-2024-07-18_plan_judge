Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next vibrational state, we need to calculate the energy of the photon using the formula E = h * w, where h is Planck's constant and w is the angular frequency of vibration. The momentum p of the photon can be calculated using the relationship p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. The energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state can be approximated using the angular frequency of vibration (w). After calculating the energy and then the momentum, we can compare the results with the provided choices. The calculations indicate that the correct momentum is p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s, which matches one of the provided choices.
