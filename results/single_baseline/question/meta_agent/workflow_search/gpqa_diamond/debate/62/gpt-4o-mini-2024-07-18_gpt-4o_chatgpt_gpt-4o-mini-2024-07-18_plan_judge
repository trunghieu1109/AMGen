Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule transitions from J=0 to J=1, with n=0 remaining constant. The reduced mass μ is calculated as (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = 1.818 amu, converted to kg as 3.02 * 10^(-27) kg. The moment of inertia I is μR² = 1.21 * 10^(-46) kg*m². The rotational energy difference ΔE_rot is (h² / (8π²I)) * (J+1) for J=0 to J=1. The vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is ħw. The total energy difference ΔE = ΔE_rot + ΔE_vib. The momentum of the photon is p = ΔE / c. Calculating these values, the correct choice is D) p = 1.4 * 10^(-28) N*s.
