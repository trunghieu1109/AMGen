### thinking by Debate Agent 7yLU:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state of the molecule in the non-rigid rotor model. The energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by E = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I) + (n+1/2)ħw, where J is the rotational quantum number, I is the moment of inertia, n is the vibrational quantum number, ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant, and w is the angular frequency of vibration. For the fundamental state, J = 0 and n = 0. For the first excited state with the lowest energy, we consider J = 1 and n = 0. The moment of inertia I is calculated as I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule, given by μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). We convert the atomic mass units (amu) to kg and the bond length from angstroms to meters to calculate I. Once we have I, we calculate the energy difference ΔE between the two states. The momentum of the absorbed photon is given by p = ΔE/c, where c is the speed of light. Calculating these values step by step, we can determine the correct choice.

To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to consider the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels are given by E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + BJ(J + 1), where v is the vibrational quantum number, J is the rotational quantum number, ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant, and B is the rotational constant. For the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we can assume a transition from v = 0, J = 0 to v = 0, J = 1. The energy difference is ΔE = B(1 * (1 + 1)) = 2B. The rotational constant B is calculated using B = ħ^2 / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia I = μR^2 and μ is the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). After calculating μ and I, we find B, then ΔE, and use the relation p = ΔE/c, where c is the speed of light, to find the momentum of the photon.

### thinking by Debate Agent 90nZ:
To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to consider the energy changes in the molecule as it transitions to the next state. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The molecule can transition between these levels by absorbing or emitting a photon. The energy of a photon is given by E = h\nu, where h is Planck&#39;s constant and \nu is the frequency. The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. 

First, compute the reduced mass (\mu) of the diatomic molecule: \mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu = 1.818 amu. Convert this to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66053906660 * 10^(-27) kg/amu = 3.02 * 10^(-27) kg.

Next, calculate the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule: I = \mu * R^2 = 3.02 * 10^(-27) kg * (2 * 10^(-10) m)^2 = 1.208 * 10^(-46) kg m^2.

The rotational energy difference between levels J and J+1 is given by \DeltaE_rot = (h^2 / (8 * \pi^2 * I)) * (J+1). For the fundamental state, J = 0, so \DeltaE_rot = h^2 / (8 * \pi^2 * I).

Now, calculate the vibrational energy difference using \DeltaE_vib = \hbar * w. The energy change for the lowest possible transition (fundamental state to the next state) is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

Finally, calculate the momentum of the photon: p = (\DeltaE_rot + \DeltaE_vib) / c.

Substitute the values and solve for p, then match it to the given choices.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8rPV:
First, we need to calculate the reduced mass of the molecule using the formula: μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Given Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu, the reduced mass μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 1.818 amu. Convert this to kg by multiplying by 1.66 * 10^(-27) kg/amu, resulting in μ ≈ 3.02 * 10^(-27) kg. The energy difference between rotational states in a diatomic molecule is given by ΔE_rot = (h^2 / 8π^2I) * (J + 1), where I is the moment of inertia I = μ * R^2. Using R = 2 * 10^(-10) m, I = 3.02 * 10^(-27) * (2 * 10^(-10))^2 ≈ 1.21 * 10^(-46) kg*m^2. For the lowest rotational transition (J = 0 to J = 1), ΔE_rot = (h^2 / 8π^2 * 1.21 * 10^(-46)) * 1. Using h ≈ 6.63 * 10^(-34) J*s, ΔE_rot ≈ 5.44 * 10^(-23) J. For vibrational transitions, ΔE_vib = ħw, where ħ = h / 2π. So, ΔE_vib = (6.63 * 10^(-34) / 2π) * 4 * 10^14 ≈ 4.22 * 10^(-20) J. The total energy for the transition is ΔE = ΔE_rot + ΔE_vib ≈ 4.22 * 10^(-20) J. The momentum of the absorbed photon is p = ΔE / c, where c = 3 * 10^8 m/s. Therefore, p = 4.22 * 10^(-20) / 3 * 10^8 ≈ 1.4 * 10^(-28) N*s.
