        "response": "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited state in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule transitions from J=0 to J=1, with n=0 remaining constant. The reduced mass \u03bc is calculated as (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = 1.818 amu, converted to kg as 3.02 * 10^(-27) kg. The moment of inertia I is \u03bcR\u00b2 = 1.21 * 10^(-46) kg*m\u00b2. The rotational energy difference \u0394E_rot is (h\u00b2 / (8\u03c0\u00b2I)) * (J+1) for J=0 to J=1. The vibrational energy difference \u0394E_vib is \u0127w. The total energy difference \u0394E = \u0394E_rot + \u0394E_vib. The momentum of the photon is p = \u0394E / c. Calculating these values, the correct choice is D) p = 1.4 * 10^(-28) N*s.\n\nAnswer:D)",
