Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the momentum of a photon absorbed by a diatomic molecule transitioning from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The molecule can undergo either a rotational or vibrational transition. The rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) typically requires less energy than the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1). The rotational constant B is calculated using the moment of inertia I, which depends on the reduced mass μ and bond length R. After calculating B, the energy difference for the rotational transition is ΔE = 2B. The momentum of the photon is then p = ΔE / c. The calculations show that the energy difference for the rotational transition is small, leading to a small momentum value. The majority of agents agree on choice B) as the closest match to the calculated momentum value, considering possible rounding or approximation errors.
