Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the potential energy at maximum amplitude to the relativistic kinetic energy at maximum speed. The correct expression for the maximum speed involves solving for v in terms of the relativistic factor \( \gamma \), which is derived from the energy conservation equation. The correct choice is the one that matches the derived expression for \( v_{max} = c\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}} \). This matches choice B.
