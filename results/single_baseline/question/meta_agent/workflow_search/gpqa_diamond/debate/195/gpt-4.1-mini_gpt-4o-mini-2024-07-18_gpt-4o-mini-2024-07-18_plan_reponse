        "response": "To determine the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we analyze the provided choices in the context of relativistic mechanics. The maximum speed must account for the relativistic effects that modify the classical harmonic oscillator's behavior. After evaluating the choices, it is clear that choice 2 incorporates the necessary relativistic corrections and aligns with the principles of energy conservation in a relativistic framework. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.\n\nAnswer:B",
