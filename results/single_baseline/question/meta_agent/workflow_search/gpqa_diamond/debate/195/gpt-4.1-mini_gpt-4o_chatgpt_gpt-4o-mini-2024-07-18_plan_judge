Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the relativistic kinetic energy to the potential energy at maximum amplitude. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA^2. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc^2, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Solving for gamma, we have gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Substituting this into the expression for gamma, we solve for v_max and find that v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This matches choice 2.
