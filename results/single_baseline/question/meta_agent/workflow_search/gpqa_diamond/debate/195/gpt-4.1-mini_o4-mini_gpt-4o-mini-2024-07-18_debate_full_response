At x=0, all energy is kinetic: γmc^2 = E, so γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Then 1/√(1−v^2/c^2) = 1+α ⇒ 1−v^2/c^2 = 1/(1+α)^2 ⇒ v^2 = c^2[1 − 1/(1+α)^2], with α=kA^2/(2mc^2). Thus v_max = c√(1 − 1/(1+ kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), matching choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent l17v:\nWe use energy conservation: total energy E = kinetic + potential. For a relativistic particle, kinetic energy T = (γ−1)mc², with γ = 1/√(1−v²/c²), and potential energy U = ½k x². At maximum displacement x = A, v=0 so E = mc² + ½kA². At x=0, U=0 so E = γ_max mc² → γ_max = 1 + kA²/(2mc²). Then v_max = c√(1−1/γ_max²) = c√(1−1/(1 + kA²/(2mc²))²). This matches choice2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ri8J:\nWe use energy conservation: total energy E = γmc^2 + ½k x^2. At turning point x=A, v=0 so E = mc^2 + ½kA^2. At x=0 (max speed), γ_max = E/(mc^2) = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). Then v_max = c√(1 – 1/γ_max^2) = c√[1 – 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2], which matches choice B).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent HtXl:\nWe use conservation of energy: total energy at turning point x=A is E = mc^2 + ½kA^2. At x=0, all energy is kinetic: E = γmc^2 so γ = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). Then v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/γ^2) = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which matches choice 2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent gCMx:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent l17v:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ri8J:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent HtXl:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
