The lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV·s). Given Γ = 320 MeV, τ = (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV·s) / 320 MeV = 2.0569 * 10^-24 s. The velocity v can be found using the relativistic relation v = pc/E, where p is the momentum and E is the energy. The momentum p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2), where E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt((8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2) = 7.91 GeV. Then v = (7.91 GeV) * c / (8 GeV). The mean decay distance d = v * τ = (7.91/8) * c * 2.0569 * 10^-24 s. Using c = 3 * 10^8 m/s, d ≈ 5.0223 * 10^-15 m.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Z1b7:\nTo find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to use the relation between the lifetime \\( \\tau \\) and the width \\( \\Gamma \\) of the resonance: \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\).

First, calculate the mean lifetime τ using τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (6.5821 x 10^-22 MeV·s). So, τ = 6.5821 x 10^-22 MeV·s / 320 MeV = 2.0569 x 10^-24 s. Next, calculate β and γ using βγ = p/m, where p is the momentum. Since E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4, solve for p: p = sqrt((E/c)^2 - m^2c^2). With E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, p = sqrt((8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2) = 7.91 GeV/c. Then, βγ = p/m = 7.91 GeV/c / 1.2 GeV = 6.5917. Finally, d = c * τ * βγ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) * (2.0569 x 10^-24 s) * 6.5917 = 4.0655 x 10^-15 m.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xsp9:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Z1b7:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ZZ5z:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eJHn:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
