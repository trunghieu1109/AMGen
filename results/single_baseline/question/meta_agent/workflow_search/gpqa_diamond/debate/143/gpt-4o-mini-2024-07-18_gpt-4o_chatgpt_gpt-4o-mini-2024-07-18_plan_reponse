        "response": "To determine the mean decay distance, we need to calculate the lifetime \u03c4 using the width \u0393 and then find the decay distance using the velocity of the meson. The lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u0127/\u0393, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV\u00b7s). Given \u0393 = 320 MeV, \u03c4 = (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV\u00b7s) / 320 MeV = 2.0569 * 10^-24 s. The velocity factor \u03b2\u03b3 can be calculated using the energy E and mass m of the particle: \u03b2\u03b3 = E/m. Given E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, \u03b2\u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. The mean decay distance d = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2\u03b3 = (3 * 10^8 m/s) * (2.0569 * 10^-24 s) * 6.6667 = 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. Therefore, the correct choice is C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
