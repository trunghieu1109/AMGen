### thinking by Debate Agent xsp9:
To find the mean decay distance, we need to calculate the lifetime of the meson X using its width (Γ) and then use its velocity to find the decay distance. The lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV·s). Given Γ = 320 MeV, τ = (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV·s) / 320 MeV = 2.0569 * 10^-24 s. The velocity v can be found using the relativistic relation v = pc/E, where p is the momentum and E is the energy. The momentum p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2), where E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt((8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2) = 7.91 GeV. Then v = (7.91 GeV) * c / (8 GeV). The mean decay distance d = v * τ = (7.91/8) * c * 2.0569 * 10^-24 s. Using c = 3 * 10^8 m/s, d ≈ 5.0223 * 10^-15 m.

### thinking by Debate Agent Z1b7:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to use the relation between the lifetime \( \tau \) and the width \( \Gamma \) of the resonance: \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \). The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau \), where \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( c \) is the speed of light. \( \beta \gamma = \frac{p}{m} \) can be calculated using the energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) of the particle: \( \beta \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \). Given \( E_X = 8 \text{ GeV} \), \( m_X = 1.2 \text{ GeV} \), and \( \Gamma_X = 320 \text{ MeV} \), we can calculate \( \tau \) and then \( L \).

### thinking by Debate Agent ZZ5z:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we use the relation between the decay width \( \Gamma \), the lifetime \( \tau \), and the mean decay distance \( L \). The lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{s} \)). The mean decay distance \( L \) can be calculated using \( L = \tau \cdot c \cdot \beta \gamma \), where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \), and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. First, calculate \( \gamma \) using \( \gamma = \frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}} \). Then, find \( \beta \) using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). Finally, substitute these into the equation for \( L \) to find the mean decay distance.

### thinking by Debate Agent eJHn:
To find the mean decay distance, we can use the formula: d = c * τ * β * γ, where τ is the mean lifetime, β is the velocity factor, and γ is the Lorentz factor. First, calculate the mean lifetime τ using τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (6.5821 x 10^-22 MeV·s). So, τ = 6.5821 x 10^-22 MeV·s / 320 MeV = 2.0569 x 10^-24 s. Next, calculate β and γ using βγ = p/m, where p is the momentum. Since E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4, solve for p: p = sqrt((E/c)^2 - m^2c^2). With E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, p = sqrt((8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2) = 7.91 GeV/c. Then, βγ = p/m = 7.91 GeV/c / 1.2 GeV = 6.5917. Finally, d = c * τ * βγ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) * (2.0569 x 10^-24 s) * 6.5917 = 4.0655 x 10^-15 m.
