Given Γ = 320 MeV, we convert it to Joules using 1 eV = 1.60218 x 10^-19 J. Then, τ = (6.582119 x 10^-22 MeV·s) / 320 MeV. Next, we determine the velocity (v) of the particle using relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 to find momentum p, and velocity v = pc^2/E. Finally, the mean decay distance L is given by L = vτ.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Z1b7:\nTo find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime and use its velocity to find the decay distance.

The lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is given by \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} \\). The mean decay distance \\( L \\) is then \\( L = \\tau \\cdot c \\cdot \\gamma \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} \\).

Then, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = 6.6667 \\).
