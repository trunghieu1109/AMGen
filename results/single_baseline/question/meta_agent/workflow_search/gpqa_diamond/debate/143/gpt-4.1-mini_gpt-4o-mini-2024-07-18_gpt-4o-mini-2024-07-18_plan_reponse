        "response": "To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime using the formula \u03c4 = \u210f / \u0393, where \u210f is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s) and \u0393 is the width of the resonance (320 MeV). After calculating \u03c4, we can find the mean decay distance using the relation d = \u03b2c\u03c4, where \u03b2 is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (c), given by \u03b2 = v/c = E/mc^2. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. We can calculate \u03b2 and then use it to find the mean decay distance. After performing these calculations, the consistent answer across the reasoning is 5.0223 * 10^-16 m, which matches the first and fourth choices provided.\n\nAnswer:5.0223 * 10^-16 m",
