Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime using the formula τ = ℏ / Γ, where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s) and Γ is the width of the resonance (320 MeV). After calculating τ, we can find the mean decay distance using the relation d = βcτ, where β is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (c), given by β = v/c = E/mc^2. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. We can calculate β and then use it to find the mean decay distance. After performing these calculations, the consistent answer across the reasoning is 5.0223 * 10^-16 m, which matches the first and fourth choices provided.
