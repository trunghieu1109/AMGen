### thinking by Debate Agent xsp9:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we first need to calculate its lifetime using the relation between the width (Γ) and the lifetime (τ): τ = ħ/Γ. Given Γ = 320 MeV, we convert it to Joules using 1 eV = 1.60218 x 10^-19 J. Then, τ = (6.582119 x 10^-22 MeV·s) / 320 MeV. Next, we determine the velocity (v) of the particle using relativistic energy-momentum relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 to find momentum p, and velocity v = pc^2/E. Finally, the mean decay distance L is given by L = vτ.

### thinking by Debate Agent Z1b7:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime and use its velocity to find the decay distance. First, calculate the lifetime \( \tau \) using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_{X}} \). Here, \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-22} \text{ MeV}\cdot\text{s} \) and \( \Gamma_{X} = 320 \text{ MeV} \). Then, calculate the velocity of the meson using \( v = \frac{pc}{E_{X}} \), where \( p \) is the momentum found from \( p = \sqrt{E_{X}^2 - m_{X}^2} \). Finally, the mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = v \cdot \tau \cdot c \).

### thinking by Debate Agent ZZ5z:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime and then use its velocity to find the decay distance. The lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \), where \( \Gamma_X = 320 \text{ MeV} \). First, convert \( \Gamma_X \) to joules (1 eV = 1.60218 x 10^-19 J). Then, calculate \( \tau \) using \( \hbar = 6.582119569 x 10^{-22} \text{ MeV s} \). Once we have the lifetime, the velocity can be approximated as \( v = \frac{pc}{E_X} \), where momentum \( p \) can be calculated using \( p = \sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} \) and \( c = 3 x 10^8 \text{ m/s} \). Finally, the decay distance \( d \) is \( d = v \times \tau \).

### thinking by Debate Agent eJHn:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to use the relationship between the decay width, the lifetime, and the mean decay distance. The lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \). The mean decay distance \( L \) is then \( L = \tau \cdot c \cdot \gamma \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \). First, calculate \( \tau \): \( \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-22} \text{ MeV}\cdot\text{s}}{320 \text{ MeV}} = 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \text{s} \). Then, \( \gamma = \frac{8 \text{ GeV}}{1.2 \text{ GeV}} = 6.6667 \). Now, calculate \( L \): \( L = 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \text{s} \times 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \times 6.6667 = 4.118 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m} \). This value is closest to choice 3.
