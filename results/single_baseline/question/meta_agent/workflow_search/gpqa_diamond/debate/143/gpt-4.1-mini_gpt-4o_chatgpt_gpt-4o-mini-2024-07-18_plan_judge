Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the mean decay distance, we need to calculate the lifetime using τ = ħ/Γ, where Γ = 320 MeV. Convert Γ to joules and use ħ = 6.582119569 x 10^-22 MeV·s. The velocity v can be found using the relativistic relation v = pc^2/E, where p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) and E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. The mean decay distance L is L = vτ. Calculating these gives a result closest to choice C.
