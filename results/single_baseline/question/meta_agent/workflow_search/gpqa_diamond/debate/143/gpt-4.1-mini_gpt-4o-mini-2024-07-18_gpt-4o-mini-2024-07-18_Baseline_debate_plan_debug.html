### thinking by Debate Agent 7ZZ5:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we first need to calculate its lifetime using the formula: τ = ℏ / Γ, where ℏ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (approximately 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s) and Γ is the width of the resonance. After calculating τ, we can find the mean decay distance using the relation: d = βcτ, where β is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (c), given by β = v/c = E/mc^2. For a particle with a production energy of E_X and mass m_X, we can calculate β and then use it to find the mean decay distance.

### thinking by Debate Agent zeJH:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can use the relation between the decay width (Gamma) and the mean lifetime (tau) of the particle. The mean lifetime is given by tau = hbar / Gamma, where hbar is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 Js). The mean decay distance can then be calculated using the formula d = beta * gamma * tau, where beta is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (v/c), and gamma is the Lorentz factor. We first need to calculate the energy in terms of the rest mass energy and then determine beta and gamma. The total energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and the rest mass energy m_X = 1.2 GeV. Therefore, beta can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m_X^2 / E_X^2)). After finding beta, we can find gamma using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Finally, we can calculate the mean decay distance using the mean lifetime and the velocity. After performing these calculations, we can compare the results with the provided choices.

To find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, we can use the relation between the width of the resonance and its lifetime. The lifetime (τ) of a particle is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 Js). The mean decay distance (d) can then be calculated using the formula d = βcτ, where β is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light (c). First, we need to calculate the velocity of the meson using its energy and mass. The energy-mass relation gives us the total energy in terms of the rest mass and kinetic energy. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. After determining the lifetime and velocity, we can compute the mean decay distance.

### thinking by Debate Agent XVYj:
To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can use the relationship between the width (Γ) of the resonance and its lifetime (τ), which is given by τ = ℏ / Γ. The mean decay distance (d) can then be calculated using the formula d = βcτ, where β = v/c (the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light) and c is the speed of light. First, we need to calculate τ using Γ = 320 MeV. We convert Γ to SI units (Joules) for consistency. 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, therefore, Γ = 320 MeV = 320 x 10^6 x 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Next, we calculate τ, and then we find β using the energy and mass of the particle to find the mean decay distance.
