Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the mean decay distance, we need to calculate the lifetime τ using the width Γ and then find the decay distance using the velocity of the meson. The lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV·s). Given Γ = 320 MeV, τ = (6.582119569 * 10^-22 MeV·s) / 320 MeV = 2.0569 * 10^-24 s. The velocity factor βγ can be calculated using the energy E and mass m of the particle: βγ = E/m. Given E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, βγ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. The mean decay distance d = c * τ * βγ = (3 * 10^8 m/s) * (2.0569 * 10^-24 s) * 6.6667 = 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. Therefore, the correct choice is C).
