Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Compute the rest-frame lifetime τ = ħ/Γ = (6.582×10⁻²⁵ GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.06×10⁻²⁴ s. The Lorentz factor γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.667, so dilated lifetime τ_lab = γ τ ≈ 1.37×10⁻²³ s. The mean decay distance L = c τ_lab ≈ 3.0×10⁸ m/s × 1.37×10⁻²³ s ≈ 4.11×10⁻¹⁵ m, corresponding to choice C.
