        "response": "To find the mean decay distance, we need to calculate the lifetime using \u03c4 = \u0127/\u0393, where \u0393 = 320 MeV. Convert \u0393 to joules and use \u0127 = 6.582119569 x 10^-22 MeV\u00b7s. The velocity v can be found using the relativistic relation v = pc^2/E, where p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) and E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. The mean decay distance L is L = v\u03c4. Calculating these gives a result closest to choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
