            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",

        "response": "In the original decay, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous due to the presence of two neutrinos (2V) that can take a range of energies, sharing the available energy with the E particles. The endpoint of this spectrum is determined by the maximum energy the E particles can have when the neutrinos take the least energy. In the variant decay, where a single massless particle M is emitted instead of 2V, the energy distribution among the E particles remains continuous because M, being massless, can still take a range of momenta. However, since M is only one particle and massless, it typically carries away less energy than two neutrinos would. This means that the maximum energy available to the E particles (the endpoint) will increase because less energy is carried away by M compared to 2V. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)",
