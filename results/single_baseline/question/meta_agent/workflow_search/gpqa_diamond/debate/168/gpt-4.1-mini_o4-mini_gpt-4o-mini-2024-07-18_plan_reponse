            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",

        "response": "The original 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is a four-body final state (2e+2\u03bd) giving a continuous summed-electron spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two neutrinos by a single massless exotic M leaves a three-body final state (2e+M), which still yields a continuous sum-electron spectrum, but with a different spectral shape. Since M is massless and only one light particle carries away energy, the electrons can carry more energy on average and the kinematic endpoint for their summed energies shifts upward relative to the original continuous spectrum. Thus the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)",
