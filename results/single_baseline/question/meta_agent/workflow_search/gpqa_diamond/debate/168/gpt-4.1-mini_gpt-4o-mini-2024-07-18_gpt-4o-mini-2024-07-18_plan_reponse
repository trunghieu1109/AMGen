            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",

        "response": "In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E, resulting in a continuous spectrum. When one exotic, massless particle M replaces the two particles V, the energy that was previously allocated to the two V particles is now redistributed. Since M is massless, it doesn't contribute to the energy in the same way as the two V particles, which means that the total energy available for the E particles must be adjusted. This would typically lead to a continuous spectrum with a change in shape due to the different energy distribution, and since the massless particle does not take up energy, it would likely result in an increase in the endpoint energy for the E particles. Therefore, the most fitting choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.",
