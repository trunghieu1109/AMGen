Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction in question is a Diels-Alder reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a cyclohexene derivative. The stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the endo rule, which suggests that the major product will have the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile oriented towards the pi system of the diene in the transition state. The fluorine substituent on the diene will also influence the stereochemistry of the product. Most agents agree that the major product is the one with the endo orientation, which is choice A. Therefore, the final answer is choice A.
