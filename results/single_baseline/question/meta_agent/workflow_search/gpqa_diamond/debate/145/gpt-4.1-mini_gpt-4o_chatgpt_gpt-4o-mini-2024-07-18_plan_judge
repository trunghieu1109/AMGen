Question: Example(question='5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What is the major product?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the endo rule, which suggests that the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (maleic anhydride) will prefer to be in the endo position relative to the diene. The fluorine on the diene will influence the stereochemistry at the 8-position. All agents agree that the major product, considering the endo preference and the influence of the fluorine, corresponds to choice 1. Therefore, the major product is (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.
