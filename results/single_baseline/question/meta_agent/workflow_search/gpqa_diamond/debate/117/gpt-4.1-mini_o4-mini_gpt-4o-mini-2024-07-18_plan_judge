Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and Br2 selectively brominates the Î±-position of the ketone rather than adding across the double bond. This yields 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone as the major product.
