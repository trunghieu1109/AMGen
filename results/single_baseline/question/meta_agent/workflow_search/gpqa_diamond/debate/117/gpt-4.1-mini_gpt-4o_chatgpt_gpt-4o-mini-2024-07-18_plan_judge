Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine involves the addition of bromine across the double bond in the cyclopentene ring. This typically results in the formation of a vicinal dibromide. The addition of bromine to an alkene is known to proceed via an anti-addition mechanism, leading to a trans-dibromo product. The stereochemistry of the product is important, and given the choices, the most likely major product is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which corresponds to a trans addition of bromine across the double bond.
