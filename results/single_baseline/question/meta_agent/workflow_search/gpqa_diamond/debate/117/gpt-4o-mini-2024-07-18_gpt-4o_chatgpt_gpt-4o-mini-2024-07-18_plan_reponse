        "response": "The reaction between an alkene and bromine typically results in the formation of a vicinal dibromide through an anti-addition mechanism. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol has an alkene group that will react with bromine, leading to the formation of a dibromo compound. The anti-addition mechanism results in a trans configuration, which corresponds to the stereochemistry (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). The correct choice reflecting this stereochemistry is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option C.\n\nAnswer:C",
