            "acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.\n\n1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.\n\n3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.\n\nhow many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4? (some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens)",

        "response": "The sequence yields Hell\u2013Volhard\u2013Zelinsky bromination of acetic acid to BrCH2COOH, esterification to ethyl bromoacetate, SN2 with CN to give ethyl cyanoacetate, then deprotonation/alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane and a second deprotonation drives intramolecular cyclization to a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane bearing one nitrile and one ethyl ester. In the cyclohexane product the substituted carbon (C1) has no hydrogens; the five remaining ring carbons are CH2\u2019s. These give three distinct CH2 environments (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4). The single ester substituent gives one OCH2 and one CH3 environment. Ignoring diastereotopic splitting, that is 3 (ring) + 1 (OCH2) + 1 (CH3) = 5 distinct 1H signals.\n\nAnswer:C)",
