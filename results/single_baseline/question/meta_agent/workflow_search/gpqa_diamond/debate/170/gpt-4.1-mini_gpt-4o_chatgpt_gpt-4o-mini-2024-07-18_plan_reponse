        "response": "In electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents on a benzene ring influence the position of substitution. Activating groups like -CH3 and -C2H5 direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups like -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 direct substitution to the meta position. Halogens like -Cl are ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The para-isomer yield is influenced by the strength of activating or deactivating groups. The order of increasing para-isomer yield is determined by the directing effects and activation/deactivation nature of the substituents. The consensus among the agents is that the order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, which aligns with the understanding of the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
