### thinking by Debate Agent XnGL:
We are asked to rank benzene derivatives by increasing weight fraction of the para‐brominated product in an electrophilic substitution (bromination with excess Br2, monobromo only). The para‐fraction depends on the directing effects and steric factors:

Meta‐directors (very low p-yield):
• Nitro (–NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta director; p-yield ≈5%
• Ester (–COOC2H5) is deactivating, meta director; p-yield ≈10%
• Carboxyl (–COOH) is deactivating, meta director; p-yield ≈16%

Ortho/para-directors (higher p-yield):
• Chlorine (–Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para‐directing; nitration data gives p≈30%
• Methyl (–CH3) is activating, ortho/para‐directing; nitration data gives p≈42%
• Ethyl (–C2H5) is similar but slightly bulkier than methyl; steric hindrance raises p-yield slightly, ≈45%

Thus in order of increasing para fraction: 4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5). This matches choice2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6F5t:
We need to rank substituents by their para‐isomer fraction in bromination. Meta-directors give little or no para: strongest deactivator NO₂ gives essentially zero, then ethyl benzoate (–COOEt) slightly more, then benzoic acid (–COOH) even more para (due to hydrogen bonding hindering ortho), so 4&lt;2&lt;6. Among ortho/para directors, weakest deactivator halogen (Cl) gives the lowest para fraction, then toluene (–CH₃), then ethylbenzene (–C₂H₅) gives the highest para due to greater steric hindrance of ortho. So overall: 4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5, which is choice 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent KMfk:
We need to rank the six benzene derivatives by the fraction of para‐brominated product in electrophilic bromination. Meta‐directors (strongly deactivating) give very low para; among them nitro is strongest deactivator (lowest p‐yield), then benzoic acid, then ester. Ortho/para directors give higher para yields; among them methyl gives lowest p‐fraction (~30%), ethyl slightly more (~35%), and chloro (deactivating but o/p director) gives the highest para share (~60%). So increasing p‐yield: 4 (NO2) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5) &lt; 3 (Cl). This corresponds to choice D).

### thinking by Debate Agent pqlz:
We are asked to rank benzene derivatives by the weight fraction of the para‐isomer in their bromination products. Electron‐donating groups favor ortho/para; the stronger the activation and the less steric hindrance at ortho, the more ortho versus para isomers, lowering the para fraction. Conversely, weaker ortho/para directors or deactivators give lower overall para yields. Nitro (–NO₂) is the strongest deactivator and directs mostly meta, so its para yield is nearly zero. Esters (–COOR) and acids (–COOH) are meta directors but less deactivating than –NO₂, so they give small but nonzero para fractions. Chlorine (–Cl) is a weak deactivator but ortho/para director, giving moderate para yield. Alkyl groups (–CH₃, –C₂H₅) are activating ortho/para directors; ethyl is bulkier than methyl, suppressing ortho more and boosting para fraction. Thus the ascending order of para fractions is NO₂ &lt; COOR &lt; COOH &lt; Cl &lt; CH₃ &lt; C₂H₅, which corresponds to choice2.
