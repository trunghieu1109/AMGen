        "response": "We need to rank benzene derivatives by their para\u2010bromination yield. Strong meta\u2010directors give very low para fraction: nitro (\u2013NO\u2082) lowest, followed by ester (\u2013COOC\u2082H\u2085) and carboxyl (\u2013COOH) giving small p\u2010yields. Among ortho/para directors, chlorine (\u2013Cl) gives moderate p\u2010yield, methyl (\u2013CH\u2083) higher, and ethyl (\u2013C\u2082H\u2085) highest due to greater ortho steric hindrance. Thus increasing para fraction: 4 (NO\u2082) < 2 (COOC\u2082H\u2085) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH\u2083) < 5 (C\u2082H\u2085), matching choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
