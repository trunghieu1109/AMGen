Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need to rank benzene derivatives by their para‐bromination yield. Strong meta‐directors give very low para fraction: nitro (–NO₂) lowest, followed by ester (–COOC₂H₅) and carboxyl (–COOH) giving small p‐yields. Among ortho/para directors, chlorine (–Cl) gives moderate p‐yield, methyl (–CH₃) higher, and ethyl (–C₂H₅) highest due to greater ortho steric hindrance. Thus increasing para fraction: 4 (NO₂) < 2 (COOC₂H₅) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH₃) < 5 (C₂H₅), matching choice 2.
