        "response": "In electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring determine the position of substitution. Activating groups like alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para-directing and increase the yield of para-isomers. Deactivating groups like -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 are meta-directing and reduce the yield of para-isomers. Halogens (e.g., -Cl) are ortho/para-directing but are deactivating, so they have a moderate effect. Evaluating each substituent: 1) -CH3 is an EDG, high para-yield. 2) -COOC2H5 is an EWG, low para-yield. 3) -Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director, moderate para-yield. 4) -NO2 is a strong EWG, low para-yield. 5) -C2H5 is an EDG, high para-yield. 6) -COOH is an EWG, low para-yield. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para-yield is based on the strength of the directing effects. All agents agree on the order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
