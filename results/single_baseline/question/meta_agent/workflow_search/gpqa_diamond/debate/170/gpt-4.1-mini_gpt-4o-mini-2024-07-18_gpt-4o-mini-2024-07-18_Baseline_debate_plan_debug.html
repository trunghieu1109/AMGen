### thinking by Debate Agent Mfkp:
To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) generally direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct substitution to the meta position. The strength of these effects will influence the yield of para-isomers. In this case, we have: 1) Methyl (EDG) promotes para and ortho substitution. 2) Ethoxy (EDG) promotes para and ortho substitution. 3) Chloro (weak EWG) has a moderate para yield. 4) Nitro (strong EWG) favors meta substitution, thus low para yield. 5) Ethyl (EDG) promotes para and ortho substitution. 6) Carboxylic acid (EWG) also favors meta, thus low para yield. The order of increasing weight fraction of para isomers based on these effects would be: 4 (Nitro) &lt; 6 (Carboxylic acid) &lt; 2 (Ethoxy) &lt; 3 (Chloro) &lt; 1 (Methyl) &lt; 5 (Ethyl). Thus the correct choice is 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5.

In electrophilic substitution reactions, the position of substitution on the benzene ring can be influenced by the substituents already present on the ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) tend to direct electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct them to the meta position. To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we consider the nature of the substituents: 

1) ะก6H5-CH3 (methyl group, EDG) - directs to ortho and para. 
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethoxy group, EDG) - directs to ortho and para. 
3) C6H5-Cl (chloro group, weakly EWG) - directs to ortho and para. 
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro group, EWG) - directs to meta. 
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group, EDG) - directs to ortho and para. 
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid, EWG) - directs to meta. 

Thus, the substances that can form para isomers (1, 2, 3, 5) will have higher yields of para compared to those that direct to meta (4, 6). The order of increasing yield of para-isomer is influenced by the strength of the EDGs and EWGs. Based on this reasoning, the correct order is choice 3: 6&lt;2&lt;4&lt;5&lt;1&lt;3.

### thinking by Debate Agent j1lB:
To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) will direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) will direct it to the meta position. Thus, we analyze each compound:

1. C6H5-CH3 (methyl group) - EDG, favors para and ortho.
2. C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethoxy group) - EDG, favors para and ortho.
3. C6H5-Cl (chloro group) - EWG, prefers ortho and para but less so than EDGs.
4. C6H5-NO2 (nitro group) - EWG, directs to meta, very low yield of para.
5. C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group) - EDG, favors para and ortho.
6. C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid) - EWG, directs to meta, low yield of para.

Based on these analyses, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is likely influenced heavily by the strength of the electron-donating or withdrawing effect of each substituent. The compounds with EDGs will yield more para isomers than those with EWGs. Therefore, the expected order is:

4 (NO2, very low yield) &lt; 6 (COOH, low yield) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5, moderate yield) &lt; 1 (CH3, higher yield) &lt; 5 (C2H5, similar to CH3) &lt; 3 (Cl, lower yield than the EDGs). This reasoning aligns with the choice 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3.

### thinking by Debate Agent fXqP:
To determine the order of the substances based on the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) will favor the para position more than the ortho, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) will direct substitution to the meta position. The order of the substituents in terms of their ability to stabilize the positive charge on the carbocation intermediate formed during the electrophilic substitution will affect the yield of the para-isomer. After analyzing the substituents: 1) -CH3 (EDG), 2) -COOC2H5 (EDG), 3) -Cl (weak EWG), 4) -NO2 (strong EWG), 5) -C2H5 (EDG), 6) -COOH (weak EWG), we conclude that the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is influenced by the strength of the electron-donating or withdrawing effects. The final arrangement based on these effects is 4 &lt; 6 &lt; 2 &lt; 1 &lt; 5 &lt; 3.
