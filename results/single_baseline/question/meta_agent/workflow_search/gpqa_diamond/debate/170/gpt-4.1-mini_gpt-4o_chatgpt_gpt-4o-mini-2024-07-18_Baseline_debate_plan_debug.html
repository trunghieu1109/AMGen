### thinking by Debate Agent XnGL:
In an electrophilic substitution reaction, the directing effects of substituents on a benzene ring influence the position of substitution. Activating groups like -CH3 and -C2H5 direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups like -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 direct substitution to the meta position. Halogens like -Cl are ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The para-isomer yield is influenced by the strength of activating or deactivating groups. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is determined by the directing effects and activation/deactivation nature of the substituents.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6F5t:
To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions and increase the yield of the para-isomer. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct the electrophile to the meta position and decrease the yield of the para-isomer. The substituents in the given substances are: 1) CH3 - an EDG, 2) COOC2H5 - an EWG, 3) Cl - an EDG but with moderate directing effect, 4) NO2 - a strong EWG, 5) C2H5 - an EDG, 6) COOH - an EWG. The order of increasing para-isomer yield will be based on the strength of these directing effects.

### thinking by Debate Agent KMfk:
In electrophilic substitution reactions, the position of substitution on the benzene ring is influenced by the nature of the substituents already present on the ring. Activating groups such as alkyl groups and halogens direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups like nitro and carboxyl groups direct it to the meta position. The weight fraction of the para-isomer will be higher for substituents that preferentially direct substitution to the para position. 

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) - The methyl group is an activating group, directing to ortho/para positions. Para isomer is significant. 
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) - The ester group is deactivating, but less so than nitro or carboxyl, directing to meta, but some para product forms.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) - The chlorine is weakly deactivating but directs to ortho/para. Para isomer is significant.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) - The nitro group is strongly deactivating, directing to meta. Minimal para product forms.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) - Similar to toluene, the ethyl group is activating, directing to ortho/para. Para isomer is significant.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) - The carboxyl group is strongly deactivating, directing to meta. Minimal para product forms.

Based on this, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is likely to be influenced by the degree of activation/deactivation and the directing effects of the groups.

4 (nitro, minimal para) &lt; 6 (carboxyl, minimal para) &lt; 2 (ester, some para) &lt; 1 (methyl, significant para) &lt; 5 (ethyl, significant para) &lt; 3 (chloro, significant para)

### thinking by Debate Agent pqlz:
In electrophilic substitution reactions involving benzene rings, the position of substitution (ortho, meta, or para) depends on the nature of the substituents already on the ring. Activating groups, such as alkyl groups, direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups, such as nitro groups, direct them to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be higher when the substituent is an ortho/para director. 

1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene) has a methyl group, which is an activating ortho/para director.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate) has an ester group, which is a deactivating meta director.
3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene) has a chlorine atom, which is a deactivating ortho/para director.
4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene) has a nitro group, which is a strongly deactivating meta director.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene) has an ethyl group, which is an activating ortho/para director.
6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid) has a carboxylic acid group, which is a deactivating meta director.

Based on this, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is determined by the strength of the directing effects:
- Strongest meta directors (lowest para yield): Nitro (4), Ester (2), Carboxylic acid (6)
- Weaker meta directors: Chlorine (3)
- Weakest ortho/para directors: Methyl (1), Ethyl (5)

Thus, the order is 4 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 3 &lt; 1 &lt; 5.
