Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Retroviruses carry RNA genomes, so direct DNA sequencing (choice A) isnâ€™t possible. Antibody detection (choice B) is indirect and may miss early infections. Symptom-guided nested PCR (choice C) lacks specificity and is more time-consuming. The optimal approach is to extract viral RNA, reverse-transcribe it into cDNA, sequence the cDNA to design specific primers, and then develop a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection.
