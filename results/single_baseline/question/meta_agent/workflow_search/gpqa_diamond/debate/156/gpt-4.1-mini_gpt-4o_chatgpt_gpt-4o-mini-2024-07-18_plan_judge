Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the best approach to designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus involves identifying the virus by sequencing its cDNA. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so reverse transcription is necessary to convert the RNA into cDNA. Once the cDNA is sequenced, a real-time PCR kit can be developed for quick and accurate detection of the virus. This method is both sensitive and specific for detecting viral RNA, making it the most appropriate choice among the options provided.
