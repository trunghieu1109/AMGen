            "There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?",
            "First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis",
            "First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.",
            "First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.",
            "First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.",

        "response": "Retroviruses carry RNA genomes, so direct DNA sequencing (choice A) isn\u2019t possible. Antibody detection (choice B) is indirect and may miss early infections. Symptom-guided nested PCR (choice C) lacks specificity and is more time-consuming. The optimal approach is to extract viral RNA, reverse-transcribe it into cDNA, sequence the cDNA to design specific primers, and then develop a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection.\n\nAnswer:D)",
