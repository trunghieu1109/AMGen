Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, it is essential to identify the viral RNA, as retroviruses have RNA genomes. The best approach involves converting this RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and then using real-time PCR for detection. This method allows for rapid and specific amplification of the viral genetic material, making it suitable for quick diagnosis. Therefore, the option that specifies cDNA sequencing followed by real-time PCR is the most appropriate choice.
