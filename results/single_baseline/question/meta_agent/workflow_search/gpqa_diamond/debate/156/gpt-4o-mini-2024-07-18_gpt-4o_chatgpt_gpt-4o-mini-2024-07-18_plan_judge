Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the most effective approach to designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus involves focusing on the viral genetic material. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, which need to be reverse transcribed into cDNA for sequencing. This allows for the identification of specific genetic markers of the virus. Once these markers are identified, a real-time PCR kit can be developed for rapid and accurate detection. This method is specific to the viral genetic material and allows for precise diagnosis. The other options, such as identifying IgG antibodies or using symptoms for identification, are less direct and not as suitable for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus. Therefore, the best choice is to perform cDNA sequencing and develop a real-time PCR kit.
