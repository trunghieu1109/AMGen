        "response": "To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: \u0394x * \u0394p \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0394x is the uncertainty in position and \u0394p is the uncertainty in momentum. Given \u0394x = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m, we calculate \u0394p using \u0394p = \u0127/(2\u0394x). The reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s. Thus, \u0394p = 1.0545718 x 10^-34 / (2 * 0.1 x 10^-9) = 5.272859 x 10^-25 kg\u00b7m/s. The uncertainty in energy \u0394E can be related to \u0394p by \u0394E = \u0394p * v, where v = 2 x 10^8 m/s. Therefore, \u0394E = 5.272859 x 10^-25 * 2 x 10^8 = 1.0545718 x 10^-16 J. Comparing this with the given choices, the closest match is choice D) ~10^(-17) J.\n\nAnswer:D)",
