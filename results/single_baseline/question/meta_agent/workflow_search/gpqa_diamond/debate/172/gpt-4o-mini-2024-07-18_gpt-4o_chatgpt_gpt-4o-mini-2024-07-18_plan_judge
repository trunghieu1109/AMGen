Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m, we calculate Δp using Δp = ħ/(2Δx). The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s. Thus, Δp = 1.0545718 x 10^-34 / (2 * 0.1 x 10^-9) = 5.272859 x 10^-25 kg·m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be related to Δp by ΔE = Δp * v, where v = 2 x 10^8 m/s. Therefore, ΔE = 5.272859 x 10^-25 * 2 x 10^8 = 1.0545718 x 10^-16 J. Comparing this with the given choices, the closest match is choice D) ~10^(-17) J.
