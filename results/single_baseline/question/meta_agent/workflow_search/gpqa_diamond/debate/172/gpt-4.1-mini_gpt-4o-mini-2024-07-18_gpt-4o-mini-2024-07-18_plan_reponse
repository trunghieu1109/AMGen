        "response": "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \u0394E of the electron, we apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: \u0394x * \u0394p \u2265 \u0127/2. Given \u0394x = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^(-9) m, we can calculate \u0394p using \u0394p = \u0127/(2\u0394x). The reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.055 x 10^(-34) Js. After calculating \u0394p, we can find \u0394E using the relation \u0394E = \u0394p * v, where v = 2 * 10^8 m/s. Performing these calculations leads us to an estimate for \u0394E, which we then compare to the provided choices to find the closest match.\n\nAnswer:B)",
