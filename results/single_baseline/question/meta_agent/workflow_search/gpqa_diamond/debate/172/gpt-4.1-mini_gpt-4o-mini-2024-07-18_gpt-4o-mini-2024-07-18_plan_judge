Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^(-9) m, we can calculate Δp using Δp = ħ/(2Δx). The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.055 x 10^(-34) Js. After calculating Δp, we can find ΔE using the relation ΔE = Δp * v, where v = 2 * 10^8 m/s. Performing these calculations leads us to an estimate for ΔE, which we then compare to the provided choices to find the closest match.
