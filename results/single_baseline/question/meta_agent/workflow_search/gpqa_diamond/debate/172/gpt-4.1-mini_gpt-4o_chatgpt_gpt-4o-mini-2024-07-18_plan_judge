Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, we calculate Δp as Δp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx) = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) / (2 * 0.1 × 10^(-9)) = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum by ΔE = Δp * v, where v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. Thus, ΔE = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) * 2 × 10^8 = 1.0545718 × 10^(-16) J. The closest choice to this calculated value is choice 3, which is ~10^(-16) J.
