### thinking by Debate Agent RnTY:
To determine optical activity, we need to identify compounds with chiral centers that are not superimposable on their mirror images. 
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound has no chiral centers, so it is not optically active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers (3aR and 7aS), so it is optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound is a meso compound due to internal symmetry, so it is not optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has chiral centers and is optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has a chiral center and is optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has chiral centers and is optically active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound has no chiral centers, so it is not optically active.
Thus, 4 compounds are optically active.

### thinking by Debate Agent VvKM:
Optical activity is exhibited by chiral molecules, which do not have a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images. Let&#39;s analyze each compound:
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound does not have a chiral center as the (Z) configuration implies symmetry.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound is complex, but the presence of chiral centers suggests it could be optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers and is not meso, hence it is optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has a chiral center and is optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound has a chiral center and is optically active.
After analysis, the optically active compounds are: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, and 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3gZG:
To determine optical activity, we need to check if each compound has a chiral center or lacks a plane of symmetry. 

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound has no chiral center as the double bond restricts rotation and does not create a chiral configuration. 
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers at 3a and 7a, so it can be optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers but is a meso compound due to its internal plane of symmetry, so it is not optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers and is optically active as it is not meso.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, making it optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has symmetry and is not optically active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the methyl group, making it optically active.

Therefore, the optically active compounds are: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, and 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

### thinking by Debate Agent wCan:
To determine optical activity, we need to check if the compounds have chiral centers and lack a plane of symmetry.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center, not optically active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Has chiral centers, but needs further analysis for symmetry. Likely optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Has chiral centers, is a meso compound, not optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Has chiral centers and is optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center and is optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Has chiral centers but is symmetrical, not optically active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral center, not optically active.

Optically active compounds: 2, 4, and 5.
