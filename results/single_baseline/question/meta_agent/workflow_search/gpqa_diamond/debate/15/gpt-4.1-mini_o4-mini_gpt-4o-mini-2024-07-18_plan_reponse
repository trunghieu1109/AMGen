(3aR,7aS,E)-bicyclic chloromethylene dione: two fixed stereocenters, no meso \u2192 chiral.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,S on a symmetric diacid \u2192 meso, achiral.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: enantiomeric pair \u2192 chiral.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on an unsymmetrical ring \u2192 chiral.\n6.
