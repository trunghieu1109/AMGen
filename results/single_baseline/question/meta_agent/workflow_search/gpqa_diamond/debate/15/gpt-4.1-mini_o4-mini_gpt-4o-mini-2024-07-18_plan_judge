Question: Example(question='How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one', choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We evaluate each compound for chiral stereocenters and absence of internal symmetry:
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no sp³ stereocenter → achiral.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-bicyclic chloromethylene dione: two fixed stereocenters, no meso → chiral.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,S on a symmetric diacid → meso, achiral.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: enantiomeric pair → chiral.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on an unsymmetrical ring → chiral.
6. (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters with D3 symmetry and no mirror → chiral.
7. 1-Cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one sp³ center with three different substituents → chiral.
Thus compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are optically active, total = 5.
