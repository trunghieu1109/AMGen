(R)-Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on a non‐symmetric ring → active.\n6. (1S,3S,5S)-Cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters in a cis, alternating pattern; no mirror plane → active.\n7. 1-Cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: the potential stereocenter has two identical methyl substituents → inactive.\n\nActive compounds are #2, #4, #5, and #6 → total = 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 3gZG:\nWe need count of optically active (chiral, non-meso) molecules among the seven.\n1.

(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one resolved stereocenter in a non-symmetric ring → chiral.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: each center assigned, but rapid ring flip inverts all centers → racemizes, achiral overall.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one sp³ C (C3) bearing three different groups → chiral.\nChiral: #2, #4, #5, #7 → four compounds.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent wCan:\nFirst, identify stereocenters and symmetry for each compound:\n\n1.
