        "response": "After analyzing the compounds for chiral centers, I found that the following compounds exhibit optical activity: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, and 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The compound (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound and does not exhibit optical activity. The compound (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is also symmetric and does not exhibit optical activity. Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is 4.\n\nAnswer:4",
