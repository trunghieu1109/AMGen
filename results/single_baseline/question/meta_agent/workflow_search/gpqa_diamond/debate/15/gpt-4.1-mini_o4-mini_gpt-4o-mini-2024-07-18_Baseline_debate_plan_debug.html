### thinking by Debate Agent RnTY:
We need to count how many of the seven given compounds are chiral (i.e., have stereocenters and no internal symmetry making them meso):

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no stereocenters → achiral.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: two stereocenters (R,S) and an E double bond, no internal mirror plane → chiral.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,S pair in a symmetrical molecule → meso, achiral.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: enantiomeric form → chiral.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter, unsymmetrical ring → chiral.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters (all S), no meso possibility → chiral.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one stereocenter at C-3 → chiral.

Chiral compounds: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 → total = 5.

### thinking by Debate Agent VvKM:
We need to count which of the seven compounds are chiral and thus optically active (assuming enantiomerically pure and that meso forms and identical‐substituent cases are inactive).

1. (Z)-1-Chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no stereocenter → inactive.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-bicyclic chloromethylene dione: two stereocenters with fixed configuration, no internal symmetry → active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-Dimethylsuccinic acid: R,S is meso → inactive.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-Dimethylsuccinic acid: enantiomerically pure diastereomer with two identical configurations → active.
5. (R)-Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on a non‐symmetric ring → active.
6. (1S,3S,5S)-Cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters in a cis, alternating pattern; no mirror plane → active.
7. 1-Cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: the potential stereocenter has two identical methyl substituents → inactive.

Active compounds are #2, #4, #5, and #6 → total = 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3gZG:
We need count of optically active (chiral, non-meso) molecules among the seven.
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: planar alkene, no sp³ stereocenter → achiral.
2. Bicyclic (3aR,7aS,E)… with two non-equivalent stereocenters specified → chiral.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: opposite configurations on symmetrical diacid → meso, achiral.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: both same → enantiomeric, chiral.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one resolved stereocenter in a non-symmetric ring → chiral.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: each center assigned, but rapid ring flip inverts all centers → racemizes, achiral overall.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one sp³ C (C3) bearing three different groups → chiral.
Chiral: #2, #4, #5, #7 → four compounds.

### thinking by Debate Agent wCan:
First, identify stereocenters and symmetry for each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no stereocenter → achiral.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: two stereocenters, no internal mirror → chiral.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso (internal mirror) → achiral.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: pair of like stereocenters → chiral.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter, no mirror → chiral.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters, no internal mirror relates S to R → chiral.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one stereocenter at C-3 → chiral.

Chiral (optically active) are 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 → total 5.

    <pre>We evaluate each compound for chiral stereocenters and absence of internal symmetry:
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no sp³ stereocenter → achiral.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-bicyclic chloromethylene dione: two fixed stereocenters, no meso → chiral.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: R,S on a symmetric diacid → meso, achiral.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: enantiomeric pair → chiral.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter on an unsymmetrical ring → chiral.
6. (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters with D3 symmetry and no mirror → chiral.
7. 1-Cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one sp³ center with three different substituents → chiral.
Thus compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are optically active, total = 5.
