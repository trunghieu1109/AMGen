            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "As N\u2192\u221e the N\u2010sided polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far\u2010field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, whose minima occur at zeros of the first\u2010order Bessel function J\u2081. The first two zeros are x\u2081\u22483.8317 and x\u2082\u22487.0156, satisfying k\u2009a\u2009\u03b8_n=x_n with k=2\u03c0/\u03bb. Hence \u03b8\u2081=(3.8317\u2009\u03bb)/(2\u03c0\u2009a)\u22480.610\u2009\u03bb/a and \u03b8\u2082=(7.0156\u2009\u03bb)/(2\u03c0\u2009a)\u22481.117\u2009\u03bb/a. Their separation is \u0394\u03b8=\u03b8\u2082\u2212\u03b8\u2081\u2248(7.0156\u22123.8317)\u03bb/(2\u03c0\u2009a)\u22480.506\u2009\u03bb/a.\n\nAnswer:D",
