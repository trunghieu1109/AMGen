Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: As N→∞ the N‐sided polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, whose minima occur at zeros of the first‐order Bessel function J₁. The first two zeros are x₁≈3.8317 and x₂≈7.0156, satisfying k a θ_n=x_n with k=2π/λ. Hence θ₁=(3.8317 λ)/(2π a)≈0.610 λ/a and θ₂=(7.0156 λ)/(2π a)≈1.117 λ/a. Their separation is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁≈(7.0156−3.8317)λ/(2π a)≈0.506 λ/a.
