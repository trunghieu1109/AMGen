    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 1k94:
As N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The dark rings occur at zeros of J1, whose first two zeros are x1≈3.8317 and x2≈7.0156. For small angles k a θ = x_n with k=2π/λ gives θ_n = x_n λ/(2π a). Thus θ1=3.8317 λ/(2π a)=0.6103 λ/a and θ2=7.0156 λ/(2π a)=1.1169 λ/a. The angular separation Δθ=θ2−θ1≈0.5066 λ/a, corresponding to choice D.

### thinking by Debate Agent fVP1:
As N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular disk of radius a. The diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, with minima given by zeros of J1. The first zero occurs at angle θ1 satisfying sinθ1≈1.22λ/D, where D=2a, so θ1≈0.61λ/a. The second zero is at sinθ2≈2.233λ/D≈1.1165λ/a, so θ2≈1.1165λ/a. The angular separation is θ2−θ1≈(1.1165−0.61)λ/a≈0.5065λ/a. Hence the closest choice is 0.506λ/a, option D).

### thinking by Debate Agent EtXT:
As N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with minima at angles given by zeros of J1(x): x_n=2πaθ_n/λ. The first two zeros are x1≈3.8317 and x2≈7.0156, so θ1=(3.8317 λ)/(2πa)≈0.610 λ/a and θ2=(7.0156 λ)/(2πa)≈1.116 λ/a. The angular distance between these two minima is θ2–θ1≈(7.0156–3.8317)λ/(2πa)=0.506 λ/a.

### thinking by Debate Agent H9VE:
As N→∞, the regular N‐gon becomes a circular aperture of radius a (the apothem→radius). The far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, whose first two zeros occur at k a θ = x1 ≈3.8317 and x2 ≈7.0156 (k=2π/λ), so θ1=x1/(2π)(λ/a)≈0.610λ/a and θ2=x2/(2π)(λ/a). The angular separation between these minima is Δθ=(x2−x1)/(2π)(λ/a)≈(7.0156−3.8317)/(2π)(λ/a)=0.506λ/a, matching choice 4.

    <pre>As N→∞ the N‐sided polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, whose minima occur at zeros of the first‐order Bessel function J₁. The first two zeros are x₁≈3.8317 and x₂≈7.0156, satisfying k a θ_n=x_n with k=2π/λ. Hence θ₁=(3.8317 λ)/(2π a)≈0.610 λ/a and θ₂=(7.0156 λ)/(2π a)≈1.117 λ/a. Their separation is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁≈(7.0156−3.8317)λ/(2π a)≈0.506 λ/a.
