Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves diffraction through an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with an infinite number of sides, effectively making it a circle. The apothems become the radius of the circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk pattern, with the first minimum appearing at an angle θ given by the formula θ = 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter of the circle. Since the apothem is a, the diameter D is 2a. Therefore, the angular distance to the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.610 λ/a. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the same as the angle to the first minimum in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.610 λ/a.
