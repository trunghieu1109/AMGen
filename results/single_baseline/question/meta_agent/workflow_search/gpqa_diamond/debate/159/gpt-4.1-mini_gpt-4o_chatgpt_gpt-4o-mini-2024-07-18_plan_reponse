            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon approaches the shape of a circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern in the far field is described by the Airy pattern. The first minimum in the Airy pattern occurs at an angle given by 1.22 * lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. In this case, the apothem a is related to the radius of the circle, and for a large N-sided polygon, a approximates the radius. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is determined by the first minimum formula for a circular aperture, which is 1.220 * lambda / a.\n\nAnswer:A)",
