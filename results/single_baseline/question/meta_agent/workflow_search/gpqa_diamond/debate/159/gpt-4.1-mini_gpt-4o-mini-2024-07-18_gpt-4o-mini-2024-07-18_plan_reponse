            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon approximates a circular aperture. The angular position of the minima in the diffraction pattern can be derived from the formula for the first minima, which is given by sin(theta) = m * lambda / a, where m is the order of the minima. For small angles, sin(theta) can be approximated as theta. The first minimum occurs at m=1, thus theta = lambda / a. The second minimum occurs at m=2, thus theta = 2 * lambda / a. The angular distance between the first two minima is then the difference between these two angles, which is (2 * lambda / a) - (lambda / a) = lambda / a. However, the spacing between the first two minima is typically found to be 0.610 * lambda / a in this situation. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2, which corresponds to 0.610 lambda / a.\n\nAnswer:B",
