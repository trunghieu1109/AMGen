Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All the debate agents have analyzed the issues listed and concluded that each of them is a common source of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The issues include mutually incompatible data formats, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. Since all these issues are known to cause errors, the most comprehensive choice is the one that includes all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All of the above'.
