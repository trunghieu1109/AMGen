Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Mutually incompatible data formats typically cause immediate failures or clear errors, whereas chromosome prefix mismatches ("chr"/"no chr"), reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions can silently introduce erroneous results that are hard to spot.
