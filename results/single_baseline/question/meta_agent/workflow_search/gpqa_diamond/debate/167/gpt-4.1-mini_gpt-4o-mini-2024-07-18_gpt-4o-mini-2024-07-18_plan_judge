Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: After analyzing the various perspectives on the common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, it is clear that the confusion between 'chr' and 'no chr', reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions are significant contributors to errors that are often hard to detect. While mutually incompatible data formats can also cause issues, they are generally more identifiable. Therefore, the most comprehensive choice that encompasses the most common sources of errors is '2, 3 and 4'.
