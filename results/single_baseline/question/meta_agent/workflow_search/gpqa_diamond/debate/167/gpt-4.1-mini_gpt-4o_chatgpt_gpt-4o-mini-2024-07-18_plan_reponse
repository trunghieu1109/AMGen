The issues include mutually incompatible data formats, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. Since all these issues are known to cause errors, the most comprehensive choice is the one that includes all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All of the above'.\n\nAnswer:C)",
