For τ1 = 10^-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 = 1.054×10^-34 J·s / 10^-9 s = 1.054×10^-25 J ≈ 6.6×10^-7 eV. For τ2 = 10^-8 s: ΔE2 ≈ 6.6×10^-8 eV. Even if we take the larger width (~6.6×10^-7 eV), the chosen energy difference must be significantly larger to clearly resolve the lines. Among the options, only 10^-4 eV greatly exceeds this value. Therefore the correct choice is D).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tpUs:\nThe energy uncertainty ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. For τ1=10^-9 s, ΔE1≈6.6×10^-16 eV·s /10^-9 s≈6.6×10^-7 eV; for τ2=10^-8 s, ΔE2≈6.6×10^-8 eV. To resolve the two levels, ΔE = |E2–E1| must exceed these uncertainties (≈10^-7 eV). Among the choices, only 10^-4 eV is significantly larger than 10^-7 eV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Acib:\nAccording to the energy–time uncertainty principle, ΔE≈ħ/τ. For τ=10⁻⁹\u2009s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV; for τ=10⁻⁸\u2009s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁸\u2009eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference must exceed these broadenings (≫10⁻⁶\u2009eV). Of the choices, only 10⁻⁴\u2009eV satisfies this.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eeAI:\nWe use the energy–time uncertainty principle: ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. For Δt=10⁻⁹ s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s / 10⁻⁹ s = 6.6×10⁻⁷ eV, and for Δt=10⁻⁸ s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. To resolve the two levels, their energy separation must exceed both widths (~10⁻⁷ eV). Among the choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV » 10⁻⁷ eV meets this.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent j36X:\nD\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tpUs:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Acib:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eeAI:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
