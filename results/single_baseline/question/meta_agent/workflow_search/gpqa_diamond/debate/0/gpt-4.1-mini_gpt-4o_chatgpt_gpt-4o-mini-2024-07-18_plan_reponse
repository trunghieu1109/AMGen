        "response": "To resolve two quantum states with different lifetimes, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle: \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. The state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) will have a larger energy uncertainty, which determines the minimum resolvable energy difference. Calculating this gives \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2 * 10^-9) = 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. The energy difference must be greater than this value to clearly resolve the states. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV.\n\nAnswer:D)",
