Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To distinguish between two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy difference, Δt is the lifetime, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV·s). For the state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 s), the minimum energy difference required for resolution would be ΔE ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-9 s) ≈ 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than this to resolve the states. Among the given options, 10^-4 eV is the only value greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV, which means it is the only option that allows the energy levels to be clearly resolved.
