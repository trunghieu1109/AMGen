Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To clearly distinguish between two quantum states, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is determined by the lifetimes of the states. The shorter lifetime of 10^-9 sec gives a larger uncertainty in energy, which can be calculated using the energy-time uncertainty principle. The uncertainty for the state with a lifetime of 10^-9 sec is approximately 10^-9 eV. Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels clearly, the energy difference must be greater than this uncertainty. Among the options provided, 10^-8 eV is equal to the uncertainty for the longer lifetime and does not provide clear resolution, while 10^-4 eV is significantly larger than the uncertainty, making it the best choice for clear resolution. Thus, the correct answer is D) 10^-4 eV.
