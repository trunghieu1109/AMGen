Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To resolve two quantum states with different lifetimes, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. The state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) will have a larger energy uncertainty, which determines the minimum resolvable energy difference. Calculating this gives ΔE ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-9) = 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. The energy difference must be greater than this value to clearly resolve the states. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV.
