Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The energy–time uncertainty gives level broadening ΔE ≈ ħ/τ: for τ=10⁻⁹ s ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV, for τ=10⁻⁸ s ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference must exceed these widths (~10⁻⁷ eV). Among the options only 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger.
