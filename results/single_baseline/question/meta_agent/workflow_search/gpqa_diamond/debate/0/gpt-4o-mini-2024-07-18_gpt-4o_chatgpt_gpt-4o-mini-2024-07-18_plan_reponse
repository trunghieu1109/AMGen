        "response": "To distinguish between two quantum states with different energies, we need to consider the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the energy difference, \u0394t is the lifetime, and \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV\u00b7s). For the state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 s), the minimum energy difference required for resolution would be \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2 * 10^-9 s) \u2248 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than this to resolve the states. Among the given options, 10^-4 eV is the only value greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV, which means it is the only option that allows the energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\nAnswer:D)",
