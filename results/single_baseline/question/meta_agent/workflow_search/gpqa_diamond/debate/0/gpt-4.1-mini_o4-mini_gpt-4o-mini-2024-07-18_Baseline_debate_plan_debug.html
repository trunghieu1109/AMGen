    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;10^-4 eV&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent j36X:
To resolve two quantum states their energy difference ΔE must exceed the uncertainty broadening given by ħ/τ. For τ1 = 10^-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 = 1.054×10^-34 J·s / 10^-9 s = 1.054×10^-25 J ≈ 6.6×10^-7 eV. For τ2 = 10^-8 s: ΔE2 ≈ 6.6×10^-8 eV. Even if we take the larger width (~6.6×10^-7 eV), the chosen energy difference must be significantly larger to clearly resolve the lines. Among the options, only 10^-4 eV greatly exceeds this value. Therefore the correct choice is D).

### thinking by Debate Agent tpUs:
The energy uncertainty ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. For τ1=10^-9 s, ΔE1≈6.6×10^-16 eV·s /10^-9 s≈6.6×10^-7 eV; for τ2=10^-8 s, ΔE2≈6.6×10^-8 eV. To resolve the two levels, ΔE = |E2–E1| must exceed these uncertainties (≈10^-7 eV). Among the choices, only 10^-4 eV is significantly larger than 10^-7 eV.

### thinking by Debate Agent Acib:
According to the energy–time uncertainty principle, ΔE≈ħ/τ. For τ=10⁻⁹ s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV; for τ=10⁻⁸ s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference must exceed these broadenings (≫10⁻⁶ eV). Of the choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this.

### thinking by Debate Agent eeAI:
We use the energy–time uncertainty principle: ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. For Δt=10⁻⁹ s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s / 10⁻⁹ s = 6.6×10⁻⁷ eV, and for Δt=10⁻⁸ s, ΔE≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. To resolve the two levels, their energy separation must exceed both widths (~10⁻⁷ eV). Among the choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV » 10⁻⁷ eV meets this.
