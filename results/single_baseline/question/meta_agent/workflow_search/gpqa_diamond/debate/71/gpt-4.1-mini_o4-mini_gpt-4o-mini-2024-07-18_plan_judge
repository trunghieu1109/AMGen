Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The sequence builds a naphthalene core which has eight total hydrogens but only four symmetry‐unique proton environments (H‐1/8, H‐2/7, H‐3/6, H‐4/5). Therefore there are 4 chemically distinct hydrogens.

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 4
