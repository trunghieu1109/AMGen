Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: After analyzing the reactions and the structure of the final product 4, it is determined that the transformations do not significantly alter the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. The reactions involve the addition of functional groups and potential rearrangements, but the final count of distinct hydrogen atoms remains consistent. The consensus from the analysis indicates that there are 8 distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 4
