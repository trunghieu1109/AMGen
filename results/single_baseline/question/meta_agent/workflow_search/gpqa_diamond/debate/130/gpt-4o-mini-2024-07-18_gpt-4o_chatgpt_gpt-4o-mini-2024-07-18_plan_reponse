            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",

        "response": "The problem involves interpreting NMR data to determine which resonances are connected by a cross-peak in a 2D NOESY NMR spectrum. The NOESY experiment reveals spatial proximity between non-bonded hydrogen atoms. The major product has a cross-peak that indicates two proton environments are close in space. Given the choices, we need to identify the pair of proton signals that would likely exhibit a NOESY cross-peak due to spatial proximity. A singlet suggests equivalent protons, while a doublet indicates coupling with a nearby proton. The cross-peak is likely between protons in close spatial proximity, possibly on adjacent carbons or within the same functional group. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm suggest proximity between methyl groups and a methylene group, which is plausible for a major product of a Diels-Alder reaction. Other choices either involve less likely spatial arrangements or don't match typical chemical shifts for such proximity.\n\nAnswer:A)",
