Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The Diels–Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene gives endo (major) and exo (minor) bicyclic anhydride adducts. In the endo isomer, the four methyl groups split into two equivalent sets (6 H each), one set oriented syn to the anhydride carbonyls and close in space to the bridge CH2 protons (2 H) that appear around 3.5 ppm. This proximity leads to a NOESY cross-peak between the 6 H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (endo Me’s) and the 2 H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The exo isomer lacks this spatial proximity, so no cross-peak is observed.
