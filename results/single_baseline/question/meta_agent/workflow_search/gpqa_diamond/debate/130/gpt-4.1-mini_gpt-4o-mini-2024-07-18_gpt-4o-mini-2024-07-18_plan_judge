Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product, we need to consider the nature of the cross-peaks in NOESY. These indicate spatial proximity between protons. The presence of a cross-peak suggests that the two protons are close enough in space to interact, which is typically seen in protons on adjacent atoms or in a conformationally favorable arrangement. The major product likely has a specific arrangement that allows for this interaction, while the minor product does not. Given the choices, the singlet at ~1.7 ppm could correspond to protons that are in a favorable spatial arrangement with the singlet at ~3.5 ppm, making them a likely pair for the cross-peak. Therefore, the best choice is the first one, which includes a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.
