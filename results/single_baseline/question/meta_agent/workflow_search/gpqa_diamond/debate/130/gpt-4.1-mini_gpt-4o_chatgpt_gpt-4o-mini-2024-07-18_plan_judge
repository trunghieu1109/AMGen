Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves identifying which pair of proton resonances in the major product's 1H NMR spectrum are connected by a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum, indicating spatial proximity. The major product is formed from a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid-derived anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, likely through a Diels-Alder reaction. The NOESY cross-peak suggests that the protons are close in space, typically due to being on adjacent carbons or within the same molecular plane. The choices describe different proton environments with specific chemical shifts and integrals. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are likely due to protons on methyl groups and a methylene group, respectively, in close proximity, which is consistent with the expected chemical shifts and integrals for such a structure. Therefore, the correct choice is the one indicating such a spatial relationship.
