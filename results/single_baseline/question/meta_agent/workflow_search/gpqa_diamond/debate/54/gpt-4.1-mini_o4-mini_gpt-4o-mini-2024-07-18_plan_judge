Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown organic compound. The following 1H NMR data was obtained:\n1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)\nIdentify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.', choice1='Trans-propenyl acetate', choice2='Cis-propenyl acetate', choice3='Cis-butenyl acetate', choice4='Trans-butenyl acetate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The 1H NMR shows a large trans coupling (J = 16 Hz) between two vinylic protons at 7.0 ppm (d) and 5.5 ppm (dq), a methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H) on the alkene carbon, and a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) for the acetate methyl. No CH2 signals appear, ruling out butenyl acetates. This matches trans-propenyl acetate.
