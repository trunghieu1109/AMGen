A methyl group coupled as a doublet (1.6 ppm) is adjacent to the double bond (–CH=CH–CH3). A singlet at 2.1 ppm is the acetate methyl. Thus the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent P6jc:\nThe 1H NMR shows two vinylic protons: one at 7.0 ppm as a doublet with J = 16 Hz (large trans coupling) and one at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quartets (coupling to the other vinyl H and to a methyl group). The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) is the methyl on the alkene, and the 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is the acetate methyl. The large J = 16 Hz confirms a trans-alkene of CH3–CH=CH–OAc, so the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1XVD:\nThe 1H NMR shows: a doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H) with J = 16 Hz indicating a trans-alkene; a signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) coupling to the 7.0 ppm proton (J = 16 Hz) and to a methyl group (J ≈ 6 Hz); a methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H) from the alkene-adjacent CH3; and a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) for the OAc methyl. No CH2 signals appear, ruling out butenyl acetate. Thus it is trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Qzly:\nThe NMR shows only four signals: a 3H singlet at 2.1 ppm (acetate methyl), a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm (alkene‐substituted methyl), and two vinyl protons at 5.5 ppm (dq, coupling 16 Hz to the other vinyl proton and ~7 Hz to the methyl) and 7.0 ppm (d, J = 16 Hz). A trans alkene coupling of 16 Hz indicates the CH=CH is trans. The pattern corresponds to CH3–CH=CH–OAc (propenyl acetate) with trans stereochemistry. No additional CH2 signals appear, ruling out butenyl acetates.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent GfsG:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent P6jc:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1XVD:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Qzly:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
