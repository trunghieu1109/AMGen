        "response": "To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom, we calculate both values. The transition energy \\Delta E can be calculated using \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. For \\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m, we compute \\Delta E. The paramagnetic coupling term is estimated using \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\sim -\\mu_B B m, where \\mu_B is the Bohr magneton. Given small values of m and B = 1T, the paramagnetic coupling term is expected to be much smaller than the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom. Therefore, we conclude that \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E.\n\nAnswer:A",
