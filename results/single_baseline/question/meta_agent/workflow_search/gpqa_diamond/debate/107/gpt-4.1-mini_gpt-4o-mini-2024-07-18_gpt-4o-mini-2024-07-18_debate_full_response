The transition energy \\Delta E can be calculated using the formula \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

The paramagnetic coupling term for a magnetic field B and small m can be estimated using the formula \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\sim -\\mu_B B m, where \\mu_B is the Bohr magneton. We will calculate both terms and compare them. Generally, for small magnetic fields and small m values, the paramagnetic coupling term is expected to be much smaller than the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom, which is on the order of electron volts, while the coupling term will be much smaller due to the small values of B and m. Thus, we can conclude that \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent IczC:\nTo compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom, we first need to calculate the transition energy \\Delta E using the wavelength given. The energy can be calculated using the formula \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. For \\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} m, we can compute \\Delta E. Next, we evaluate the paramagnetic coupling term, which is proportional to the magnetic field and the orbital magnetic quantum number m. For small values of m and B = 1T, we can estimate the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term. After calculating both values, we can compare them to determine the relationship between the two quantities.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7BaJ:\nTo compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term \\( \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\) with the transition energy \\( \\Delta E \\) of the Hydrogen atom, we need to calculate both quantities.
