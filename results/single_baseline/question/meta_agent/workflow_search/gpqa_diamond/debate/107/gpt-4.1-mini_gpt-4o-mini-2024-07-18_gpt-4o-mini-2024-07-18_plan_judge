proposed answer: To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom, we calculate both values. The transition energy \Delta E can be calculated using \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. For \lambda = 0.4861 \mu m, we compute \Delta E. The paramagnetic coupling term is estimated using \left\langle H\right\rangle \sim -\mu_B B m, where \mu_B is the Bohr magneton. Given small values of m and B = 1T, the paramagnetic coupling term is expected to be much smaller than the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom. Therefore, we conclude that \left\langle H\right\rangle \ll \Delta E.
