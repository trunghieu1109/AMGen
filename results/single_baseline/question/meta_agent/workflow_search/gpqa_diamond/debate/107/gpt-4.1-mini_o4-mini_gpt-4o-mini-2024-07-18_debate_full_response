The transition energy ΔE=hc/λ with λ=0.4861\u2009μm gives ΔE≈(6.63×10^–34\u2009J·s·3×10^8\u2009m/s)/(4.861×10^–7\u2009m)≈4.09×10^–19\u2009J. Comparing magnitudes, ⟨H⟩/ΔE≈10^–5, so ⟨H⟩≪ΔE.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YlY6:\nThe paramagnetic term for an electron in a magnetic field is ΔE_para ≃ μ_B m_l B. For m_l∼1 and B=1 T, μ_B B ≃9.27×10^−24 J. The transition energy for λ=0.4861 μm is ΔE=hc/λ≃(6.626×10^−34 J·s·3.00×10^8 m/s)/(4.861×10^−7 m)≃4.09×10^−19 J. Comparing 9×10^−24 J ≪4×10^−19 J shows the magnetic coupling is about 10^−5 times the optical transition energy, so ⟨H⟩≪ΔE.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent LIcz:\nThe Zeeman (paramagnetic) coupling energy is ΔE_Zeeman≈μ_BmB with μ_B≈9.27×10^−24\u2009J/T, m∼1, B=1\u2009T ⇒ ΔE_Zeeman≈10^−23\u2009J. The hydrogen transition energy for λ=0.4861\u2009μm is E=hc/λ≈(6.63×10^−34 J·s·3×10^8 m/s)/(4.861×10^−7 m)≈4.1×10^−19\u2009J. The ratio ΔE_Zeeman/ΔE≈10^−23/10^−19≈10^−4, so the coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent C7Ba:\nThe paramagnetic (Zeeman) coupling energy is of order μB B with μB=9.274×10⁻²⁴ J/T and B=1 T giving ≃9.3×10⁻²⁴ J. The transition energy for λ=0.4861 μm is ΔE=hc/λ≈(6.626×10⁻³⁴·3.00×10⁸)/(4.861×10⁻⁷)≈4.1×10⁻¹⁹ J. Comparing, μB B/ΔE≈9×10⁻²⁴/4×10⁻¹⁹≈2×10⁻⁵≪1, so the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent PbgT:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YlY6:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent LIcz:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent C7Ba:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
