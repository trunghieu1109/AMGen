proposed answer: To determine the relationship between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we calculate both values. The paramagnetic coupling term is given by \( \langle H \rangle = \mu_B B m \), where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \) T, and \( m \) is small. This term is small in magnitude. The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is calculated using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) with \( \lambda = 0.4861 \mu m \). This energy is significant as it corresponds to a visible light transition in hydrogen. Comparing the two, \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \), leading to the conclusion that \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).
