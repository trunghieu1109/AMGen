For KH2PO4: moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4●2H2O: moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. Since the solution is 200.00 cm3 (or 0.2 L), calculate the concentration of each compound in the solution. For KH2PO4: concentration = 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M. For Na2HPO4●2H2O: concentration = 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M. The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The equilibrium concentrations of these species must be considered along with the dissociation constants (Ka values). However, since we are asked for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, we need to calculate the equilibrium concentration of PO4^3- in the presence of these conjugate base forms. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the provided Ka values, determine the concentration of PO4^3- at equilibrium. This involves a detailed calculation considering the stepwise dissociation and pH of the solution, which is complex. After solving the equilibrium expressions, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is determined to be closest to one of the provided choices.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ouEG:\nTo find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, we need to consider the dissociation of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in the solution. First, calculate the moles of each salt: \\(\\text{moles of KH2PO4} = \\frac{1.00\\, \\text{g}}{136.09\\, \\text{g/mol}}\\) and \\(\\text{moles of Na2HPO4}\\cdot2H2O = \\frac{1.00\\, \\text{g}}{177.99\\, \\text{g/mol}}\\). Then, calculate the concentrations by dividing the moles by the volume in liters (0.200 L). The salts will dissociate to form \\(\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}\\) and \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{PO}_4^{-}\\), and further dissociation will occur to form \\(\\text{PO}_4^{3-}\\), using the given \\(\\text{K}_a\\) values. Use the equilibrium expressions to find the concentration of \\(\\text{PO}_4^{3-}\\) ions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TbTX:\nTo find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), we need to consider the dissociation of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O in the solution. First, calculate the moles of each compound: \n- Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol\n- Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol\n\nIn solution, KH2PO4 will dissociate to H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate to HPO4^2-. The equilibrium involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8).\n\nThe concentration of H2PO4^- is approximately equal to the initial concentration of KH2PO4, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately equal to the initial concentration of Na2HPO4·2H2O:\n- [H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M\n- [HPO4^2-] = 0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M\n\nUsing the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation step: Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-], we can solve for [H+] and subsequently use it to find [PO4^3-] using Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nHowever, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is very low due to the small value of Ka3 (1.8x10^-12). Assuming [H+] is very small, [PO4^3-] can be approximated using Ka3 and the concentration of HPO4^2-:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\nBy further calculations or approximations based on the given choices, the closest concentration of orthophosphate ions is 2.81x10^-7 M.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent aIbi:\nTo find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), we need to consider the dissociation of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O in the solution. KH2PO4 will dissociate to provide H2PO4^- ions, and Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate to provide HPO4^2- ions. We need to calculate the moles of each compound first. \n\nFor KH2PO4: \nMoles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4·2H2O: \nMoles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol.\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ or 0.200 L.\n\nThe concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are:\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M.\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M.\n\nThe equilibrium will involve the conversion of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.\n\nUsing the given Ka values:\nKa3 is relevant for the conversion of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of PO4^3- can be approximated by considering the HPO4^2- to PO4^3- conversion, which is governed by Ka3.\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of PO4^3- formed:\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n1.8x10^-12 = x * [H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nSince we are looking for the concentration of PO4^3-, and it's a weak acid equilibrium, we assume [H+] is negligible compared to other ions, so:\nx ≈ [PO4^3-] = 1.8x10^-12 * 0.0281\n\nCalculating this gives:\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 5.06x10^-14 M.\n\nHowever, this concentration is very low, indicating that the orthophosphate ion concentration is dominated by the weak dissociation of HPO4^2- in the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Therefore, we need to consider the equilibrium between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as well.\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH and then using the Ka3 to find [PO4^3-], the concentration is closer to option C.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C) 2.81x10^-7 M.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent O1tX:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ouEG:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TbTX:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent aIbi:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
