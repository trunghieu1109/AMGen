    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;5.48x10^-7 M &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;6.24x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2.81x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;3.97x10^-7 M &#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent GTbT:
To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we first need to determine the amount of phosphate contributed by both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. KH2PO4 dissociates to give one H2PO4- ion, and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates to give one HPO4^2- ion. The total phosphate contribution from both salts can be calculated using their respective molar masses and the amounts given. We then convert that to molarity by dividing by the volume of the solution in liters. Finally, we apply the dissociation constants to find the equilibrium concentrations of the orthophosphate ions. After calculating, we find that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is closest to one of the provided choices.

### thinking by Debate Agent XaIb:
To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we first need to calculate the moles of each phosphate salt present. KH2PO4 dissociates to produce H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates to produce HPO4^2-. The equilibrium concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will determine the concentration of PO4^3- through the dissociation of these species. We will use the dissociation constants (Ka values) to find the equilibrium concentrations of these species and ultimately calculate the concentration of PO4^3- ions. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is 0.200 L. We will convert grams to moles using the molar masses provided and then use the appropriate equations to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

### thinking by Debate Agent i2d4:
To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we first need to determine the number of moles of each phosphate compound present, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4•2H2O, and how they contribute to the orthophosphate ions. 

1. Calculate moles of KH2PO4:
   Moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol.

2. Calculate moles of Na2HPO4•2H2O:
   Moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol.

3. Each KH2PO4 contributes 1 mole of H2PO4^- which can dissociate to produce PO4^3-.  
   Each Na2HPO4 contributes 1 mole of HPO4^2- which can further dissociate to produce PO4^3-. 

4. The equilibrium concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be affected by the dissociation constants (Ka) of phosphoric acid. 

5. Calculate the total concentration of PO4^3- in the solution from both sources:
   The contributions from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be calculated using the dissociation constants, but for simplicity, we can estimate that the contributions are small and the main source will be from the dissociation of HPO4^2-. 

6. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, or 0.200 L. 

7. Finally, we sum the contributions and divide by the volume to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. After performing the calculations, we find the concentration of orthophosphate ions to be approximately 6.24x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent PVPV:
To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we need to first determine the moles of each phosphate compound present in the solution. KH2PO4 dissociates to give H2PO4- ions, and Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates to give HPO4^2- ions. The total phosphate ions include H2PO4-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. We will calculate their contributions based on the dissociation constants given and the concentrations of the original compounds. After calculating the moles of each phosphate species, we will convert them to concentrations based on the total volume of the solution (200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L). Then we will sum the concentrations of orthophosphate ions to find the final concentration.

    <pre>To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we need to calculate the moles of each phosphate compound present, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4•2H2O. KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-. The dissociation of these species will lead to the formation of PO4^3-. After calculating the moles of each compound and their contributions to the orthophosphate ions, we find that the concentration of PO4^3- is primarily influenced by the dissociation of HPO4^2-. The calculations indicate that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice 2. This is supported by multiple calculations and reasoning from different perspectives.
