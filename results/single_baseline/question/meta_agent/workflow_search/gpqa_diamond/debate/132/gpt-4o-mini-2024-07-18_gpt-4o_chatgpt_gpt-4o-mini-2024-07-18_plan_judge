Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. The moles of each compound are calculated as 0.00735 mol for KH2PO4 and 0.00562 mol for Na2HPO4●2H2O. The total volume of the solution is 0.200 L. The dissociation of these compounds in water and the equilibrium constants (Ka values) determine the concentration of PO4^3-. The equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- is governed by Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the given Ka values, the concentration of PO4^3- is calculated. After reviewing the calculations and the reasoning provided by the agents, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is found to be 3.97x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice D.
