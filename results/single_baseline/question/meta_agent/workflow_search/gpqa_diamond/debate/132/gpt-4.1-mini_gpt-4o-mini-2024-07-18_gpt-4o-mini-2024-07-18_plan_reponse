            "We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 \u00b0C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.",

        "n": "Baseline debate",
        "response": "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we need to calculate the moles of each phosphate compound present, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u20222H2O. KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-. The dissociation of these species will lead to the formation of PO4^3-. After calculating the moles of each compound and their contributions to the orthophosphate ions, we find that the concentration of PO4^3- is primarily influenced by the dissociation of HPO4^2-. The calculations indicate that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice 2. This is supported by multiple calculations and reasoning from different perspectives.\n\nAnswer:6.24x10^-7 M",
