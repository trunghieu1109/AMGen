First, calculate the moles of each compound: Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. Moles of Na2HPO4•2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm^3 = 0.200 L. The concentration of phosphate ions is determined by the dissociation of these salts in water. KH2PO4 is a source of H2PO4^- ions, and Na2HPO4•2H2O is a source of HPO4^2- ions. The dissociation of these ions in water and the equilibrium constants (Ka values) will determine the concentration of PO4^3-. The final concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the equilibrium expressions and the provided Ka values. After calculating, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is found to be 5.48x10^-7 M.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ouEG:\nFirst, determine the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4●2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.200 L. The orthophosphate ion concentration is determined by the equilibrium of these species in solution. KH2PO4 is a weak acid and Na2HPO4 is its conjugate base. The main equilibrium involves HPO4^2- and PO4^3- ions. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, calculate the pH and then the concentration of PO4^3- ions. The pKa value needed here is the one corresponding to the HPO4^2- to PO4^3- conversion, which is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. Calculate the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the concentration of HPO4^2- and [HA] is the concentration of H2PO4^-. Finally, use the pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TbTX:\nTo find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we first need to determine the molarity of each phosphate compound in the solution. \n\nFirst, calculate the moles of KH2PO4:\nMoles of KH2PO4 = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol\n\nNext, calculate the moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O:\nMoles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is 0.20000 L.\n\nNow, calculate the molarity of each compound:\nMolarity of KH2PO4 = 0.00735 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03675 M\nMolarity of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 0.00562 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02810 M\n\nKH2PO4 is a source of H2PO4- ions, while Na2HPO4 is a source of HPO4^2- ions. \n\nThe equilibrium between H2PO4- and HPO4^2- is governed by the second dissociation constant, Ka2.\n\nH2PO4- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+\nKa2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4-] = 6.2x10^-8\n\nAssuming that the solution is buffered and the pH does not change significantly, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) can be calculated using the equilibrium:\n\nHPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8x10^-12\n\nWith the given Ka3 value and assuming the [H+] from the dissociation of H2PO4- to HPO4^2- is negligible, the concentration of PO4^3- is calculated using the initial concentration of HPO4^2-:\n\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n\nAssuming [H+] is governed by the buffer system and is approximately equal to the pKa2 value, which is around 7.21 (pKa2 = -log(Ka2)), we can estimate:\n\n[H+] ≈ 10^-7.21 M\n\nNow, calculate [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = 1.8x10^-12 * 0.02810 M / 10^-7.21 = 3.97x10^-7 M\n\nThus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 3.97x10^-7 M.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent aIbi:\nTo find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), we need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the phosphate species in the solution. We start by calculating the initial molarity of each phosphate salt. For KH2PO4, the moles are 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol, and for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the moles are 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm^3 or 0.20000 L. The initial concentrations are 0.00735 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03675 M for KH2PO4 and 0.00562 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02810 M for Na2HPO4. In solution, KH2PO4 acts as a weak acid and Na2HPO4 as a weak base. The dissociation of these will be governed by the Ka values of H3PO4. We are interested in the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. The equilibrium concentration of PO4^3- can be approximated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the second and third dissociations. However, due to the presence of both salts, we use the buffer equation and the given Ka values to solve for the concentration of PO4^3-. After calculating, the concentration of PO4^3- is closest to 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent O1tX:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ouEG:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TbTX:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent aIbi:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
