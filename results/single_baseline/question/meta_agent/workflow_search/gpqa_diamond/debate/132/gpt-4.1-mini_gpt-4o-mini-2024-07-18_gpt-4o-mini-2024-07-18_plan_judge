Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we need to calculate the moles of each phosphate compound present, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4•2H2O. KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-. The dissociation of these species will lead to the formation of PO4^3-. After calculating the moles of each compound and their contributions to the orthophosphate ions, we find that the concentration of PO4^3- is primarily influenced by the dissociation of HPO4^2-. The calculations indicate that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice 2. This is supported by multiple calculations and reasoning from different perspectives.

Answer:6.24x10^-7 M
Extracted answer: 6.24x10^-7 M
Correct answer: 2
