            "We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 \u00b0C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.",

        "response": "The problem involves calculating the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O. The moles of each compound are calculated as 0.00735 mol for KH2PO4 and 0.00562 mol for Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O. The total volume of the solution is 0.200 L. The dissociation of these compounds in water and the equilibrium constants (Ka values) determine the concentration of PO4^3-. The equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- is governed by Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the given Ka values, the concentration of PO4^3- is calculated. After reviewing the calculations and the reasoning provided by the agents, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is found to be 3.97x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice D.\n\nAnswer:D)",
