            "We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 \u00b0C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.",

        "response": "All agents have calculated the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O and their respective concentrations in the solution. They considered the dissociation of these compounds and the equilibrium involving the dissociation constants (Ka values) of phosphoric acid. The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is determined by the equilibrium involving HPO4^2- and the third dissociation constant (Ka3). After considering the equilibrium expressions and approximations, all agents agree that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is closest to option C) 2.81x10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)",
