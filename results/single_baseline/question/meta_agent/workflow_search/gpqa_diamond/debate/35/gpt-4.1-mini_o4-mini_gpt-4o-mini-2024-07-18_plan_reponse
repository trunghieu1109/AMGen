            "Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?",

        "response": "The observed absorption line energy of ~3.9\u00d710\u207b\u2076 eV corresponds to a frequency of \u03bd=E/h \u22430.94 GHz. The rest\u2010frame hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I 21 cm line) is at 1.420 GHz (E\u22485.9\u00d710\u207b\u2076 eV). Redshifting by z\u22480.51 brings it down to ~0.94 GHz, matching a source at ~2.1 Gpc. In the Milky Way this 21 cm absorption is produced by cold neutral atomic hydrogen (cold atomic interstellar medium), since only low\u2010temperature H I clouds have enough optical depth to show strong absorption.\n\nAnswer:B)",
