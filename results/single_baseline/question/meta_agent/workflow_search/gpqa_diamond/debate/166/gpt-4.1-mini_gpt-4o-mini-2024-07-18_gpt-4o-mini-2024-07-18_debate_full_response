Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent Qxc8', content='To determine the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to compute the relative entropy measure using the provided formulas. After substituting phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 into the equations for the state |psi> and the normalization constant N, we can derive the density matrices rho and tau. The calculations of the traces required for the relative entropy measure will lead us to the value of nG.
