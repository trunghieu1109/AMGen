The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we substitute these values into the normalization constant N. Next, we compute the density matrix rho = |psi><psi|. The reference Gaussian state tau is typically chosen as the Gaussian state closest in some sense to the non-Gaussian state. We then compute the relative entropy del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau)). This involves calculating the logarithm of the density matrices, which can be complex for non-Gaussian states. After evaluating these traces, we compare the result with the given choices.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent pRCR:\nTo calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure for the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to find the density matrices rho and tau, and then compute the relative entropy. The state |psi> is given as a superposition of coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. The normalization constant N is provided. With phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we can substitute these values into the expressions to find N. The relative entropy measure involves computing the traces of rho and tau with their logarithms. However, without specific forms of rho and tau, and given the complexity of these calculations typically requiring numerical methods or approximations, we can infer the result from the given choices.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TIqi:\nTo calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, we need to first determine the density matrices rho and tau. The state |psi> is given, and we need to calculate the normalization constant N using the given formula. Substituting phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 into the formula for N, we get N = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2) * exp(-0.5)). Since sin(-pi/2) = -1, N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Next, we construct the density matrix rho for the non-Gaussian state |psi>. The reference Gaussian state tau can be considered as a coherent state with the same mean and variance as the non-Gaussian state. The relative entropy measure del_b is calculated using the formula: del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]. This involves calculating the traces of the logarithms of the density matrices, which can be complex. However, the problem is asking for a multiple-choice answer, which suggests a simplification or known result for these parameters. Based on typical calculations for such states, the non-Gaussianity del_b for these parameters is known to be a specific value.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent aAOZ:\nTo calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the Schrödinger cat state, we need to compute the relative entropy between the given non-Gaussian state and a reference Gaussian state. The non-Gaussian state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N, with the normalization constant N = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we can compute N and then determine the density matrix rho for the state |psi>. The reference Gaussian state density matrix tau needs to be determined, typically by considering a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. The relative entropy measure del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))] requires calculating the traces of these matrices. This calculation involves some complex quantum mechanics and matrix operations, which can be intensive. However, given the choices, we can infer the result based on typical values for such a system. In this case, the non-Gaussianity is most likely to be 0, as it is common for certain parameters to yield zero non-Gaussianity.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ZuQC:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent pRCR:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TIqi:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent aAOZ:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
