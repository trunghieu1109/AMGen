Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: For φ=−π/4 the state is the odd Schrödinger cat which is pure (S(ρ)=0). The reference Gaussian τ has the same covariance matrix V with symplectic eigenvalue v=√[(n̄+1/2)²−|⟨a²⟩|²] where n̄=α²(1+e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²})≈1.0209 and ⟨a²⟩=α²=0.25. This gives v≈1.50017. Then S(τ)=(v+½)ln(v+½)−(v−½)ln(v−½)≈1.3865, so δ_{nG}=S(τ)≈1.38.
