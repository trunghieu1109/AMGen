            "An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?",

At v=0.99999987\u2009c, \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2013v\u00b2)\u22481/\u221a(2\u00d7(1\u2013v))\u22481/\u221a(2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2077)\u22481960. The proper travel time is \u03c4=L/(\u03b3v)\u2248160,000\u2009ly/(1960\u00d71\u2009c)\u224881.6\u2009years, so about 81\u2009years.\n\nAnswer:D)",
