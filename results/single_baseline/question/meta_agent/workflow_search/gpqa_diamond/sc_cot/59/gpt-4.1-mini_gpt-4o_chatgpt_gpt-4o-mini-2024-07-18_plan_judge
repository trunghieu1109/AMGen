Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves time dilation, which is a concept from the theory of relativity. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is different from the time experienced by an observer at rest with respect to Earth. The time dilation formula is t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t' is the time experienced by the observer, t is the proper time experienced by the traveling astronaut, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. We are given v = 0.99999987c and need to find out how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth, such that the astronaut ages 22 years. Plugging in these values, we solve for t'.

Answer:77 years
Extracted answer: 77 years
Correct answer: 4
