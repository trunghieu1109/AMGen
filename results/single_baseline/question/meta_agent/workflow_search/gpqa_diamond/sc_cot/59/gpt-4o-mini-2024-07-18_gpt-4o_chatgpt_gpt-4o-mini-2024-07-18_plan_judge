Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to traveling at relativistic speeds. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is different from the time experienced by an observer on Earth (coordinate time). The relevant formula is the time dilation formula: t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t' is the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut), t is the coordinate time (time experienced by an observer at rest relative to Earth), v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light. We are given that the velocity v = 0.99999987 * c. The astronaut's proper time to reach Earth is given as 22 years. We need to find the coordinate time t, which will tell us how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from the perspective of an observer on Earth. We rearrange the formula to find t: t = t' * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Substituting the values, we get t = 22 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Solving this will give us the coordinate time, and we will compare it with the average lifetime of the aliens, which is 150 years. If the coordinate time is less than 150 years, the astronaut will reach Earth before dying; otherwise, they will die before reaching Earth.
