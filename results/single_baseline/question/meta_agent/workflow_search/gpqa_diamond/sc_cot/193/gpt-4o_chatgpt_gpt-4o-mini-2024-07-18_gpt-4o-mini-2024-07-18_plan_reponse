        "response": "To find the partition function Z of the system of three spins, we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins and their corresponding energies. Each spin can take values +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 configurations. We calculate the energy for each configuration using the given formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] and then sum the Boltzmann factors e^(-E/kT) for all configurations to obtain Z. After calculating the energies for each configuration, we can match the resulting Z with the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)",
