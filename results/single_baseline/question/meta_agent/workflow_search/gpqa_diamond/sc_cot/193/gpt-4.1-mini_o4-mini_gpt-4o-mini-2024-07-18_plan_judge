Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have 3 spins S1,S2,S3 each ±1. Energy E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Partition function Z = ∑ e^{-βE} over 2^3=8 states.
Case 1: All spins same (+++, ---): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 3, so E = -3J, weight e^{-β(-3J)} = e^{3Jβ}. Number of such states = 2.
Case 2: Two spins up, one down or two down, one up (6 states): e.g., ++- gives S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1-1-1 = -1 so E = -J(-1) = J, weight e^{-βJ} = e^{-Jβ}. Number of such states = 6.
Thus Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, which matches choice 1.
