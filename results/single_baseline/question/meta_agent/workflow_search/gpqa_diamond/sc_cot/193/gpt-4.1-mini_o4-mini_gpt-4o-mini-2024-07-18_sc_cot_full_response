Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OYu9', content='We have 3 spins S1,S2,S3 each ±1. Energy E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Partition function Z = ∑ e^{-βE} over 2^3=8 states.\nCase 1: All spins same (+++, ---): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 3, so E = -3J, weight e^{-β(-3J)} = e^{3Jβ}. Number of such states = 2.\nCase 2: Two spins up, one down or two down, one up (6 states): e.g., ++- gives S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = 1-1-1 = -1 so E = -J(-1) = J, weight e^{-βJ} = e^{-Jβ}. Number of such states = 6.\nThus Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, which matches choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
