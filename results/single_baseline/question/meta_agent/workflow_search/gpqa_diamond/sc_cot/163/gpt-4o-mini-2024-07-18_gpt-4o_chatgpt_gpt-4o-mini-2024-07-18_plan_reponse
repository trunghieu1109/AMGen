            "Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.",

        "response": "To determine the relative masses of the two binary star systems, we can use Kepler's third law and the information about radial velocity amplitudes. The period of the binary system and the radial velocity amplitudes can be used to estimate the masses of the stars in the system. For system_1, the period is 2 years, and the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the period is 1 year, and the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The mass function for a binary system is related to the cube of the orbital period and the cube of the radial velocity amplitude. We can use the ratio of the mass functions to estimate the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass function is proportional to (P^2/3) * (K1 + K2)^3, where P is the period and K1, K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, P = 2 years, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s. For system_2, P = 1 year, K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately (2^(2/3)) * ((10 + 5)^3 / (15 + 10)^3). This simplifies to (~1.59) * (15^3 / 25^3) = (~1.59) * (3375 / 15625) = (~1.59) * (~0.216) = ~0.343. The closest choice to ~0.343 is ~0.4.\n\nAnswer:A)",
