            "Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.",

        "response": "To determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we can use the mass function derived from the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital periods. The mass function for a binary system can be approximated by the formula: M1 + M2 = (K1^3 * P) / (2 * pi * G), where K1 is the radial velocity amplitude of the primary star, P is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant. For system_1, we have K1 = 10 km/s and P = 2 years. For system_2, K1 = 15 km/s and P = 1 year. We can calculate the mass for each system and then find the ratio of their masses. After performing the calculations, we find that the mass of system_1 is approximately 1.2 times that of system_2. Thus, system_1 is more massive than system_2 by a factor of ~ 1.2.\n\nAnswer:~ 1.2",
