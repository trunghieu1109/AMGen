            "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>",

        "response": "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that disrupts the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This can be achieved by introducing a mutation that leads to a premature stop codon or a frameshift, causing a nonfunctional protein. Let's analyze the mutants:\n\n- Mutant 1: A single nucleotide change (C to A) in the first exon. This is a missense mutation and unlikely to disrupt the gene function.\n- Mutant 2: A single nucleotide change (C to A) introduces a stop codon (TAG) early in the sequence. This will likely result in a truncated, nonfunctional protein.\n- Mutant 3: A single nucleotide change (C to T) in the first exon. This is a missense mutation and unlikely to disrupt the gene function.\n- Mutant 4: A deletion that causes a frameshift and likely results in a nonfunctional protein.\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon, which is a strong candidate for eliminating the gene's function. Mutant 4 also disrupts the gene through a frameshift, but Mutant 2 is more direct in its effect.\n\nAnswer:A)",
