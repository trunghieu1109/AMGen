    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’&lt;b&gt;&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Mutant 2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Mutant 4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;Mutant 1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Mutant 3&#39;}

    <pre>To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need a mutation that disrupts the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. Since the mutations are in the first exon, which is part of the coding sequence, a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon or frameshift could render the protein non-functional. Let&#39;s analyze the mutations:

1. Mutant 1: The sequence change is from &#39;TTT&#39; to &#39;TTC&#39;, which are both codons for phenylalanine. This is a synonymous mutation and will not affect the protein function.
2. Mutant 2: The sequence change is from &#39;TTT&#39; to &#39;TTA&#39;, which changes the codon from phenylalanine to leucine. This is a missense mutation but may not necessarily disrupt the protein function.
3. Mutant 3: The sequence change introduces &#39;TAC&#39; instead of &#39;TTC&#39;, which changes phenylalanine to tyrosine. Additionally, there is a change later in the sequence that could potentially affect splicing or protein function.
4. Mutant 4: The sequence change introduces a stop codon &#39;TGA&#39; early in the sequence, likely resulting in a truncated and non-functional protein.

Mutant 4 introduces a premature stop codon, which is most likely to eliminate the function of the gene. This would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.
