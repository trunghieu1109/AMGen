            "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>",

        "response": "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify which mutation likely disrupts the synthesis of the compound. The intact gene starts with 'ATGTTT', and we can analyze the changes in the mutants. Mutant 1 changes 'TTT' to 'TAC', Mutant 2 changes 'TTT' to 'TAA', Mutant 3 changes 'TTT' to 'TTA', and Mutant 4 changes 'TTT' to 'TTT'. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (TAA) early in the sequence which would likely lead to a truncated protein that is not functional, potentially eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations do not introduce a stop codon and may result in functional proteins. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAnswer:Mutant 2",
