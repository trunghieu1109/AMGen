Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, we need to consider how the computations can be split and executed in parallel. The problem involves approximating the matrix exponential function, which can be done using fractional approximations. The key factor in parallelizing such computations often involves how the approximation can be decomposed or split into independent parts that can be computed concurrently. In this context, the linear partial fraction decomposition of a fractional approximation allows the problem to be split into simpler sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel. This is because each term in the partial fraction can be computed independently of the others. Therefore, the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation is crucial for parallelization.
