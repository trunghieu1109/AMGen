Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To parallelize the approximation of the matrix exponential using a rational (fractional) approximation, one performs a partial fraction decomposition. This breaks the global computation into independent shifted solves or exponentials that can be carried out concurrently. Hence, the linear partial fraction decomposition is the key for converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.
