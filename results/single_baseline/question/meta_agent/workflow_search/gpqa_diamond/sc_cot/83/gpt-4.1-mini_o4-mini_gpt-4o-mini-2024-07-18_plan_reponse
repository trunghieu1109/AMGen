        "response": "To parallelize the approximation of the matrix exponential using a rational (fractional) approximation, one performs a partial fraction decomposition. This breaks the global computation into independent shifted solves or exponentials that can be carried out concurrently. Hence, the linear partial fraction decomposition is the key for converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.\n\nAnswer:C)",
