Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, we need to identify the aspect of the problem that allows for parallel execution. In the context of approximating the matrix exponential function using a fractional approximation, the key factor is likely related to how the approximation can be decomposed into parts that can be computed independently. The 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation' suggests a decomposition into simpler terms, which can be computed in parallel. This is a common technique in parallelizing algorithms involving matrix functions.
