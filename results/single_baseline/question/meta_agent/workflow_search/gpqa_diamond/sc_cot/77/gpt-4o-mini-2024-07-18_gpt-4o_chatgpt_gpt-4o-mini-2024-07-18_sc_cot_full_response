Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent tnE6', content='To solve this problem, we need to use the LiÃ©nard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. The scalar potential V at the observation point \\vec{r} and time t is given by V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}, where \\vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, and \\vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential \\vec{A} is given by \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}.
