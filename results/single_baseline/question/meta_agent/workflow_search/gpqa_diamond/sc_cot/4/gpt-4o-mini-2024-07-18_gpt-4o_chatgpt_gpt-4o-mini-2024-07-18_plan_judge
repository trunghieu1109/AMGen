proposed answer: The operator \( \vec{P} \) for a spin-1/2 particle is analogous to the Pauli matrices. The components are given as: \( P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \), \( P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \), and \( P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \). The direction \( \vec{n} \) in the x-z plane can be parameterized as \( \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \). The operator along this direction is \( P_n = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z \). This simplifies to \( P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}) \). Solving the eigenvalue equation \( P_n \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) gives the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \). The normalized eigenvector is \( \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix} \).
