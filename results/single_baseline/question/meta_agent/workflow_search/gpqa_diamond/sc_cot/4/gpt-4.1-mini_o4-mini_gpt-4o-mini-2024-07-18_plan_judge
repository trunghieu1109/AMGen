Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n', choice1='(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028', choice2='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)', choice3='(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n', choice4='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We have a spin-½ particle operator P with components as Pauli matrices times ℏ/2. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ℏ/2 along direction n with spherical angles (θ,φ) is (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)). Since n lies in the x-z plane, φ=0, giving (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches choice3.
