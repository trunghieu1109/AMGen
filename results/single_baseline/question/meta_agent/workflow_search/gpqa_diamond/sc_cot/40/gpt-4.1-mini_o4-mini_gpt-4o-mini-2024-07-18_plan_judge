Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the rest frame of the moving glass, light travels at speed u=c/n=1/n. In the lab frame, velocities add via the relativistic formula U=(u+v)/(1+u v). Substituting u=1/n gives U=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+nv)/(n+v). This matches choice3.
