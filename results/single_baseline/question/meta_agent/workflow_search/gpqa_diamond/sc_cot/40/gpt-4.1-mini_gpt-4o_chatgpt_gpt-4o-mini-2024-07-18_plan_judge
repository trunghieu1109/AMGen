Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the effect of the moving medium on the speed of light relative to the observer. In the medium (glass), the speed of light is c/n. However, since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The relativistic velocity addition formula is: u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2), where u is the speed of light in the medium (c/n), and v is the velocity of the medium (glass) relative to the observer. Since c = 1, we have u = 1/n and the formula becomes: u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v). Simplifying this expression gives us the speed of light relative to the observer. Let's simplify: u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) = ((1 + nv) / n) / ((n + v) / n) = (1 + nv) / (n + v). This matches choice 3.
