Question: {'question': 'A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', 'choice1': '(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', 'choice2': '(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', 'choice3': '(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', 'choice4': '1'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent S6HI', content='In the rest frame of the moving glass, light travels at speed u=c/n=1/n. In the lab frame, velocities add via the relativistic formula U=(u+v)/(1+u v). Substituting u=1/n gives U=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n)=(1+nv)/(n+v). This matches choice3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
