            "A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?

        "response": "To find the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we need to consider the effects of the motion of the glass and the refractive index. The speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. The glass is moving towards the observer, which affects the observed speed of the light beam. We can use the formula for relativistic addition of velocities to find the effective speed.\n\nAnswer:(1+n*v)/(n-v)",
