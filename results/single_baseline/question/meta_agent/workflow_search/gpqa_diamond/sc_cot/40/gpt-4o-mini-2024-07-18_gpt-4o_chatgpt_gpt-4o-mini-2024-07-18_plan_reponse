The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is 1/n. Since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2), where u is the speed of light in the glass, v is the speed of the glass, and c is the speed of light in vacuum (c = 1 in this case). Substituting u = 1/n and c = 1, we get u' = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (v/n)). Simplifying this, we get u' = (1 + nv) / (n + v).\n\nAnswer:C)",
