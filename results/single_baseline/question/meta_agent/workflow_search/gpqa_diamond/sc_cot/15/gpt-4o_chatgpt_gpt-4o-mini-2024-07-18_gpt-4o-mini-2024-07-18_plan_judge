proposed answer: To determine how many of the listed compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center and does not have a plane of symmetry. 

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound has a double bond and is not chiral. 
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers and is optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers and is optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers but is not optically active because it is a meso compound.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has one chiral center and is optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has multiple hydroxyl groups but is symmetric and not optically active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound has one chiral center and is optically active.

Counting the optically active compounds gives us: 3 (the second, third, fifth, and seventh compounds). Therefore, the answer is 4.
