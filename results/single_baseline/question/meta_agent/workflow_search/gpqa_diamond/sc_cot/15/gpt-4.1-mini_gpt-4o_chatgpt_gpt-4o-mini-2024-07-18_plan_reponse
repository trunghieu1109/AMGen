        "response": "To determine if a compound exhibits optical activity, we need to check for chirality. A compound is chiral if it has a non-superimposable mirror image, often due to the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different groups attached). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound does not have a chiral center as it does not have a carbon with four different groups.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers at 3a and 7a, thus it is optically active.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This is a meso compound due to internal symmetry, so it is not optically active.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has chiral centers and is optically active.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has a chiral center, so it is optically active.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and not optically active.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound does not have a chiral center, so it is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the optically active compounds are: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. There are 3 optically active compounds.\n\nAnswer:3",
