Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to count optically active (chiral, no internal mirror, isolatable) compounds among the 7 given.
1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no stereocenter (sp2 carbons), achiral.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: two stereocenters, designated R/S, no symmetry plane, chiral.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: two stereocenters of opposite configuration, meso form, achiral.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: two like stereocenters, enantiomeric pair, each is optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one stereocenter at C-1, ring unsymmetrical, chiral.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters but molecule has a mirror plane or rapidly racemizes via chair flip, achiral in practice.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: the only stereogenic carbon would bear two identical methyl groups, not stereogenic, achiral.
Chiral compounds are #2, #4 and #5, total = 3.
