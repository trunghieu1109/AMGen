        "response": "To determine optical activity, a compound must have at least one chiral center and no internal plane of symmetry. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound does not have a chiral center as it has a double bond and lacks the necessary four different groups around a carbon atom.\n\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has chiral centers at 3a and 7a, and it is likely to be optically active if it does not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound is meso because it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers and is not meso, so it is optically active.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has a single chiral center at the R position, so it is optically active.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has multiple chiral centers but is arranged in a way that it is symmetrical, making it optically inactive.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound does not have a chiral center, so it is not optically active.\n\nFrom this analysis, the optically active compounds are 2, 4, and 5, totaling 3 compounds.\n\nAnswer:3",
