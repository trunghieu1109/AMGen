Question: Example(question='In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.', choice1='2-styrylepoxide', choice2='2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', choice3='2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', choice4='2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To identify Compound X (C11H12O), we need to analyze the provided 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows signals for methyl groups (3H, s) at δ 2.28 and δ 2.31, suggesting two methyl groups are present. The aromatic region shows several signals indicating a substituted aromatic ring. The 13C-NMR supports the presence of multiple aromatic carbons and the characteristic signals for an epoxide due to the oxygen atom. By matching the molecular formula and the spectral data, we can determine the structure of Compound X. The structure that fits the data best is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, as it has the right number of carbons and the required functional groups.

Answer:2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
Extracted answer: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
Correct answer: 2
