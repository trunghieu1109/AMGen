            "In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: \u03b4 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.",

        "response": "To identify Compound X, we need to analyze the provided NMR data and compare it with the given choices.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 1H NMR data:\n- \u03b4 2.28 (3H, s) and \u03b4 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating for 3 hydrogens, suggesting the presence of two methyl groups.\n- \u03b4 6.75 (1H, d), \u03b4 7.08 (2H, d), \u03b4 7.68 (1H, d), \u03b4 7.71 (2H, d): These are doublets in the aromatic region, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nNext, the 13C NMR data:\n- \u03b4 21.3 and \u03b4 28.4: These are likely the methyl carbons.\n- \u03b4 126.9, \u03b4 127.1, \u03b4 129.1, \u03b4 130.3: These are aromatic carbons, indicating a benzene ring.\n- \u03b4 141.5 and \u03b4 144.1: These could be the carbons adjacent to the double bond in a styryl group.\n- \u03b4 197.7: This is a carbonyl carbon, suggesting a ketone or aldehyde, but this seems to be an error since there is no carbonyl in the choices.\n\nAnalyzing the choices:\nA) 2-styrylepoxide: This compound would have a styryl group and an epoxide, but no methyl groups.\nB) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: This compound has a styryl group with a para-methyl group, matching the aromatic pattern and the methyl singlets.\nC) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: This has a phenyl group and a propene with a methyl, but the aromatic pattern may not match perfectly.\nD) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: This compound has a styryl group and a methyl group, but the methyl pattern is not as clear.\n\nBased on the data, choice B, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, matches the NMR data better as it accounts for the para-substituted benzene and the two methyl singlets.\n\nAnswer:B)",
