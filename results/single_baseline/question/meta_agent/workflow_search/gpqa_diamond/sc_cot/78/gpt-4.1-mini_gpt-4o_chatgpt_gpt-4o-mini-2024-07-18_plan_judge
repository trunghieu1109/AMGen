proposed answer: To identify Compound X, we need to analyze the provided NMR data and compare it with the given choices.

First, let's consider the 1H NMR data:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating for 3 hydrogens, suggesting the presence of two methyl groups.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): These are doublets in the aromatic region, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.

Next, the 13C NMR data:
- δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: These are likely the methyl carbons.
- δ 126.9, δ 127.1, δ 129.1, δ 130.3: These are aromatic carbons, indicating a benzene ring.
- δ 141.5 and δ 144.1: These could be the carbons adjacent to the double bond in a styryl group.
- δ 197.7: This is a carbonyl carbon, suggesting a ketone or aldehyde, but this seems to be an error since there is no carbonyl in the choices.

Analyzing the choices:
A) 2-styrylepoxide: This compound would have a styryl group and an epoxide, but no methyl groups.
B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: This compound has a styryl group with a para-methyl group, matching the aromatic pattern and the methyl singlets.
C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: This has a phenyl group and a propene with a methyl, but the aromatic pattern may not match perfectly.
D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: This compound has a styryl group and a methyl group, but the methyl pattern is not as clear.

Based on the data, choice B, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, matches the NMR data better as it accounts for the para-substituted benzene and the two methyl singlets.
