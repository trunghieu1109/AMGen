    <pre>The given NMR data provides clues about the structure of the product. The 1H NMR shows two singlets at δ 2.28 and δ 2.31, each integrating for 3H, which suggests the presence of two methyl groups. The aromatic region shows signals at δ 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71, which are consistent with an aromatic ring with some substitution pattern. The 13C NMR shows signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4, which are likely the carbons of the methyl groups. The aromatic carbons appear at δ 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3. The signals at δ 141.5 and 144.1 could be the carbons of the double bond, and the signal at δ 197.7 is likely a carbonyl carbon, although its presence is unexpected based on the molecular formula C11H12O. Given the molecular formula, the presence of an epoxide is expected. The structure of compound X should be consistent with having an epoxide and an aromatic ring, along with methyl substituents. Based on the options, &#39;2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane&#39; seems to fit the data well, as it would have the aromatic signals and two methyl groups, one on the aromatic ring and one possibly on the epoxide or as a substituent on the double bond. The other options do not fit as well with the given NMR data.
