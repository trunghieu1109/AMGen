Epoxide 4 can rearrange under DABCO heating to the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone whose NMR signals (one carbonyl at \u03b4197.7; two alkene protons at \u03b46.75 and 7.68; a para-disubstituted aromatic ring showing 2H doublets at \u03b47.08 and 7.71; and two distinct methyl singlets at \u03b42.28 and 2.31) are in perfect agreement.\n\nAnswer:D)",
