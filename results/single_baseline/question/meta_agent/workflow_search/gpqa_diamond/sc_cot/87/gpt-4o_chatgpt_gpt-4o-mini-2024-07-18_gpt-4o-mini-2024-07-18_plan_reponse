            "You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?",

        "response": "In this scenario, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population indicates that the B cells are undergoing a process that increases the diversity of their antibodies. This is characteristic of somatic hypermutation, which occurs after B cell activation and leads to mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, allowing for the selection of B cells with higher affinity for the antigen. The other processes mentioned (complement activation, class switching recombination, and VDJ recombination) do not specifically account for the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene at this stage.\n\nAnswer:A",
