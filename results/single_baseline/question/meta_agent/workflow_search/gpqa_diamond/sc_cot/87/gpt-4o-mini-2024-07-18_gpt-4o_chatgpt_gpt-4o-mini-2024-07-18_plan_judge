Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question describes a scenario where tagged proteins are delivered to mice, and fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. The proliferating cells in these patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain genes. This suggests a process that increases diversity in antibody genes. Somatic hypermutation is known for introducing mutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes during an immune response, leading to high variability. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not involve gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the constant region of the antibody but not the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs earlier in B cell development to initially create diverse antibodies but does not account for high variability in proliferating cells in response to an antigen. Therefore, the process described is somatic hypermutation.
