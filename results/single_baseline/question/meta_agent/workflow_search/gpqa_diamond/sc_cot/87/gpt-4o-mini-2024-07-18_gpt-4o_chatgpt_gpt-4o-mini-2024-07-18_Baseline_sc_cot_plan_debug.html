    <pre>The question describes a scenario where tagged proteins are delivered to mice, and fluorescence is observed in Peyer&#39;s patches. The proliferating cells in these patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain genes. This suggests a process that increases diversity in antibody genes. Somatic hypermutation is known for introducing mutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes during an immune response, leading to high variability. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not involve gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the constant region of the antibody but not the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs earlier in B cell development to initially create diverse antibodies but does not account for high variability in proliferating cells in response to an antigen. Therefore, the process described is somatic hypermutation.
