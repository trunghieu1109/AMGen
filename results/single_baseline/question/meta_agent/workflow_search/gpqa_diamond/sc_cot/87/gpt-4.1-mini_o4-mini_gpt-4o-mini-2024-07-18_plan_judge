Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes from proliferating B cells in Peyer patches after antigen exposure reveals high variability due to point mutations introduced in germinal centers. This process is somatic hypermutation, which increases antibody affinity. Class switching changes constant regions, VDJ recombination occurs before antigen exposure in the bone marrow, and complement activation is an innate process, none of which create variable region diversity post-antigen.
