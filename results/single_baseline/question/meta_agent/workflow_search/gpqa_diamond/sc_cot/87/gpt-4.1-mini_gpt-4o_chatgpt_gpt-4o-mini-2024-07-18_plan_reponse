            "You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?",

        "response": "The scenario describes a process where inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and delivered to mice. The observation of fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolation of a proliferating cell population with high variability in their variable heavy chain gene suggests an adaptive immune response. High variability in the variable heavy chain gene is indicative of somatic hypermutation, which is a process that introduces mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes to increase antibody diversity and affinity for the antigen. Complement activation does not involve changes in the antibody variable region. Class switching recombination changes the constant region of the antibody, not the variable region. VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development to initially generate diverse antibodies, but the context here suggests ongoing mutation in response to antigen exposure, consistent with somatic hypermutation.\n\nAnswer:A)",
