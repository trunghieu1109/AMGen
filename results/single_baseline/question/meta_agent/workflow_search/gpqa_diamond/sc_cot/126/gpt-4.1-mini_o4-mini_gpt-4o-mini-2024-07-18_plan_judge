Question: Example(question='Which of the following molecules is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated?', choice1='4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene', choice2='5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene', choice3='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', choice4='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The substrate is a 1,5‐diene (5‐butylnona‐2,6‐diene) and on heating undergoes a Cope (3,3‐sigmatropic) rearrangement. In this rearrangement the butyl side chain effectively migrates, and when the rearranged skeleton is renumbered for the longest chain the original butyl group appears as an ethyl substituent at C-5 and a methyl substituent at C-4 on a deca‐2,6‐diene backbone. That matches 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene, choice C.
