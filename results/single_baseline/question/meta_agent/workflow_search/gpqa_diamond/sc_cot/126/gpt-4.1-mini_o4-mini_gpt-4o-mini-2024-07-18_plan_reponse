        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "The substrate is a 1,5\u2010diene (5\u2010butylnona\u20102,6\u2010diene) and on heating undergoes a Cope (3,3\u2010sigmatropic) rearrangement. In this rearrangement the butyl side chain effectively migrates, and when the rearranged skeleton is renumbered for the longest chain the original butyl group appears as an ethyl substituent at C-5 and a methyl substituent at C-4 on a deca\u20102,6\u2010diene backbone. That matches 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene, choice C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
