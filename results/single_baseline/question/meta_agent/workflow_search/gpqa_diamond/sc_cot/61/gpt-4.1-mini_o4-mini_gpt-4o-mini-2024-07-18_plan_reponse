        "response": "We need to extend ethynylcyclohexane by one carbon (methyl chloride after NaNH2 deprotonation), partially reduce to the Z\u2010alkene (Lindlar catalyst), ozonolyze the alkene to give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde, and then perform a crossed aldol (Ba(OH)2) between those two aldehydes to get the \u03b2\u2010hydroxy aldehyde 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Sequence A matches these steps.\n\nAnswer:A)",
