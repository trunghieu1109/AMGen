NaNH2, methyl chloride\n2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate\n3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n4. Ba(OH)2', choice2='1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride\n2. Li/liq. NH3\n3. O3/ H2O\n4. NH4OH', choice3='1. NaNH2, methanol\n2. Li/liq. NH3\n3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n4. NH4OH', choice4='1. NaNH2, methyl chloride\n2. H2/Pd\n3. Ba(OH)2\n3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to extend ethynylcyclohexane by one carbon (methyl chloride after NaNH2 deprotonation), partially reduce to the Z‐alkene (Lindlar catalyst), ozonolyze the alkene to give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde, and then perform a crossed aldol (Ba(OH)2) between those two aldehydes to get the β‐hydroxy aldehyde 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Sequence A matches these steps.
