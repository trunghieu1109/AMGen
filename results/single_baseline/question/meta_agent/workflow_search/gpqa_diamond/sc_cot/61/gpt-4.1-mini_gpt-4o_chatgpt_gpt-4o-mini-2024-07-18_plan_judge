proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to add a methyl group to the alkyne, reduce the alkyne to an alkene, perform ozonolysis to introduce an aldehyde group, and then form the alcohol. The correct sequence of reagents would involve using NaNH2 to deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group with methyl chloride. Then, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst) to reduce the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Next, ozonolysis with O3/(CH3)2S to form the aldehyde. Finally, a base like Ba(OH)2 to form the alcohol. This sequence matches choice 1.
