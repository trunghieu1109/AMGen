proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to consider the necessary steps for functional group transformations, including the introduction of a hydroxy group and the formation of an aldehyde. The first step typically involves deprotonation of the ethynyl group to form a nucleophile, followed by alkylation. Then, the subsequent steps would involve reduction and oxidation to achieve the desired aldehyde and hydroxy functionalities. Analyzing the given choices, we find that the correct sequence of reagents must facilitate these transformations effectively.
