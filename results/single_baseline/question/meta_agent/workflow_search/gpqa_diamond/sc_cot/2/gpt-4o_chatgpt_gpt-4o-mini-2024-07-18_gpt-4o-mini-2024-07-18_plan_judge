Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To calculate the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for the given state, we need to first find the expectation values of σ_z and σ_x. The state is a linear superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The expectation value of σ_z in this state can be calculated directly, and for σ_x, we can express it in terms of the eigenstates. After calculating both expectation values, we will combine them according to the operator to find the final expectation value.
