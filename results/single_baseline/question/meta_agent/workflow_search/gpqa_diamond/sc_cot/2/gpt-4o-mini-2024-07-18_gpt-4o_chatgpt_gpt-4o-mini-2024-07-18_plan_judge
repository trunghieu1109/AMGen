Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the operator 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x for the given state, we need to calculate the expectation values of \sigma_z and \sigma_x separately and then combine them. The state is |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{3}/2|\downarrow\rangle. The expectation value of \sigma_z is \langle\psi|\sigma_z|\psi\rangle = |0.5|^2 - |\sqrt{3}/2|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. For \sigma_x, we have \langle\psi|\sigma_x|\psi\rangle = \langle\psi|(|\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow| + |\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow|)|\psi\rangle = \langle\psi|\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow|\psi\rangle + \langle\psi|\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow|\psi\rangle = (0.5)(\sqrt{3}/2) + (\sqrt{3}/2)(0.5) = \sqrt{3}/2. Therefore, the expectation value of the operator is 10(-0.5) + 5(\sqrt{3}/2) = -5 + 5(\sqrt{3}/2) = -5 + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

Answer:-0.7
