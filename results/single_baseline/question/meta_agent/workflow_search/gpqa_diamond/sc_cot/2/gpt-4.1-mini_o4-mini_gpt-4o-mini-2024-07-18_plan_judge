Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ with a = 0.5, b = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. Expectation ⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2 − |b|^2 = 0.25 − 0.75 = −0.5; ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab = 2×0.5×0.8660 = 0.8660. Then ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10(−0.5) + 5(0.8660) = −5 + 4.3301 = −0.6699 ≈ −0.7.
