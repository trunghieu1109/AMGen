        "response": "To calculate the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z + 5\u03c3_x for the given state, we need to first find the expectation values of \u03c3_z and \u03c3_x. The state is a linear superposition of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9. The expectation value of \u03c3_z in this state can be calculated directly, and for \u03c3_x, we can express it in terms of the eigenstates. After calculating both expectation values, we will combine them according to the operator to find the final expectation value.\n\nAnswer:1.65",
