Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: First, we express the given state |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩. The operator 10σz + 5σx acts on this state. We know σz|↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. We calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩. First, calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = |0.5|^2 - |√3/2|^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Then, calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/2. So, the expectation value is 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2) = -5 + 5√3/2. Approximating √3 ≈ 1.732, 5√3/2 ≈ 4.33. Therefore, the expectation value is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.
