        "response": "To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle with the transition energy \\Delta E of the Hydrogen atom, we first need to calculate both quantities. The transition energy \\Delta E can be calculated using the formula \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \\lambda is the wavelength. For \\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m, we convert it to meters: \\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} m. The paramagnetic coupling term in a magnetic field can be estimated using the formula \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = -\\mu_B B m, where \\mu_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which we assume to be small. With B = 1 T and small m, we can find the order of magnitude of both quantities to establish their relationship.\n\nAnswer:\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E",
