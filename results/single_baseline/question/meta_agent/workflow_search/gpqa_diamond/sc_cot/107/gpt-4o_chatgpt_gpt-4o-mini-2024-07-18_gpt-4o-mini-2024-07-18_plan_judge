proposed answer: To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term \left\langle H\right\rangle with the transition energy \Delta E of the Hydrogen atom, we first need to calculate both quantities. The transition energy \Delta E can be calculated using the formula \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \lambda is the wavelength. For \lambda = 0.4861 \mu m, we convert it to meters: \lambda = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} m. The paramagnetic coupling term in a magnetic field can be estimated using the formula \left\langle H\right\rangle = -\mu_B B m, where \mu_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which we assume to be small. With B = 1 T and small m, we can find the order of magnitude of both quantities to establish their relationship.

Answer:\left\langle H\right\rangle \ll\Delta E
