Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of each component. For CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, and since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions per molecule, it contributes 0.18 moles of OH-. The net moles of OH- are 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. The moles of acetic acid are 0.05, which will react with 0.05 moles of OH- to form 0.05 moles of acetate, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- unreacted. The total volume is 1.2 L. The concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 L = 0.0417 M. The pOH is -log(0.0417) = 1.38. The pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
