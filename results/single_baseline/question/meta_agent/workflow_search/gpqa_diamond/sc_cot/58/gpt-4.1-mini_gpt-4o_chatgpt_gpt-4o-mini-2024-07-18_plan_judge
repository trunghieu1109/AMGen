Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of each component: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. Then, determine the net moles of H+ and OH- in the solution. CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid, but HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will also dissociate completely. Calculate the moles of H+ from HCl, OH- from Ba(OH)2, and consider the contribution of H+ from the dissociation of CH3COOH. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dominate the pH calculation. Calculate the total volume of the solution, and find the concentration of H+ or OH- to determine the pH.
