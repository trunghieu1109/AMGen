Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate moles of each species: CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 mol; HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+; Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH–. Neutralization: 0.08 mol H+ consume 0.08 mol OH–, leaving 0.10 mol OH–. Then OH– reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH to form 0.05 mol CH3COO–, consuming 0.05 mol OH–, leaving 0.05 mol OH– in excess. Total volume = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L, so [OH–] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M. pOH = –log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 – 1.38 = 12.62.
