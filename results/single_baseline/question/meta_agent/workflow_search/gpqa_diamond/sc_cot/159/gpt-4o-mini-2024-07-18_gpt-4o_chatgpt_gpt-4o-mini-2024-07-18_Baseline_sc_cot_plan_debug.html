    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;}

    <pre>The problem involves diffraction from an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with N approaching infinity, which essentially becomes a circular aperture. The apothems being of length &#39;a&#39; suggests that &#39;a&#39; is the radius of the circle. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by the formula theta = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since &#39;a&#39; is the radius, the diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is theta = 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)). The angular distance between the first two minima is twice this value because the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)) and the second minimum is at theta = 2 * 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)). Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is 1.22 * (lambda / a).
