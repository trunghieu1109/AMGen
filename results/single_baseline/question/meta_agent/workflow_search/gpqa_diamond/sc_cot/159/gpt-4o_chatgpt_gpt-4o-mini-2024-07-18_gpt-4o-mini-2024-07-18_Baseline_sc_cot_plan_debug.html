    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ?

    <pre>When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon approaches a circular aperture. The angular distance between the first two minima in a diffraction pattern can be derived from the formula for minima of a circular aperture, which is given by the first minimum occurring at theta = \lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. For a polygon with apothems of length a, the effective diameter relates to the apothems. The first minimum occurs at an angle that is proportional to the wavelength and inversely proportional to the aperture size. In this case, we are looking for the angular distance between the first two minima, which can be derived to be 1.220 \lambda / a based on the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.
