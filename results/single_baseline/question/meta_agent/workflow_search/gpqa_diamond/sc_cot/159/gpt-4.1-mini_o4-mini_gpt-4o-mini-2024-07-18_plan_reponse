            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "response": "As N\u2192\u221e, the N\u2010sided polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. Its far\u2010field diffraction is the Airy pattern: intensity minima occur at k\u2009a\u2009\u03b8 = zeros of J1, x1\u22483.8317 and x2\u22487.0156. With k=2\u03c0/\u03bb, \u03b8m = xm\u2009\u03bb/(2\u03c0a). Thus \u03b81\u22483.8317\u03bb/(2\u03c0a)=0.610\u03bb/a and \u03b82\u22487.0156\u03bb/(2\u03c0a)=1.116\u03bb/a. The angular separation \u0394\u03b8=\u03b82\u2212\u03b81=(7.0156\u22123.8317)\u03bb/(2\u03c0a)=0.507\u03bb/a \u22480.506\u03bb/a, so the correct choice is D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
