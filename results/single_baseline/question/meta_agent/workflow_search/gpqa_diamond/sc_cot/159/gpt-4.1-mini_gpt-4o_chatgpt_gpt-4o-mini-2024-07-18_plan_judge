Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk. The first minimum of the Airy pattern occurs at an angle given by the formula theta = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. In this case, the apothem a is related to the diameter of the circle, as the circle's radius would be a. The diameter D would be 2a. Therefore, the angle for the first minimum would be theta = 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)). The angular distance between the first two minima is essentially the angle to the first minimum, which is 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)) = 1.22 * (lambda / a).
