Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ASxc', content="As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk. The first minimum of the Airy pattern occurs at an angle given by the formula theta = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. In this case, the apothem a is related to the diameter of the circle, as the circle's radius would be a. The diameter D would be 2a. Therefore, the angle for the first minimum would be theta = 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)). The angular distance between the first two minima is essentially the angle to the first minimum, which is 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)) = 1.22 * (lambda / a).\n\nAnswer:1.220 \\lambda /a ", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
