            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "In basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic solutions due to the higher pH, which affects the reduction potential. Kinetically, reactions often proceed faster in acidic solutions due to the availability of protons (H+), which can facilitate the reaction mechanisms. Therefore, the correct combination is that thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.\n\nAnswer:A)",
