Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic solution is +1.229 V, while in basic solution (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−) it is only +0.401 V. A lower potential means a weaker oxidant thermodynamically, so in basic solutions O2 is a weaker oxidant. Kinetically, oxygen reduction is notoriously slow in acidic media due to high activation barriers. Therefore the correct fills are “weaker” and “slower,” corresponding to choice3.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 3
