            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",

            "stronger \u2013 slower",

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "In electrochemistry, oxygen is generally considered a stronger oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic ones. This is due to the higher standard reduction potential of oxygen in basic media. Kinetically, oxygen tends to react slower in acidic solutions due to the different reaction mechanisms and the presence of protons. Therefore, the correct combination is 'stronger \u2013 slower'.\n\nAnswer:B",
