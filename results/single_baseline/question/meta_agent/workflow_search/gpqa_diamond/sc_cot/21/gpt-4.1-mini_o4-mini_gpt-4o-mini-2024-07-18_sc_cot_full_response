Question: {'question': 'A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', 'choice1': 'weaker – faster', 'choice2': 'stronger – slower', 'choice3': 'weaker - slower', 'choice4': 'stronger – faster'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sBLH', content='The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic solution is +1.229 V, while in basic solution (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−) it is only +0.401 V. A lower potential means a weaker oxidant thermodynamically, so in basic solutions O2 is a weaker oxidant. Kinetically, oxygen reduction is notoriously slow in acidic media due to high activation barriers. Therefore the correct fills are “weaker” and “slower,” corresponding to choice3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
