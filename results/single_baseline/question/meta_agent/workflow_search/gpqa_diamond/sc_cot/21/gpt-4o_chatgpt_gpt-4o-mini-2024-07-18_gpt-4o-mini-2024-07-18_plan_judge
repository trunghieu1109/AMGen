Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In electrochemistry, oxygen is generally considered a stronger oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic ones. This is due to the higher standard reduction potential of oxygen in basic media. Kinetically, oxygen tends to react slower in acidic solutions due to the different reaction mechanisms and the presence of protons. Therefore, the correct combination is 'stronger – slower'.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 3
