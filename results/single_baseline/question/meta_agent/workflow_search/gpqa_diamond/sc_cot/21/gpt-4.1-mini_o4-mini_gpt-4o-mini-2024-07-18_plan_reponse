            "A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a \u2026\u2026 oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts \u2026\u2026 in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?",

            "stronger \u2013 slower",

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic solution is +1.229 V, while in basic solution (O2 + 2H2O + 4e\u2212 \u2192 4OH\u2212) it is only +0.401 V. A lower potential means a weaker oxidant thermodynamically, so in basic solutions O2 is a weaker oxidant. Kinetically, oxygen reduction is notoriously slow in acidic media due to high activation barriers. Therefore the correct fills are \u201cweaker\u201d and \u201cslower,\u201d corresponding to choice3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
