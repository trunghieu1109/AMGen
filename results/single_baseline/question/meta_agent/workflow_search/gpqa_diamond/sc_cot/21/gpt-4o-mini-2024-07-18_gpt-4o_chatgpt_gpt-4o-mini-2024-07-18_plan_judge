Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different pH environments. Thermodynamically, oxygen is generally a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. This is because the standard reduction potential for oxygen is higher in acidic conditions. However, the question asks about the thermodynamic strength in basic solutions, so we need to consider that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, reactions involving oxygen tend to be slower in acidic solutions due to the involvement of proton transfer steps which can be rate-limiting. Therefore, oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions. Thus, the correct combination is 'weaker - slower'.
