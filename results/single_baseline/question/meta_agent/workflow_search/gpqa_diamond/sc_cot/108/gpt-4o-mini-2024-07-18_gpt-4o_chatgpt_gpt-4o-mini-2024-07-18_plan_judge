Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We start with the initial state 1S0, which means S=0, L=0, and J=0. The initial parity is given by (-1)^L = +1, since L=0. The final state must have T(NN) = 0, and we must conserve angular momentum and parity. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1, so the parity of the final NN state and X together must be +1 to conserve parity, as the initial parity is +1. This means the final NN state must have parity (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) = +1, which simplifies to (-1)^L(NN) = -1, so L(NN) must be odd. We also have the condition from Pauli statistics that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Since T(NN) = 0, this gives us 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2), so S(NN) + L(NN) is odd. Let's evaluate each choice: 1) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s: Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 1 (P), so L(NN) is odd, and S(NN) + L(NN) = 2, which is even, not odd. This violates the Pauli condition. 2) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: Here, S(NN) = 3, L(NN) = 2 (D), so L(NN) is even, which violates parity conservation. 3) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f: Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 2 (D), L(NN) is even, which violates parity conservation. 4) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p: Here, S(NN) = 1, L(NN) = 0 (S), L(NN) is even, which violates parity conservation. The choice that violates the Pauli condition and is not permitted is 1).
