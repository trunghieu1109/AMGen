Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conservation laws for the system of two nucleons emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Given that the initial state is 1S0 (which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0), we need to determine which of the final states violates the requirement T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) when considering the emission of particle X. The parity of the initial state is positive, and the emitted particle X has negative parity, so the final state must have overall negative parity. We also need to ensure that the total angular momentum and parity are conserved in each case. We will evaluate each choice based on these criteria.
