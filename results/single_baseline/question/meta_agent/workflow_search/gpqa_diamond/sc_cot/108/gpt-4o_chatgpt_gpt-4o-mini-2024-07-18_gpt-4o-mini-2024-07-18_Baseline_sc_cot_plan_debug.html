    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conservation laws for the system of two nucleons emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Given that the initial state is 1S0 (which has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0), we need to determine which of the final states violates the requirement T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) when considering the emission of particle X. The parity of the initial state is positive, and the emitted particle X has negative parity, so the final state must have overall negative parity. We also need to ensure that the total angular momentum and parity are conserved in each case. We will evaluate each choice based on these criteria.
