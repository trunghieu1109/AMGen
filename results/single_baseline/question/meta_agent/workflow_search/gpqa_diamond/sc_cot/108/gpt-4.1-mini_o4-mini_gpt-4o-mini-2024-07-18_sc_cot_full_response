Question: {'question': 'Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', 'choice1': '1S0 -> 3P0 + s', 'choice2': '1S0 -> 7D1 + p', 'choice3': '1S0 -> 3D3 + f', 'choice4': '1S0 -> 3S1 + p'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent YEBh', content="Initial state: NN in 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0, parity = +1. Emitting X (P = –1) with relative orbital ℓ_x. Final NN in state (2S'+1)L'_J' with parity = (–1)^L'. Conservation of J: J' = ℓ_x. Parity conservation: 1 = (–1)^L'·(–1)·(–1)^ℓ_x → L'+ℓ_x must be odd. Pauli: for T(NN)=0, require S'+L' odd. Check each: 1) 3P0+ s: S'+L'=1+1=2 (even) violates Pauli → forbidden. Others satisfy all constraints.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
