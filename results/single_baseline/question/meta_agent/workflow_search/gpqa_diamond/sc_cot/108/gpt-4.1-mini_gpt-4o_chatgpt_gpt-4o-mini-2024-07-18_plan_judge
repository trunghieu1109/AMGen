Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1.

proposed answer: We start with a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state, meaning the initial state has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, and total angular momentum J = 0. The intrinsic parity of the particle X is -1. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). For each choice, we need to check isospin T(NN), spin S(NN), and orbital angular momentum L(NN) of the final state, ensuring T(NN) = 0 and conservation laws are satisfied. 

1. For choice 1 (1S0 -> 3P0 + s): Final NN state is 3P0, meaning S = 1, L = 1, J = 0. The emitted particle X has l = 0 (s-wave). Parity is (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l = (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 = -1. T(NN) = 0. S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is consistent with T(NN) = 0 mod 2.

2. For choice 2 (1S0 -> 7D1 + p): Final NN state is 7D1, meaning S = 3, L = 2, J = 1. The emitted particle X has l = 1 (p-wave). Parity is (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l = (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = -1. T(NN) = 0. S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5, which is not consistent with T(NN) = 0 mod 2.

3. For choice 3 (1S0 -> 3D3 + f): Final NN state is 3D3, meaning S = 1, L = 2, J = 3. The emitted particle X has l = 3 (f-wave). Parity is (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l = (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 = -1. T(NN) = 0. S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3, which is not consistent with T(NN) = 0 mod 2.

4. For choice 4 (1S0 -> 3S1 + p): Final NN state is 3S1, meaning S = 1, L = 0, J = 1. The emitted particle X has l = 1 (p-wave). Parity is (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)^l = (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = -1. T(NN) = 0. S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1, which is consistent with T(NN) = 0 mod 2.

Choices 2 and 3 do not satisfy the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Choice 2 is the only one that violates both angular momentum and parity conservation laws.
