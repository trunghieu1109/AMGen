        "response": "We need to rank para\u2010isomer yield for bromination by substituent directing effects: strong meta directors give minimal p, then weak deactivating ortho/para director (Cl), then activating ortho/para directors (alkyl). Nitro (4) gives almost no p, then benzoic acid (6) and ethyl benzoate (2) give small p, then chlorobenzene (3) gives moderate p, then toluene (1) then ethylbenzene (5) highest. Among choices, only choice 2 (4<2<6<3<1<5) approximates this ordering (ester and acid small difference can swap), so choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
