    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to understand the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents can be either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. Ortho/para-directors are typically electron-donating groups, while meta-directors are electron-withdrawing groups. The more electron-donating a group is, the more it favors ortho and para positions, with para often being more favored in bulky groups due to steric hindrance. The order of para-isomer yield will depend on the directing effects of these substituents. Let&#39;s analyze each:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): CH3 is an ortho/para-director due to its electron-donating nature through hyperconjugation.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The ester group is a meta-director due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Cl is an ortho/para-director, but it is weakly deactivating.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): NO2 is a strong meta-director due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): C2H5 is similar to CH3, an ortho/para-director.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): COOH is a meta-director due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering the directing effects, the order of increasing para-isomer yield should be based on the strength of the ortho/para-directing effect. Meta-directors will have the least para-isomer yield, and among ortho/para-directors, the more electron-donating, the higher the para-isomer yield.

4) C6H5-NO2 is the strongest meta-director, so it will have the lowest para-isomer yield.
6) C6H5-COOH is also a meta-director, so it will have low para-isomer yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 is a meta-director, but less strong than NO2, so it will have more para-isomer yield than 4.
1) C6H5-CH3 is an ortho/para-director, so it will have more para-isomer yield than meta-directors.
5) C6H5-C2H5 is similar to CH3, but slightly bulkier, so it may have more para-isomer yield than CH3.
3) C6H5-Cl is a weak ortho/para-director, but it is less activating than alkyl groups, so it may have more para-isomer yield than meta-directors but less than alkyl groups.

Therefore, the order should be 4 &lt; 6 &lt; 2 &lt; 1 &lt; 5 &lt; 3.
