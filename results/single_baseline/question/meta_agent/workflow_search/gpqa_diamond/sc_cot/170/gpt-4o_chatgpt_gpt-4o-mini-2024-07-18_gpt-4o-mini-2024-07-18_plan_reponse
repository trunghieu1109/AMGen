        "response": "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by whether the substituent is an electron-donating group (EDG) or an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). EDGs tend to direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, while EWGs direct them to the meta position. The strength of the substituents also affects the yield of the para isomer. Substituents like -NO2 are strong EWGs and will have low yields of para, while -CH3 and -C2H5 are strong EDGs and will favor the para position. The order can be derived from the nature of the substituents and their directing effects. After analyzing the substituents, we can conclude that the correct order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is given by choice 4: 4<6<2<1<5<3.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
