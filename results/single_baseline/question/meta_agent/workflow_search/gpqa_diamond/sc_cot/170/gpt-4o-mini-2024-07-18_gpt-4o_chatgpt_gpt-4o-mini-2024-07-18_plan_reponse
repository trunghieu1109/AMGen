        "response": "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups like alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5) are ortho/para-directing, while deactivating groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta-directing. Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The stronger the ortho/para-directing effect, the higher the yield of the para-isomer. Conversely, meta-directing groups will have lower para-isomer yields. Based on this, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield is determined by the strength of the directing effects.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3",
