Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MqKR', content='The product’s stereocenter at C4 derives directly from the preexisting C3 stereocenter of the starting β-keto acid (the reduction and lactonization don’t invert it). To obtain (R)-4-ethyl in reaction A, starting material A must be (R) at C3; to obtain (S)-4-ethyl in reaction B, starting material B must be (S) at C3. That corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
