Question: Example(question='A chemist performed two reactions by taking two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. Select the proper starting material for both of the reactions.\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one', choice1='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice2='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice3='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice4='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The product’s stereocenter at C4 derives directly from the preexisting C3 stereocenter of the starting β-keto acid (the reduction and lactonization don’t invert it). To obtain (R)-4-ethyl in reaction A, starting material A must be (R) at C3; to obtain (S)-4-ethyl in reaction B, starting material B must be (S) at C3. That corresponds to choice 4.
