Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question lists four potential sources of subtle errors in genomics analyses: incompatible data formats, “chr”/no-“chr” mismatches, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions. In practice, improper data formats often trigger immediate errors or warnings, making them easier to catch. The harder-to-spot issues are the three that can silently misalign or mislabel data: prefix mismatches (chr/no chr), using the wrong genome assembly, and misconverted gene or transcript IDs. Those correspond to choices 2, 3, and 4, i.e. choice4.
