        "response": "To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, let's evaluate each option: \n1. Mutually incompatible data formats: This can cause errors but is often caught early due to format checks. \n2. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion: This is a common issue where the presence or absence of 'chr' in chromosome names causes mismatches. \n3. Reference assembly mismatch: Using different versions of reference genomes can lead to significant errors in analysis. \n4. Incorrect ID conversion: Errors in converting between different gene or protein IDs can lead to misinterpretation of data. \nAll these issues are indeed common and can lead to difficult-to-spot errors. Therefore, the most comprehensive choice is 'All of the above'.\n\nAnswer:C)",
