Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to consider each option:

1. Mutually incompatible data formats: This is a common issue as different tools and databases use different formats, leading to potential errors if not properly converted.

2. The "chr" / "no chr" confusion: This refers to the difference in chromosome naming conventions, such as 'chr1' vs '1'. This is a common source of errors when integrating data from different sources.

3. Reference assembly mismatch: This occurs when different reference genome versions are used, leading to misalignment and incorrect results. It is a significant source of errors.

4. Incorrect ID conversion: This involves errors in converting identifiers (e.g., gene IDs), which can lead to incorrect data interpretation.

Considering all these points, all the issues mentioned are common sources of errors in genomics data analysis. Therefore, the choice that includes all of them would be the most comprehensive answer.
