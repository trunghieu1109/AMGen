Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to consider each option provided. The issues listed are all known to cause errors in data analysis. 'Mutually incompatible data formats' can lead to data loss or misinterpretation. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion can result in misalignment of genomic data. A 'Reference assembly mismatch' can cause significant errors in variant calling. 'Incorrect ID conversion' can lead to misidentification of genes or variants. Since all of these issues can contribute to errors, the correct choice that encompasses all these problems would be 'All of the above'.
