Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, let's evaluate each option: 
1. Mutually incompatible data formats: This can cause errors but is often caught early due to format checks. 
2. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion: This is a common issue where the presence or absence of 'chr' in chromosome names causes mismatches. 
3. Reference assembly mismatch: Using different versions of reference genomes can lead to significant errors in analysis. 
4. Incorrect ID conversion: Errors in converting between different gene or protein IDs can lead to misinterpretation of data. 
All these issues are indeed common and can lead to difficult-to-spot errors. Therefore, the most comprehensive choice is 'All of the above'.
