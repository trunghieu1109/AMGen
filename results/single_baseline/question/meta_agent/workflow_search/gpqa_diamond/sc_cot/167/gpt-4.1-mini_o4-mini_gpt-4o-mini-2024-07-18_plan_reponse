In practice, improper data formats often trigger immediate errors or warnings, making them easier to catch. The harder-to-spot issues are the three that can silently misalign or mislabel data: prefix mismatches (chr/no chr), using the wrong genome assembly, and misconverted gene or transcript IDs. Those correspond to choices 2, 3, and 4, i.e. choice4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
