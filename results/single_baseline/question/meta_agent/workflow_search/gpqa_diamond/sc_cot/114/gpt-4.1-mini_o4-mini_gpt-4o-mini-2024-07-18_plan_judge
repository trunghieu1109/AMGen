Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have an electron (γₑ=4, βₑ=√15/4) moving right and a positron (γₚ=2, βₚ=√3/2) moving left that annihilate into two photons. Total lab‐frame energy is Eₜ= (γₑ+γₚ)mc² =6mc², total momentum P=mc(γₑβₑ−γₚβₚ)=mc(√15−√3). Each photon has equal energy E=Eₜ/2=3mc² and momentum p=3mc. Let photons be emitted at ±θ to the x-axis. Their net momentum is 2p cosθ in x, so 2·3mc·cosθ = mc(√15−√3), giving cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.357 ⇒ θ≈69°. The angle between them is 2θ≈138°.
