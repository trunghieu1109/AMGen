            "An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity. The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is related to the velocity by \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\). For the electron, \\( \\gamma = 4 \\) means \\( v_e = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}c \\), and for the positron, \\( \\gamma = 2 \\) means \\( v_p = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}c \\). The total energy of the system before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron: \\( E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2 \\). After annihilation, this energy is carried by two photons, each with energy \\( 3m_e c^2 \\). Since one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, their momentum components must cancel vertically, meaning they have equal and opposite vertical components. Let \\( \\theta \\) be the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The horizontal momentum components add up to the initial total momentum, and the vertical components cancel. Using \\( E = pc \\) for photons, the horizontal momentum for each is \\( 3m_e c \\cos(\\theta) \\). The initial momentum is \\( p_{\\text{initial}} = \\gamma_e m_e v_e - \\gamma_p m_e v_p \\). Solving for \\( \\theta \\), we find \\( \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\gamma_e v_e - \\gamma_p v_p}{2c} \\). Substituting the velocities, \\( \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} \\). Solving for \\( \\theta \\), we find \\( \\theta \\approx 69^\\circ \\). Therefore, the angle between the directions of the photons is \\( 2\\theta \\approx 138^\\circ \\).\n\nAnswer:C)",
