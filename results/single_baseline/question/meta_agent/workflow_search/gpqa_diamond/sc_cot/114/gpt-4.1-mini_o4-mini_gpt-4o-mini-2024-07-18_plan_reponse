            "An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?",

        "response": "We have an electron (\u03b3\u2091=4, \u03b2\u2091=\u221a15/4) moving right and a positron (\u03b3\u209a=2, \u03b2\u209a=\u221a3/2) moving left that annihilate into two photons. Total lab\u2010frame energy is E\u209c= (\u03b3\u2091+\u03b3\u209a)mc\u00b2 =6mc\u00b2, total momentum P=mc(\u03b3\u2091\u03b2\u2091\u2212\u03b3\u209a\u03b2\u209a)=mc(\u221a15\u2212\u221a3). Each photon has equal energy E=E\u209c/2=3mc\u00b2 and momentum p=3mc. Let photons be emitted at \u00b1\u03b8 to the x-axis. Their net momentum is 2p\u2009cos\u03b8 in x, so 2\u00b73mc\u00b7cos\u03b8 = mc(\u221a15\u2212\u221a3), giving cos\u03b8=(\u221a15\u2212\u221a3)/6\u22480.357 \u21d2 \u03b8\u224869\u00b0. The angle between them is 2\u03b8\u2248138\u00b0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
