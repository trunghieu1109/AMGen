    <pre>We have an electron (γₑ=4, βₑ=√15/4) moving right and a positron (γₚ=2, βₚ=√3/2) moving left that annihilate into two photons. Total lab‐frame energy is Eₜ= (γₑ+γₚ)mc² =6mc², total momentum P=mc(γₑβₑ−γₚβₚ)=mc(√15−√3). Each photon has equal energy E=Eₜ/2=3mc² and momentum p=3mc. Let photons be emitted at ±θ to the x-axis. Their net momentum is 2p cosθ in x, so 2·3mc·cosθ = mc(√15−√3), giving cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.357 ⇒ θ≈69°. The angle between them is 2θ≈138°.
