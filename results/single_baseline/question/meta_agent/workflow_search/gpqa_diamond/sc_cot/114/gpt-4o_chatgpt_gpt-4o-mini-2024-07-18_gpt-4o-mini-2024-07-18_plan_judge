Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In a collision between an electron and a positron, the annihilation produces two photons that move in opposite directions. The problem states that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. This suggests that the photons are emitted at an angle with respect to the horizontal axis. To find the angle between the two photons, we can visualize the situation: one photon is moving at an angle θ above the horizontal, and the other is moving at an angle θ below the horizontal. The total angle between the two directions of the photons would then be 2θ. Given that the photons are moving in opposite vertical directions, we can deduce that the angle between them is 180 degrees minus the angle of elevation of each photon. However, since the problem gives specific choices, we can calculate the angle directly from the options provided. The angle between the two directions of the photons is 180 degrees minus the angle difference they make with the horizontal axis. Since the photons are emitted symmetrically, we can conclude that the angle between them is 180 degrees minus the angle above the horizontal. The correct choice from the options given that fits this scenario is 138 degrees, which corresponds to the angle between the two photons moving in opposite vertical directions.
