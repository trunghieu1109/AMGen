    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy during the annihilation of the electron and positron. The Lorentz factor for the electron is 4, which implies its velocity is v_e = sqrt(1 - (1/4)^2)c = 0.968c. The Lorentz factor for the positron is 2, which implies its velocity is v_p = sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2)c = 0.866c. Both particles collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Since the photons have the same energy and are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, the angle between their directions can be determined by considering the symmetry and conservation of momentum. The angle between the photons must be 96 degrees to satisfy these conditions.
