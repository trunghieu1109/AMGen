proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the dipole transition rules in the hydrogen atom. The selection rules for dipole transitions are \Delta l = \pm 1 and \Delta m = 0, \pm 1. The initial state is |3,0,0\rangle, and the final state is |1,0,0\rangle. We need to find a sequence of two dipole transitions that satisfy these rules. Starting from |3,0,0\rangle, the first transition must go to an n=2 state with l=1 (since \Delta l = 1). The possible states are |2,1,-1\rangle, |2,1,0\rangle, and |2,1,1\rangle. From |2,1,0\rangle, the only allowed transition to n=1 is to |1,0,0\rangle. Therefore, the correct sequence is |3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle. According to the choices, this corresponds to choice 2, and the probability given is \frac{1}{3}.
