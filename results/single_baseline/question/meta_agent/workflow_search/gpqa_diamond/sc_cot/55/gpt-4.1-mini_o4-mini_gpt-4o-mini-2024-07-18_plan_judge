proposed answer: We’re asked for the allowed two‐step dipole decay paths from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.  The electric‐dipole selection rules are Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1.  From the initial s‐state (l=0,m=0) the only allowed first step is to a p‐state: |2,1,m⟩ with m=0,±1.  Then each of those p‐states can decay to the final s‐state (l=0,m=0) via Δm=0,±1.  If one restricts to Δm=0 transitions (e.g. for z‐polarized photons) then the only nonzero branch is via |2,1,0⟩.  The single‐step branching ratio from m=0→m′=0 is 1/3, and similarly for the second step, giving a net probability of (1/3)(1)=1/3 for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩.  This matches choice B.
