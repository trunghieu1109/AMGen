        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the dipole transition rules in the hydrogen atom. The selection rules for dipole transitions are \\Delta l = \\pm 1 and \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1. The initial state is |3,0,0\\rangle, and the final state is |1,0,0\\rangle. We need to find a sequence of two dipole transitions that satisfy these rules. Starting from |3,0,0\\rangle, the first transition must go to an n=2 state with l=1 (since \\Delta l = 1). The possible states are |2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, and |2,1,1\\rangle. From |2,1,0\\rangle, the only allowed transition to n=1 is to |1,0,0\\rangle. Therefore, the correct sequence is |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle. According to the choices, this corresponds to choice 2, and the probability given is \\frac{1}{3}.\n\nAnswer:B)",
