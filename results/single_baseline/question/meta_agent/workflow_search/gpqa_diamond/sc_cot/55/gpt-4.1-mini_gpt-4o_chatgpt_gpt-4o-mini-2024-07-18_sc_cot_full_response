Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent aCI2', content='For the hydrogen atom, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are \\Delta l = \\pm 1 and \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1. Starting from the |3,0,0\\rangle state, the possible transitions are to |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, or |2,1,-1\\rangle. From the |2,1,0\\rangle state, the transition to |1,0,0\\rangle is allowed. The probability of the transition from |3,0,0\\rangle to |2,1,0\\rangle is 1/3, and from |2,1,0\\rangle to |1,0,0\\rangle is 1. Therefore, the overall probability is 1/3.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
