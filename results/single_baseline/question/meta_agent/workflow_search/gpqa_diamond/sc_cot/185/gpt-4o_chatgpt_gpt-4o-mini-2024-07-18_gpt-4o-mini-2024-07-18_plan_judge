Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Cope rearrangement involves the migration of double bonds and can lead to various products depending on the structure of the starting material. For (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, we need to analyze the stereochemistry and the possible shifts of the double bonds during the rearrangement to identify the correct product. The options provided represent different tetrahydro derivatives of cyclopenta[c]pyridine, and we need to determine which one corresponds to the rearrangement of the given starting compound.

Answer:4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
Extracted answer: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
Correct answer: 1
