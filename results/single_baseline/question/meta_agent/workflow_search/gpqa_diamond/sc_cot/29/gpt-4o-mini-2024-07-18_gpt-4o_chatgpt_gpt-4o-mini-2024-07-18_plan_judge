Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the color of light absorbed by the dye, we need to understand the relationship between the absorbed and emitted light. The dye emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. The color of the emitted light corresponds to this energy. We must recall that the color absorbed is complementary to the color emitted. First, we convert the energy of the emitted light to its corresponding wavelength using the formula E = hc/Î», where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Then, we determine the color of light with this wavelength. Finally, we find the complementary color, which is the color absorbed.
