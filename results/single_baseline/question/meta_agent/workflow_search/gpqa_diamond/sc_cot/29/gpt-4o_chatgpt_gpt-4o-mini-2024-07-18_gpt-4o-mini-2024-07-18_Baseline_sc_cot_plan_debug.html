    <pre>The energy of the absorbed light corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state of the dye. The energy of light is related to its wavelength and color. Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths and colors like violet and blue, while lower energy corresponds to longer wavelengths and colors like yellow and red. Since 2.3393 eV is relatively high, it suggests that the color absorbed would be in the blue to violet range. Therefore, the absorbed color would likely be the complementary color of the emitted light, which is blue.
