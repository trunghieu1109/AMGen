Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Convert the photon energy to wavelength: λ (nm)=1240 eV·nm/E (eV)=1240/2.3393≈530 nm, which lies in the green–yellow region. The closest choice given is “Yellow.”

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 3
