Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Awku', content="The energy of the absorbed light can be calculated using the complementary color of the emitted light. The emitted light has an energy of 2.3393 eV. The wavelength of light can be calculated using the formula: E = hc/位, where h is Planck's constant (4.135667696 x 10^-15 eV路s) and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). Solving for 位 gives 位 = hc/E. Substituting the given energy, we find the wavelength of the emitted light. The absorbed light is the complementary color, which can be found on the color wheel. Typically, if a compound emits light of a certain color, it absorbs the complementary color. The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm, which is green light. Therefore, the absorbed light would be the complementary color of green, which is red.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
