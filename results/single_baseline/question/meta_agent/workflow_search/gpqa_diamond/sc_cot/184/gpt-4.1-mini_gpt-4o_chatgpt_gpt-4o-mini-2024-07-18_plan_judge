proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given by H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}, where \vec{n} is a unit vector and \vec{\sigma} are the Pauli matrices. The expression \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n} is a dot product, which can be written as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. Since \vec{n} is a unit vector, \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n} is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues +1 and -1). Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}) are simply \varepsilon times the eigenvalues of \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}, which are +\varepsilon and -\varepsilon.
