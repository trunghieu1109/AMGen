        "response": "The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined from the properties of the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues \u00b11. Therefore, when we scale by the constant \u03b5, the eigenvalues of H will be \u00b1\u03b5. Thus, the correct choice is the one that reflects this scaling.\n\nAnswer:+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon",
