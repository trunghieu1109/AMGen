Question: Example(question='Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?', choice1='Cold molecular interstellar medium.', choice2='Cold atomic interstellar medium.', choice3='Warm atomic interstellar medium.', choice4='Warm molecular interstellar medium.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We’re detecting an absorption line at 3.9×10⁻⁶ eV from structures at ∼2.1 Gpc. The only common Galactic line at that energy is the H I 21 cm hyperfine transition (E≈5.9×10⁻⁶ eV); redshift can lower it to ∼3.9 μeV. This line traces neutral atomic hydrogen, and absorption is strongest in the cold atomic (CNM) phase, where the spin temperature is low enough to produce measurable absorption.
