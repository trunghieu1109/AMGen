            "Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?",
            "Cold molecular interstellar medium.",
            "Cold atomic interstellar medium.",

        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "The absorption line energy of 3.9 micro electron volts suggests that we are observing very low-energy transitions, which are typically associated with cold atomic or molecular regions in space. Given the context of the Milky Way and the choices provided, the cold molecular interstellar medium is a likely candidate for such low-energy transitions due to its density and temperature characteristics.\n\nAnswer:A",
