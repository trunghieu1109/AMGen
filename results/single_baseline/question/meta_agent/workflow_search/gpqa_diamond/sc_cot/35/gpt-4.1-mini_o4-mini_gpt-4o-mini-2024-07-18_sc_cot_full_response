Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent KWrQ', content='We’re detecting an absorption line at 3.9×10⁻⁶ eV from structures at ∼2.1 Gpc. The only common Galactic line at that energy is the H I 21 cm hyperfine transition (E≈5.9×10⁻⁶ eV); redshift can lower it to ∼3.9 μeV. This line traces neutral atomic hydrogen, and absorption is strongest in the cold atomic (CNM) phase, where the spin temperature is low enough to produce measurable absorption.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
