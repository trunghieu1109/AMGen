    <pre>The absorption line energy given is 3.9 micro electron volts, which is a very low energy level. In the Milky Way, low energy absorption lines are typically associated with cold environments because lower energy transitions correspond to lower temperatures. The cold molecular interstellar medium (ISM) is known to have low energy transitions, such as those involving rotational transitions of molecules like CO (carbon monoxide), which occur at microwave frequencies and correspond to very low energies. Cold atomic ISM typically involves hydrogen and has the 21 cm line, which is also low energy, but the molecular ISM is more commonly associated with these very low energy transitions. Therefore, the most likely observation with this absorption line in the Milky Way is the cold molecular interstellar medium.
