The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?",

The only common Galactic line at that energy is the H I 21 cm hyperfine transition (E\u22485.9\u00d710\u207b\u2076 eV); redshift can lower it to \u223c3.9 \u03bceV. This line traces neutral atomic hydrogen, and absorption is strongest in the cold atomic (CNM) phase, where the spin temperature is low enough to produce measurable absorption.\n\nAnswer:B)",
