        "response": "To find the energy of the nucleus X (which is a lithium nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6) moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 times the atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 6 * 931.5 MeV/c^2 = 5589 MeV/c^2. The relativistic energy is given by E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. For v = 0.96c, \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 3.5714. Therefore, the energy E = \u03b3mc^2 = 3.5714 * 5589 MeV = 19948 MeV = 19.948 GeV. However, since the choices are around 20 GeV, and the precision is 1e-4, we should consider the closest option. Therefore, the closest energy is 20.132 GeV.\n\nAnswer:B)",
