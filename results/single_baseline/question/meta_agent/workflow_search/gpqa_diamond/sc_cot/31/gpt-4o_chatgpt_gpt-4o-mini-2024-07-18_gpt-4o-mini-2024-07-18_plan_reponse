        "response": "To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. The total energy E can be calculated using the formula E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. First, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3 for the speed of 0.96c, which is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). After calculating \u03b3, we can determine the rest mass of the lithium nucleus and then compute the total energy. We will compare the calculated energy with the provided choices to find the closest match.\n\nAnswer:B",
