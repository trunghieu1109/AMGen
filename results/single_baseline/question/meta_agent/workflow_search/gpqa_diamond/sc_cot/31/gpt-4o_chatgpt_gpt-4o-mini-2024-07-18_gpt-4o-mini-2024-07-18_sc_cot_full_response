Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent yai1', content='To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. The total energy E can be calculated using the formula E = γmc^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. First, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ for the speed of 0.96c, which is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). After calculating γ, we can determine the rest mass of the lithium nucleus and then compute the total energy. We will compare the calculated energy with the provided choices to find the closest match.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
