Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need the total energy E = γm₀c² for a Li nucleus with 3 neutrons (Li-6). γ = 1/√(1−0.96²) = 1/√(1−0.9216) = 1/√0.0784 = 3.5714. The rest mass m₀ of Li-6 nucleus ≈ (6.015122 u − 3×0.0005486 u)×931.5 MeV/u ≈ 5.60 GeV. Thus E ≈ 3.5714×5.60 GeV ≈ 20.0 GeV. Among the choices, 20.132 GeV is the closest.
