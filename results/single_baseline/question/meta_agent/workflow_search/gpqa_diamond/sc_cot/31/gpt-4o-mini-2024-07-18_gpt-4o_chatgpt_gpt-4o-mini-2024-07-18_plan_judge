Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the energy of the nucleus X (which is a lithium nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6) moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 times the atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 6 * 931.5 MeV/c^2 = 5589 MeV/c^2. The relativistic energy is given by E = γmc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. For v = 0.96c, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 3.5714. Therefore, the energy E = γmc^2 = 3.5714 * 5589 MeV = 19948 MeV = 19.948 GeV. However, since the choices are around 20 GeV, and the precision is 1e-4, we should consider the closest option. Therefore, the closest energy is 20.132 GeV.
