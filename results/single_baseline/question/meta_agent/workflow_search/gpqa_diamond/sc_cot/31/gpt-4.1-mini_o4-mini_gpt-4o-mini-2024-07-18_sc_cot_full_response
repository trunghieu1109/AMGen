Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 0Ypb', content='We need the total energy E = γm₀c² for a Li nucleus with 3 neutrons (Li-6). γ = 1/√(1−0.96²) = 1/√(1−0.9216) = 1/√0.0784 = 3.5714. The rest mass m₀ of Li-6 nucleus ≈ (6.015122\u2009u − 3×0.0005486\u2009u)×931.5\u2009MeV/u ≈ 5.60\u2009GeV. Thus E ≈ 3.5714×5.60\u2009GeV ≈ 20.0\u2009GeV. Among the choices, 20.132\u2009GeV is the closest.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
