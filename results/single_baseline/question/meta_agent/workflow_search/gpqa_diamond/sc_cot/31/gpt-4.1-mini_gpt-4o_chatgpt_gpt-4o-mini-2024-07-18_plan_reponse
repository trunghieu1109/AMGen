        "response": "To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at 0.96c, we first need to calculate the Lorentz factor (\u03b3), which is given by \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). For v = 0.96c, \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 3.57. The nucleus X is lithium-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons), with an atomic mass of approximately 6 u (atomic mass units). The rest mass energy of lithium-6 is about 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV. The total energy E is given by E = \u03b3 * m_0 * c^2, where m_0 is the rest mass. Thus, E = 3.57 * 5.589 GeV = 19.958 GeV. The closest choice to this calculated energy is 20.132 GeV.\n\nAnswer:B)",
