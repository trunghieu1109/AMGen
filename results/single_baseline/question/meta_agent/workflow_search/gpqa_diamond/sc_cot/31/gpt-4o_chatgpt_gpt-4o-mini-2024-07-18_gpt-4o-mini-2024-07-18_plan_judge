Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) at a speed of 0.96c, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. The total energy E can be calculated using the formula E = γmc^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. First, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ for the speed of 0.96c, which is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). After calculating γ, we can determine the rest mass of the lithium nucleus and then compute the total energy. We will compare the calculated energy with the provided choices to find the closest match.
