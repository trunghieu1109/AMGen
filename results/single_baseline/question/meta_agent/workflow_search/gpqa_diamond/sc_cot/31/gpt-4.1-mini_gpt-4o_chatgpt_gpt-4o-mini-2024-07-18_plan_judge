Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the energy of the nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at 0.96c, we first need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). For v = 0.96c, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 3.57. The nucleus X is lithium-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons), with an atomic mass of approximately 6 u (atomic mass units). The rest mass energy of lithium-6 is about 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV. The total energy E is given by E = γ * m_0 * c^2, where m_0 is the rest mass. Thus, E = 3.57 * 5.589 GeV = 19.958 GeV. The closest choice to this calculated energy is 20.132 GeV.
