Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, compute apparent magnitudes for each star, then compare to ESPRESSO’s rough limiting magnitude of V≈15 for S/N≥10 in a 1 h exposure on one 8 m UT.

a) Canopus: V=–0.7 ⇒ easily detectable.
b) Polaris: V≈2.0 ⇒ easily detectable.
c) M_V=15 at 10 pc ⇒ m=15+5log10(10/10)=15 ⇒ detectable (S/N≈10).
d) M_V=15 at 200 pc ⇒ m=15+5log10(200/10)=15+6.5≈21.5 ⇒ too faint.
e) M_V=15 at 5 pc ⇒ m=15+5log10(5/10)=15–1.5≈13.5 ⇒ detectable.
f) M_V=15 at 50 pc ⇒ m=15+5log10(50/10)=15+3.5≈18.5 ⇒ too faint.

Detectable: a, b, c, e ⇒ 4 stars.
