proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and check if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved during a 1-hour exposure. 

For Canopus and Polaris, these are bright stars with apparent magnitudes much brighter than the threshold for detectability with ESPRESSO, so they are detectable.

For the stars with given absolute magnitudes and distances, we calculate the apparent magnitude using the formula: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.

c) Star at 10 pc, M = 15: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15.

d) Star at 200 pc, M = 15: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(200) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (2.301 - 1) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.

e) Star at 5 pc, M = 15: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (0.699 - 1) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.

f) Star at 50 pc, M = 15: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (1.699 - 1) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is capable of detecting stars with apparent magnitudes up to around 16-17 in a 1-hour exposure for S/N > 10.

Based on these calculations:
- Canopus and Polaris are detectable.
- Star at 10 pc (m = 15) is detectable.
- Star at 5 pc (m = 13.495) is detectable.
- Stars at 50 pc (m = 18.495) and 200 pc (m = 21.505) are not detectable.

Thus, 4 stars are detectable.
