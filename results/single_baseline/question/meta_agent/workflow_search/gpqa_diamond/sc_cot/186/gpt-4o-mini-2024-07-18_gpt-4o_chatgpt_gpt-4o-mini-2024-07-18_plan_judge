proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and see if it would result in a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT can achieve high precision, but the detectability will depend on the apparent brightness of the star. 

First, let's consider the stars:

- a) Canopus: Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of -0.74. It is very bright and easily detectable.

- b) Polaris: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of around 1.98. It is also quite bright and detectable.

- c) Star with Absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 10 pc: Using the distance modulus formula, m - M = 5 log10(d) - 5, where m is the apparent magnitude, M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs, we find m = 15 + 5 log10(10) - 5 = 15. This star is faint, but since it is at 10 pc, it might be detectable.

- d) Star with Absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 200 pc: Using the distance modulus, m = 15 + 5 log10(200) - 5 = 20.51. This star is very faint and likely not detectable.

- e) Star with Absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 5 pc: Using the distance modulus, m = 15 + 5 log10(5) - 5 = 13.5. This star is brighter than the one at 10 pc and might be detectable.

- f) Star with Absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 50 pc: Using the distance modulus, m = 15 + 5 log10(50) - 5 = 19.5. This star is faint and likely not detectable.

Stars a, b, c, and e are potentially detectable given their apparent magnitudes, while d and f are too faint at their respective distances. Therefore, the number of detectable stars is 4.
