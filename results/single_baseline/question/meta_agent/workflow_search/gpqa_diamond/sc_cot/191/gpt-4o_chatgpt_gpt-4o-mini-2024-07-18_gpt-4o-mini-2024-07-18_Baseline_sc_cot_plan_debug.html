    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$.

    <pre>To find the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor, we need to consider the properties of conductors and electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged and there is a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor will respond by inducing a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. By Gauss&#39;s law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the conductor, where L &gt; R, can be treated as if the total charge +q were at the center. The electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant. Since we are considering the distance L from the center of the conductor, the electric field at that point will be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L^2). Thus, the correct choice from the options provided is choice 4.
