Question: {'question': 'Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wrvx', content="The problem involves a charged cavity inside an uncharged conductor. By Gauss's Law, the charge inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity, and the outer surface of the conductor gains a total charge of +q. Since the conductor is spherical and the charge is uniformly distributed, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is determined by the total charge +q at the center of the conductor. The electric field at distance L from the center of the conductor is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge.\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
