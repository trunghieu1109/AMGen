Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pQjz', content="To find the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor, we need to consider the properties of conductors and electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged and there is a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor will respond by inducing a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. By Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the conductor, where L > R, can be treated as if the total charge +q were at the center. The electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant. Since we are considering the distance L from the center of the conductor, the electric field at that point will be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L^2). Thus, the correct choice from the options provided is choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
