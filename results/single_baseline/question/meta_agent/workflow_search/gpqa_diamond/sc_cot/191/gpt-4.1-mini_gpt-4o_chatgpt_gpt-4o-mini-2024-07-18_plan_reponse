            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",
            "$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n",

        "response": "The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity of a conductor. By electrostatic shielding, the conductor will have induced charges such that the electric field inside the conductor (outside the cavity) is zero. However, outside the conductor, the entire system can be treated as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor due to electrostatic induction. Therefore, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge +q and the distance from the center of the conductor, not the actual position of the charge inside the cavity. The electric field at a point outside the conductor is given by the field due to a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. Hence, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, is given by the formula for the electric field due to a point charge: E = (1/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_o)) (q/L^2).\n\nAnswer:D)",
