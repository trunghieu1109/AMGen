            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",

        "response": "To find the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor, we need to consider the properties of conductors and electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged and there is a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor will respond by inducing a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. By Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the conductor, where L > R, can be treated as if the total charge +q were at the center. The electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant. Since we are considering the distance L from the center of the conductor, the electric field at that point will be E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * (q / L^2). Thus, the correct choice from the options provided is choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D",
