            "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?",

        "response": "Klinefelter's syndrome is a result of an extra X chromosome in males (XXY instead of XY), while Down's syndrome is due to an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are less prominent because of a process called X-chromosome inactivation, where one of the extra X chromosomes in each cell becomes inactivated and forms a Barr body. This is a form of chromatin modification and gene silencing that reduces the effect of having an extra X chromosome. This process is related to chromatin methylation, which is a mechanism involving histone modification. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome is chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases.\n\nAnswer:C)",
