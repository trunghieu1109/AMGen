Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, resulting in an XXY karyotype. In Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the X chromosomes undergoes X-inactivation, which mitigates the phenotypic consequences. This is different from Down's syndrome, which is caused by an extra chromosome 21 and does not have a similar inactivation mechanism. The question asks for the molecular mechanism responsible for the less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome. The choices given involve different stages and processes in meiosis or embryogenesis. The most relevant mechanism related to the reduced phenotypic impact of having an extra X chromosome (as in Klinefelter's) is chromatin methylation, which is related to X-inactivation. Therefore, the correct choice involves chromatin methylation.
