Question: {'question': "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", 'choice1': 'progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', 'choice2': 'attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', 'choice3': 'chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', 'choice4': 'chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent NExH', content='Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY) phenotypic consequences are milder than Down syndrome (trisomy 21) because one of the X chromosomes is largely inactivated via X-chromosome inactivation, an epigenetic process involving histone methylation and DNA methylation. This corresponds to choice 3, chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
