            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "The vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 is a radial field, meaning it only has a component in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, such a field can be expressed as f(r) = (1/r^2) e_r, where e_r is the unit radial vector. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field A(r) e_r is given by \u2207.A = (1/r^2) d/dr (r^2 A(r)). Here, A(r) = 1/r^2, so we compute the divergence: \u2207.f = (1/r^2) d/dr (r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) d/dr (1) = 0. Thus, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is not defined. The volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R is \u222b(\u2207.f) dV = \u222b0 dV = 0, since the divergence is zero everywhere in the volume of the sphere. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
