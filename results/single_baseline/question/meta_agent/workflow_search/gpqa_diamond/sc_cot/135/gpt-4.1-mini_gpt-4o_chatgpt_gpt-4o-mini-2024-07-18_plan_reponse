            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "We have a vector field f(r) = (1/r^2) * r\u0302, where r\u0302 is the radial unit vector. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field f(r) = f(r) r\u0302 is given by \u2207.f = (1/r^2) \u2202/\u2202r (r^2 f(r)). Substituting f(r) = 1/r^2, we get \u2207.f = (1/r^2) \u2202/\u2202r (r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) \u2202/\u2202r (1) = 0. Therefore, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere. The volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R is \u222b(\u2207.f) dV = \u222b0 dV = 0, since the integrand is zero.\n\nAnswer:C)",
