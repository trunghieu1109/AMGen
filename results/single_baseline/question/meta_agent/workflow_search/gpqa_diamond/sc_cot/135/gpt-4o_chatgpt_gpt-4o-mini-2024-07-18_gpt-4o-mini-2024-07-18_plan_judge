Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field ∇·f inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin, we can use the Divergence Theorem. The divergence of the vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 in the radial direction can be computed. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a radial field f(r) = f(r) e_r is given by ∇·f = (1/r^2)(∂/∂r)(r^2 f(r)). For f(r) = 1/r^2, we find that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Therefore, the integral of the divergence over the volume of the sphere, which does not include the origin, will yield 0. Thus, the answer is 0.
