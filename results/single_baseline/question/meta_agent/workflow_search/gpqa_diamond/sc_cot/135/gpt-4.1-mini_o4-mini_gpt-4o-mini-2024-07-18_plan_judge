Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The field is f→=r̂/r2. Outside the origin its divergence is zero, but the integral of ∇·f over the volume equals the flux of f through the sphere. By Gauss’s theorem, ∫V∇·f dV=∮S f·dS. Here dS=r̂R2sinθdθdϕ, and f·dS=(1/R2)R2sinθdθdϕ=sinθdθdϕ. Integrating over θ,ϕ gives 4π.
