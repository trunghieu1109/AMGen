Question: {'question': 'A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', 'choice1': '1', 'choice2': '4 π', 'choice3': '0', 'choice4': '4/3 π R '}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MHGg', content='The field is f→=r̂/r2. Outside the origin its divergence is zero, but the integral of ∇·f over the volume equals the flux of f through the sphere. By Gauss’s theorem, ∫V∇·f dV=∮S f·dS. Here dS=r̂R2sinθdθdϕ, and f·dS=(1/R2)R2sinθdθdϕ=sinθdθdϕ. Integrating over θ,ϕ gives 4π.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
