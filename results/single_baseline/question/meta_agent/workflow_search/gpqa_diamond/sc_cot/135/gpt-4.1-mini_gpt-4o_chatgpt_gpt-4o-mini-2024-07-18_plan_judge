Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We have a vector field f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂, where r̂ is the radial unit vector. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field f(r) = f(r) r̂ is given by ∇.f = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r (r^2 f(r)). Substituting f(r) = 1/r^2, we get ∇.f = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r (r^2 * 1/r^2) = (1/r^2) ∂/∂r (1) = 0. Therefore, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere. The volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R is ∫(∇.f) dV = ∫0 dV = 0, since the integrand is zero.
