            "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?",

        "response": "The field is f\u2192=r\u0302/r2. Outside the origin its divergence is zero, but the integral of \u2207\u00b7f over the volume equals the flux of f through the sphere. By Gauss\u2019s theorem, \u222bV\u2207\u00b7f dV=\u222eS f\u00b7dS. Here dS=r\u0302R2sin\u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5, and f\u00b7dS=(1/R2)R2sin\u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5=sin\u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5. Integrating over \u03b8,\u03d5 gives 4\u03c0.\n\nAnswer:B)",
