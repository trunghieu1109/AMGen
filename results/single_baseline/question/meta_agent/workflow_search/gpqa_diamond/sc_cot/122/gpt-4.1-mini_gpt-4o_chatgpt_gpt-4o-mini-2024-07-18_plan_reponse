            "A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)",

        "response": "In the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. According to special relativity, time dilation must be considered when switching between reference frames. The time dilation factor (Lorentz factor) is given by \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where v is the velocity of the center of the Galaxy as observed from the ejecta (60,000 km/s) and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). First, calculate \u03b3, then find the time that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula. Finally, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame using the velocity and the dilated time.\n\nAnswer:C)",
