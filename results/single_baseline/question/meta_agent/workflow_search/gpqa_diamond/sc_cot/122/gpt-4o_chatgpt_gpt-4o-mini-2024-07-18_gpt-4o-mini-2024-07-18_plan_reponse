            "A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)",

        "response": "To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame, we need to consider the speed of the center of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta. The center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. In the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is approaching it at this speed. Therefore, in the 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta's reference frame, we can calculate the distance traveled by the center of the Galaxy (which is equivalent to the distance the ejecta would appear to travel in the Galaxy's frame). The formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. Thus, distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60,000 km/s \u00d7 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nAnswer:B",
