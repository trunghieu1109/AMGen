            "A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the effects of time dilation due to special relativity, as the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is significant (60,000 km/s). In the reference frame of the ejecta, 50 seconds pass. Due to time dilation, the time that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame will be longer. The time dilation factor (gamma) is given by \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where v = 60,000 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s. Calculate \u03b3, then find the time in the Galaxy frame (t') using t' = \u03b3 * 50 seconds. Finally, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame by multiplying the speed of the ejecta (60,000 km/s) by the time t'.\n\nAnswer:3 060 000 km.",
