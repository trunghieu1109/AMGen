Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mllO', content="To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame, we need to consider the speed of the center of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta. The center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. In the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is approaching it at this speed. Therefore, in the 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta's reference frame, we can calculate the distance traveled by the center of the Galaxy (which is equivalent to the distance the ejecta would appear to travel in the Galaxy's frame). The formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. Thus, distance = speed × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nAnswer:B", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
