Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 14d3', content="In the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. According to special relativity, time dilation must be considered when switching between reference frames. The time dilation factor (Lorentz factor) is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where v is the velocity of the center of the Galaxy as observed from the ejecta (60,000 km/s) and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). First, calculate γ, then find the time that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula. Finally, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame using the velocity and the dilated time.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
