Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of the various cobalt(II) species formed in the solution. The cobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes can be represented as Co(SCN)n, where n can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The stability constants provided will help us determine the distribution of these complexes. We will use the stability constants to find the relative concentrations of each species and then calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes. After performing the calculations, we will compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct answer.
