            "We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ",

        "response": "We have Co2+ and SCN- at c(Co)_tot=0.01 M and c(SCN-)_tot=0.1 M. Because SCN- is in large excess, we approximate [SCN-]_free\u22480.1 M. The distribution fractions of the complexes are given by \u03b1n = \u03b2n[SCN-]^n / (1+\u03a3\u03b2i[SCN-]^i). Compute: \u03b21[SCN]=9\u00d70.1=0.9; \u03b22[SCN]^2=40\u00d70.01=0.4; \u03b23[SCN]^3=63\u00d70.001=0.063; \u03b24[SCN]^4=16\u00d70.0001=0.0016. Summing gives denominator 1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 0.4/2.3646\u22480.1692 or 16.92%.\n\nAnswer:A)",
