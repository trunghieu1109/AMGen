Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and use the given stability constants to find the concentration of each complex. The complexes can be represented as Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) are cumulative formation constants for these complexes. We are specifically interested in the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)2, which corresponds to β2. The stability constant β2 = 40 means that [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and then find its percentage among all cobalt-containing species. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10^-2 M, and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. Using β2 = 40, we calculate [Co(SCN)2] and then sum up the concentrations of all cobalt species to find the percentage of Co(SCN)2.
