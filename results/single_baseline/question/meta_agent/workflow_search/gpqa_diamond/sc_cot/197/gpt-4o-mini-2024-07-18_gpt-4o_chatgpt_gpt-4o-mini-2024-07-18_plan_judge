Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we first need to understand the equilibrium of the cobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes. The complexes formed are Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The stability constants are given as β1 = [Co(SCN)+]/([Co2+][SCN-]), β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/([Co2+][SCN-]^2), β3 = [Co(SCN)3-]/([Co2+][SCN-]^3), and β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2-]/([Co2+][SCN-]^4). We need to find the concentration of each complex and then find the fraction of Co(SCN)2. The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 0.01 M. We use the stability constants and the concentrations to set up equations for the distribution of cobalt among its complexes. Let [Co2+] = x, then [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * x * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3, and [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these concentrations: 0.01 = x + β1 * x * [SCN-] + β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 + β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 + β4 * x * [SCN-]^4. Substituting [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we solve for x and calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2. Finally, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is given by 100 * [Co(SCN)2] / 0.01.
