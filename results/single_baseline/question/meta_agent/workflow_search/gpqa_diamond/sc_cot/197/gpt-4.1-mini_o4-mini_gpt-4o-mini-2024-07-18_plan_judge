Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have Co2+ and SCN- at c(Co)_tot=0.01 M and c(SCN-)_tot=0.1 M. Because SCN- is in large excess, we approximate [SCN-]_free≈0.1 M. The distribution fractions of the complexes are given by αn = βn[SCN-]^n / (1+Σβi[SCN-]^i). Compute: β1[SCN]=9×0.1=0.9; β2[SCN]^2=40×0.01=0.4; β3[SCN]^3=63×0.001=0.063; β4[SCN]^4=16×0.0001=0.0016. Summing gives denominator 1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 0.4/2.3646≈0.1692 or 16.92%.
