Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pbLu', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of the various cobalt(II) species formed in the solution. The cobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes can be represented as Co(SCN)n, where n can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The stability constants provided will help us determine the distribution of these complexes. We will use the stability constants to find the relative concentrations of each species and then calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes. After performing the calculations, we will compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:25.6%', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
