Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zYQp', content='To solve this problem, we need to consider the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and use the given stability constants to find the concentration of each complex. The complexes can be represented as Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) are cumulative formation constants for these complexes. We are specifically interested in the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)2, which corresponds to β2. The stability constant β2 = 40 means that [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and then find its percentage among all cobalt-containing species. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10^-2 M, and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. Using β2 = 40, we calculate [Co(SCN)2] and then sum up the concentrations of all cobalt species to find the percentage of Co(SCN)2.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
