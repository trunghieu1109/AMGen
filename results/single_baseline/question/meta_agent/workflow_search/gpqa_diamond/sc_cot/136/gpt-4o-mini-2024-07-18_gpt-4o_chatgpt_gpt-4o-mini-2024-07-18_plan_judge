Question: Example(question='A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at \\$t=0\\$ with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. \\$T\\simeq0\\$ undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy \\$T{1}=950MeV\\$. The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by\nU\\left(t\\right)=U{0}\\cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu\\left(\\alpha\\right)t+\\Phi_{0}\\right].\n\nHow many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?\nData : \\$\\Phi{0}=\\frac{\\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\\$. ', choice1='1864', choice2='2500', choice3='3536', choice4='5300', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to consider the energy gained per revolution and the total energy required. The proton gains energy twice per revolution due to the alternating voltage, so the energy gain per revolution is 2 * U0. Given U0 = 190 kV, the energy gain per revolution is 380 keV. The total kinetic energy required is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. The number of revolutions is the total energy divided by the energy gain per revolution: 950,000 keV / 380 keV/revolution.
