proposed answer: To find the number of revolutions the proton makes, we need to consider the energy gained per revolution and the total energy to be gained. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and needs to reach 950 MeV. The energy gained per revolution is related to the voltage applied. Given U0 = 190 kV, the energy gained per acceleration is 190 keV. However, since the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution (one for each half of the cycle), the energy gained per revolution is 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. To reach 950 MeV, the total number of revolutions required is 950 MeV / 380 keV = 2500 revolutions.
