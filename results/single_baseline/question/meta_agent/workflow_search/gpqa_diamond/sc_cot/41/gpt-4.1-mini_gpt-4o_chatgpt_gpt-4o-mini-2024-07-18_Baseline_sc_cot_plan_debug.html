    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, mass, and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature T of a planet is related to the distance from its star (d) by T ∝ d^(-1/2), assuming the albedo is the same. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures gives us T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. From these, we can find the distance ratios: d1/d2 = (T2/T1)^2 = 1/1.4^2, and d2/d3 = (T3/T2)^2 = 1/2.3^2. The orbital period P of a planet is related to its distance by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 ∝ d^3. Therefore, P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2). We find d3/d1 = (d3/d2) * (d2/d1) = (1/2.3^2) * (1.4^2). Then, P3/P1 = ((1/2.3^2) * (1.4^2))^(3/2). Calculating these values gives us the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.
