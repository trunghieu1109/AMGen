Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit: T^2 ‚àù a^3. The equilibrium temperature (Te) can be related to the semi-major axis, albedo, and the luminosity of the star. Given the ratios of temperatures and masses, we can derive the ratios of the semi-major axes and subsequently the ratios of the orbital periods. The ratios of the equilibrium temperatures suggest a relationship between the distances of the planets from the star. We will calculate the ratios and apply them to find the desired period ratio.
