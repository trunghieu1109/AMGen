Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to relate the equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods of the planets. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the distance from its star and its albedo. Assuming the albedo is the same, the temperature ratio between two planets can be related to the ratio of their orbital distances (T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(-1/2)). Given T1/T2 = 1.4, we have (d2/d1) = (1/1.4)^2. Similarly, for T2/T3 = 2.3, (d3/d2) = (1/2.3)^2. The orbital period P is related to the distance d by Kepler's third law (P^2 ∝ d^3). Therefore, (P3/P1)^2 = (d3/d1)^3. We calculate d3/d1 = (d3/d2) * (d2/d1) = (1/2.3)^2 * (1/1.4)^2. Then, (P3/P1) = ((d3/d1)^3)^(1/2). Calculating these values, we find that (P3/P1) ≈ 10.4.
