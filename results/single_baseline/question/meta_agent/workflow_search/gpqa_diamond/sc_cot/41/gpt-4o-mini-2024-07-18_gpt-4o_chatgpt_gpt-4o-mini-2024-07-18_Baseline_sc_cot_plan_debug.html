    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to relate the equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods of the planets. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the distance from its star and its albedo. Assuming the albedo is the same, the temperature ratio between two planets can be related to the ratio of their orbital distances (T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(-1/2)). Given T1/T2 = 1.4, we have (d2/d1) = (1/1.4)^2. Similarly, for T2/T3 = 2.3, (d3/d2) = (1/2.3)^2. The orbital period P is related to the distance d by Kepler&#39;s third law (P^2 ∝ d^3). Therefore, (P3/P1)^2 = (d3/d1)^3. We calculate d3/d1 = (d3/d2) * (d2/d1) = (1/2.3)^2 * (1/1.4)^2. Then, (P3/P1) = ((d3/d1)^3)^(1/2). Calculating these values, we find that (P3/P1) ≈ 10.4.
