            "A methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene is stirred with Pd/C under a Hydrogen atmosphere. After 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product.\n\n1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, forming product 2.\n\nProduct 2 is treated with sodium methoxide, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. and a catalytic amount of  4-dimethylaminopyridine, forming product 4.\n\nwhat is a valid structure of product 4?

        "response": "R-(+)-limonene (1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene) undergoes selective hydrogenation of the exocyclic C=C (the isopropenyl) to give 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexene (1). Epoxidation with mCPBA gives the cyclohexene 1,2-epoxide (2). MeO\u2013 opens the epoxide at C2 (SN2, inversion) to give 2-methoxy-1-hydroxy product (3). Esterification of the C1-OH with propionic acid/DCC/DMAP yields the propionate (4) bearing a methyl and propionyl at C1, OMe at C2, and isopropyl at C4. The major stereochemical outcome places the new MeO at C2 as 2S (inversion from the epoxide\u2019s 2R) and retains C4 as R, giving (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nAnswer:B)",
