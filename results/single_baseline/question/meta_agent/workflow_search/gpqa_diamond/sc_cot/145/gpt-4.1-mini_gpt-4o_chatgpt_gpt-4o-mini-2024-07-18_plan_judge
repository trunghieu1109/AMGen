Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride is a Diels-Alder reaction. In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride) to form a cyclohexene derivative. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the endo rule, which favors the endo product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented towards the diene. The fluorine substituent on the diene can influence the stereochemistry of the adduct. Based on the endo preference and the stereochemical influence of the fluorine, the major product is likely to be one of the given choices with the correct stereochemistry.
