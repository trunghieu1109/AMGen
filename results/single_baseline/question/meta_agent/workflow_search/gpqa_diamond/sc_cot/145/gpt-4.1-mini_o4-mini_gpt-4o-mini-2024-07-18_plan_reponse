        "response": "The reaction of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene with maleic anhydride undergoes a normal Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition. The endo approach is favored by secondary orbital interactions, and although sterics might disfavour an approach syn to the small F\u2010substituent, fluorine is small enough that endo predominates. In the resulting bicyclic anhydride, the two anhydride carbons (C4 and C7) adopt the meso relationship (one R, one S), and the F at C8 also ends up on the same face (endo), which gives the 3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8R stereochemistry. This corresponds to choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
