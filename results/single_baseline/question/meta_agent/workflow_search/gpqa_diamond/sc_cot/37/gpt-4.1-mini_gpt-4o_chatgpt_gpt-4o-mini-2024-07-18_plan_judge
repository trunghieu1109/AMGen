Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The given reaction involves an enamine, which can undergo alkylation followed by hydrolysis. The enamine reacts with LDA to form an enolate, which can then react with an alkyl halide like CH3CH2I to form an alkylated intermediate. Finally, hydrolysis with H3O+ regenerates the carbonyl compound. The enamine in the question is derived from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine. After alkylation with CH3CH2I, the resulting compound would be heptan-4-one. Therefore, the correct sequence of reagents and the resulting product is given in choice 4.
