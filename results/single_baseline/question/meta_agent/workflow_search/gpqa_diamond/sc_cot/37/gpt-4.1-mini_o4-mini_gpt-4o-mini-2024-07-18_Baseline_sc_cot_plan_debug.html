    <pre>The enamine derived from pentan-2-one reacts with ethyl iodide under basic conditions followed by acid hydrolysis to give the α‐ethylated ketone. That ketone is heptan‐4‐one (since the ethyl group adds at the 4‐position of a 7‐carbon chain). The reagent sequence is (i) LDA in DME to form the enolate, (ii) CH3CH2I to alkylate, and (iii) H3O+ to hydrolyze, which corresponds to choice 4.
