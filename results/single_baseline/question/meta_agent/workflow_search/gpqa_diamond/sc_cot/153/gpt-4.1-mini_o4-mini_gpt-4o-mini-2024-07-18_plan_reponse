The IR shows a broad 3500\u20132700 cm\u207b\u00b9 band and a sharp 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 band, characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The \u00b9H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (CO\u2082H) and two doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits these data.\n\nAnswer:A)",
