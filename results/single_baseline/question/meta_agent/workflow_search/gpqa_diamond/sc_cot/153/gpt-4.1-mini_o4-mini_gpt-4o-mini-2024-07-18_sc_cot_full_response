Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent HhPU', content='The molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 (~32%) indicates one chlorine atom. The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band, characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (CO₂H) and two doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits these data.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
