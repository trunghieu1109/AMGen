    <pre>To identify the compound, we analyze the spectral data provided. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 indicates a possible isotopic pattern, likely due to the presence of chlorine, which has a natural abundance of about 33% for its heavier isotope. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicating the presence of an -OH group, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely from a carboxylic acid or an ester. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the other peaks suggest the presence of aromatic protons. Given these clues, we can analyze the choices provided. 4-chlorobenzoic acid has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and matches the spectral data with a carboxylic acid group and chlorine substituent. The other options do not fit the molecular weight or spectral data as well as 4-chlorobenzoic acid does.
