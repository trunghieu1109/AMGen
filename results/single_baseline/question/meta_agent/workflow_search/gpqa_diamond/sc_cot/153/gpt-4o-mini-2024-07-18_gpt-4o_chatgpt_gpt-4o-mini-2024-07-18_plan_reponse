        "response": "The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a significant peak at m/z = 158, which suggests the presence of a chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of an O-H group, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, characteristic of a carbonyl group (such as C=O in a carboxylic acid or ester). The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, which suggest an aromatic ring with substituents in a para or ortho position. Considering these data, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most reasonable structure: it has the correct molecular weight, the chlorine isotope pattern, the carboxylic acid group (explaining the IR and 1H NMR), and the aromatic protons matching the NMR data.\n\nAnswer:A)",
