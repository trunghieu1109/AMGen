    <pre>The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a 100% abundance and a peak at m/z = 158 with 32% abundance, suggesting the presence of a chlorine atom (due to the Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of an O-H stretch, possibly from a carboxylic acid, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a C=O stretch, which is common in carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, likely corresponding to an acidic proton (such as in a carboxylic acid), and doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, suggesting an aromatic ring with four equivalent protons, possibly para-substituted. 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria: it has a carboxylic acid group (accounting for the IR and the singlet at 11.0 ppm in NMR), a chlorine atom (accounting for the mass spectrometry data), and a para-substituted benzene ring (accounting for the NMR doublets).
