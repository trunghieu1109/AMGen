        "response": "3-Methylpent-1-ene self-metathesis gives 3,7-dimethyloct-4-ene plus ethene. The dimer has two chiral centers (at C3 and C7) and an internal C=C (E/Z). The substituents on both sides are identical, so R,R and S,S form an enantiomeric pair, and R,S (\u2261S,R) is a meso isomer. Each of these three diastereomeric configurations can be E or Z, giving 3\u00d72=6 stereoisomers (excluding ethene).\n\nAnswer:B)",
