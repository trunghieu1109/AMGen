Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cCZ', content='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has stereochemistry that can lead to different products when treated with Grubbs catalyst, which is used for olefin metathesis. The presence of the double bond and the chiral center means that several combinations of products can be formed. Each unique combination of the two alkene partners can yield different products. After analyzing the possible outcomes, I find that there are 6 distinct products that can be formed from this reaction.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
