Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: 3-Methylpent-1-ene self-metathesis gives 3,7-dimethyloct-4-ene plus ethene. The dimer has two chiral centers (at C3 and C7) and an internal C=C (E/Z). The substituents on both sides are identical, so R,R and S,S form an enantiomeric pair, and R,S (≡S,R) is a meso isomer. Each of these three diastereomeric configurations can be E or Z, giving 3×2=6 stereoisomers (excluding ethene).
