        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mixture of two enantiomers. When treated with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis, the double bonds can rearrange. The Grubbs catalyst will perform a cross-metathesis reaction, potentially leading to the formation of various products depending on the possible combinations of the alkenes. Since we are dealing with a racemic mixture, each enantiomer can react with itself or the other enantiomer, leading to more possible products. We must consider the symmetrical and unsymmetrical nature of the products formed. The key is to count all unique products, excluding ethene, which is a byproduct of the reaction.\n\nAnswer:4",
