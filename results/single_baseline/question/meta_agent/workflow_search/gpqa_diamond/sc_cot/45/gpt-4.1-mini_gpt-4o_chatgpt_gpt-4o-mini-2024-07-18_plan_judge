Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has two enantiomers. Each enantiomer can undergo metathesis with itself or with the other enantiomer. The Grubbs catalyst facilitates the metathesis reaction, which can result in different combinations of products. The possible products come from the different ways the alkenes can couple. The enantiomers can form dimers in two different orientations (head-to-head and head-to-tail), and each orientation can happen for both enantiomers, leading to a variety of products. Considering stereochemistry, each dimer can have different stereoisomers. This results in a total of 8 different possible products, excluding ethene.
