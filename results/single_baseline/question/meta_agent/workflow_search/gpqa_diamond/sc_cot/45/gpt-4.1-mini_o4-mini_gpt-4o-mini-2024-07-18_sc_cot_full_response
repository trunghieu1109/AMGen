Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cCZ', content='3-Methylpent-1-ene self-metathesis gives 3,7-dimethyloct-4-ene plus ethene. The dimer has two chiral centers (at C3 and C7) and an internal C=C (E/Z). The substituents on both sides are identical, so R,R and S,S form an enantiomeric pair, and R,S (≡S,R) is a meso isomer. Each of these three diastereomeric configurations can be E or Z, giving 3×2=6 stereoisomers (excluding ethene).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
