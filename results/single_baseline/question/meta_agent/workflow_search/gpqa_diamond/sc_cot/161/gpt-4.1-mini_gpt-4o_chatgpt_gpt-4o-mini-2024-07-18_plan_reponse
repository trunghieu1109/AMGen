        "response": "The given metric is ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right). To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we need to consider the region where x^{2} + y^{2} < 4, since the metric becomes singular at x^{2} + y^{2} = 4. The area element in this metric is dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} dx dy. To find the total area, we integrate this over the region x^{2} + y^{2} < 4. We switch to polar coordinates where x = r\\cos\\theta and y = r\\sin\\theta, then x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}, and the area element becomes dA = \\frac{32}{4-r^{2}} r dr d\\theta. The limits of integration are from r = 0 to r = 2 and \\theta = 0 to \\theta = 2\\pi. The integral becomes \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^{2}} dr d\\theta. Solving the inner integral with respect to r and then the outer integral with respect to \\theta, we find the area.\n\nAnswer:A)",
