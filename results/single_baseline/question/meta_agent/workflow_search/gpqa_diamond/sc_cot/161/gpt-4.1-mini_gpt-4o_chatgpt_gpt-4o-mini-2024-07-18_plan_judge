proposed answer: The given metric is ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right). To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we need to consider the region where x^{2} + y^{2} < 4, since the metric becomes singular at x^{2} + y^{2} = 4. The area element in this metric is dA = \frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} dx dy. To find the total area, we integrate this over the region x^{2} + y^{2} < 4. We switch to polar coordinates where x = r\cos\theta and y = r\sin\theta, then x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}, and the area element becomes dA = \frac{32}{4-r^{2}} r dr d\theta. The limits of integration are from r = 0 to r = 2 and \theta = 0 to \theta = 2\pi. The integral becomes \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32r}{4-r^{2}} dr d\theta. Solving the inner integral with respect to r and then the outer integral with respect to \theta, we find the area.
