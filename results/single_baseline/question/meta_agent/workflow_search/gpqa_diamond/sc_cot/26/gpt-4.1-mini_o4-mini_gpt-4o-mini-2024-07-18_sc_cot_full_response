Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Dt0q', content='The ribonucleoprotein particle is the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds the nascent chain in the cytosol and directs it to the rough ER for glycosylation. The nascent secreted protein then travels through the secretory pathway to be released to the extracellular space. Among the provided options, this corresponds to meeting in the cytosol and heading to the extracellular space.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
