Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle is the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds the nascent chain in the cytosol and directs it to the rough ER for glycosylation. The nascent secreted protein then travels through the secretory pathway to be released to the extracellular space. Among the provided options, this corresponds to meeting in the cytosol and heading to the extracellular space.
