Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle suggests involvement with RNA, possibly a ribosome or a signal recognition particle. The nascent chain is a newly formed polypeptide chain. The mention of 'let me show you in; you really need some sugar' implies glycosylation, which occurs in the ER or Golgi apparatus. 'It seems somewhat rough' suggests the rough ER, where ribosomes are present. The chain saying 'I need to be on my way' indicates it is leaving for another destination, possibly outside the cell. Therefore, the chain is likely heading from the ribosome, located on the rough ER, to the extracellular space after processing.
