            "Two stars (Star_1 and Star_2) each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of our Sun, respectively. Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n",

        "response": "First, use definitions of abundance ratios. For Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex. Thus n(Si)_1 \u221d n(Si)_\u2299\u00b710^{0.3}. For Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 \u2013 [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 \u2013 0.3 = \u20130.3 dex, so n(Si)_2 \u221d n(Si)_\u2299\u00b710^{\u20130.3}. The ratio n(Si)_1/n(Si)_2 = 10^{0.3 \u2013 (\u20130.3)} = 10^{0.6} \u2243 4. Hence ~3.9.\n\nAnswer:C)",
