        "response": "In the annihilation process, the energy of the proton and antiproton is converted into the kinetic energy and rest mass energy of the four particles A. The rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is approximately 938 MeV each. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV, so for four A particles, the total rest mass energy is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy, 1876 MeV - 1200 MeV = 676 MeV, is the total kinetic energy of the four A particles. Since the particles are identical and likely to have the same speed, each particle has 676 MeV / 4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. The total energy of each A particle is 300 MeV (rest mass) + 169 MeV (kinetic) = 469 MeV. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we solve for v. \u03b3 = 469/300 = 1.5633. Solving for v gives v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Plugging in \u03b3 = 1.5633, we find v \u2248 0.77c.\n\nAnswer:C)",
