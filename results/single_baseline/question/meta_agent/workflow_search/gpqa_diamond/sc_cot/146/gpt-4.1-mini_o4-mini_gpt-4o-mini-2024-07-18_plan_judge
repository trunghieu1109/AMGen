proposed answer: Initial total energy in lab: proton and antiproton each at rest kinetic ≈ 0, so E_initial = 2·938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Four A’s produced, each with rest energy 300 MeV: total rest = 4·300 = 1200 MeV. Remaining kinetic energy: 1876 – 1200 = 676 MeV, equally shared by 4 particles ⇒ each has kinetic = 676/4 = 169 MeV. Total energy per A: E = 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then γ = E/(mc^2) = 469/300 ≈1.5633, so β = √(1 – 1/γ^2) = √(1 – 1/2.4439) = √0.5907 ≈0.7689. Thus v ≈0.77c.
