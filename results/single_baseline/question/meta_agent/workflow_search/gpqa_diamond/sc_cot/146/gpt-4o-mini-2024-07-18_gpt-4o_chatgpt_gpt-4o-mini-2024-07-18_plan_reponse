        "response": "In the given annihilation process, a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce 2 A+ and 2 A- particles. The rest mass energy of each A particle is given as 300 MeV. Initially, the proton and antiproton system has a rest energy of 2m_pc^2, where m_p is the proton rest mass (approximately 938 MeV/c^2). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can neglect its kinetic energy and assume the total energy available for conversion into the particles is approximately 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. This energy is distributed among the 4 A particles, giving each A particle a total energy of 1876 MeV / 4 = 469 MeV. The rest mass energy of each A particle is 300 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 469 MeV - 300 MeV = 169 MeV. The total energy E of each A particle is related to its rest mass m_A and velocity v by the relation E = gamma * m_A * c^2, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Solving for v, we find that v = 0.91c.\n\nAnswer:B)",
