            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",
            "The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.",
            "The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.",

        "response": "In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E. When one exotic massless particle M is emitted instead of the two V particles, it changes the dynamics of the energy distribution. The total energy available for the outgoing particles E is affected by the massless particle M, which allows for a different distribution of energy. Since the massless particle does not take up mass energy, the total energy available for the particles E could potentially increase, and the spectrum would likely remain continuous but with a different shape due to the different number of emitted particles. Therefore, the correct choice would be that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:choice3",
