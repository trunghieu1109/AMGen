    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;}

    <pre>In the original decay 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V, the outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum because they share the available energy with the neutrinos V, which carry away varying amounts of energy. The endpoint energy Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the neutrinos carry away minimal energy. In the variant decay 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + M, where M is a single massless particle, the situation changes. The energy available to the E particles is now shared with only one massless particle M instead of two V particles. Since M is massless, it can carry away energy continuously, allowing the E particles to have a continuous energy spectrum. However, since only one particle M carries away energy instead of two, the maximum energy the E particles can have increases, as less energy is shared with other particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint energy increases.
