Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MALJ', content='In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E. When one exotic massless particle M is emitted instead of the two V particles, it changes the dynamics of the energy distribution. The total energy available for the outgoing particles E is affected by the massless particle M, which allows for a different distribution of energy. Since the massless particle does not take up mass energy, the total energy available for the particles E could potentially increase, and the spectrum would likely remain continuous but with a different shape due to the different number of emitted particles. Therefore, the correct choice would be that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:choice3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
