Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iE6k', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum because they share the available energy with the neutrinos V, which carry away varying amounts of energy. The endpoint energy Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the neutrinos carry away minimal energy. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, where M is a single massless particle, the situation changes. The energy available to the E particles is now shared with only one massless particle M instead of two V particles. Since M is massless, it can carry away energy continuously, allowing the E particles to have a continuous energy spectrum. However, since only one particle M carries away energy instead of two, the maximum energy the E particles can have increases, as less energy is shared with other particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint energy increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
