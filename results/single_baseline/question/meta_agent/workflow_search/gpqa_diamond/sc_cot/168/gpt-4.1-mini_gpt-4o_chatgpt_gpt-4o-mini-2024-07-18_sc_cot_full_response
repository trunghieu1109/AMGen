Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', 'choice1': 'The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', 'choice2': 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', 'choice3': 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', 'choice4': 'The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iE6k', content='In the original decay, the total energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous because the neutrinos (V) carry away varying amounts of energy, allowing the energy of the E particles to vary continuously up to the endpoint Q. In the variant decay, where a single massless particle M is emitted instead of the 2V, the energy spectrum of the E particles will still be continuous because the massless particle M can carry away varying amounts of energy, similar to the neutrinos. However, since M is massless and can carry away energy, the shape of the spectrum will be adjusted. The endpoint energy available to the E particles will increase because there is one less particle (the second V) to share the energy with. Therefore, the energy spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
