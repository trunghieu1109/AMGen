Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have a “double‐beta”–type decay 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V yielding a continuous sum–electron spectrum up to the Q value. Replacing the two light neutrinos V with a single massless exotic M leaves a three–body final state (2E + M), which still gives a continuous sum–electron spectrum (not discrete) but with a different phase‐space factor. The maximum total electron energy remains at the Q value (in fact is even slightly higher if the original neutrinos had small masses), so the endpoint is effectively increased relative to the two–neutrino case. Of the provided options, only C matches a continuous spectrum with altered shape and a higher endpoint.
