            "You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?",
            "The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.",
            "The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.",

        "response": "We have a \u201cdouble\u2010beta\u201d\u2013type decay 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V yielding a continuous sum\u2013electron spectrum up to the Q value. Replacing the two light neutrinos V with a single massless exotic M leaves a three\u2013body final state (2E + M), which still gives a continuous sum\u2013electron spectrum (not discrete) but with a different phase\u2010space factor. The maximum total electron energy remains at the Q value (in fact is even slightly higher if the original neutrinos had small masses), so the endpoint is effectively increased relative to the two\u2013neutrino case. Of the provided options, only C matches a continuous spectrum with altered shape and a higher endpoint.\n\nAnswer:C",
