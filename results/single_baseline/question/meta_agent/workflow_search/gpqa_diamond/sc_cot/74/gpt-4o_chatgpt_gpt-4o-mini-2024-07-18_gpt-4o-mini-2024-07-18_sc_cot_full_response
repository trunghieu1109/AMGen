Question: {'question': "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", 'choice1': 'The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', 'choice2': 'The ribosome terminated the translation early', 'choice3': 'The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', 'choice4': 'The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DgZE', content="To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed as expected, we need to analyze the provided sequence and the potential issues that could arise during translation. The options provided suggest different possibilities, such as issues with the linker sequence, premature termination of translation, mutations in the antigenic determinant, or absence of a specific tRNA. The most critical point to consider is that if the sequence contains a stop codon (like UAA) that is not recognized by the mouse's tRNA, translation would terminate early, preventing the overexpression of the intended protein. Given that the sequence provided does not indicate any linker sequence and considering the potential for a stop codon, the most plausible explanation for the lack of overexpression is that the ribosome terminated the translation early due to encountering a UAA codon without the corresponding tRNA available in the mouse.\n\nAnswer:B", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
