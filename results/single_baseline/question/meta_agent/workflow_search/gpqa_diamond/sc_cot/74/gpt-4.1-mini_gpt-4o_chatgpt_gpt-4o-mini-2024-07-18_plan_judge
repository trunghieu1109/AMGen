Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by LipofectamineÂ®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed as expected, we need to analyze the sequence provided. The sequence is given as the plus strand of the construct. The first step is to identify the start codon, which is ATG. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon for methionine, indicating the beginning of the protein-coding sequence. Next, we should look for any stop codons that might cause premature termination of translation. The stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. Scanning through the sequence, we find that at position 21, there is a TAA codon. This is a stop codon, which means the ribosome will terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein. This early termination is likely the reason for the failure to overexpress the protein.
