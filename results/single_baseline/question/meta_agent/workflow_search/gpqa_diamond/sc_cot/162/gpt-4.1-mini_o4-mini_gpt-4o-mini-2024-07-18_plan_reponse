        "response": "First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: MW\u224855.85+3\u00d717=106.85 g/mol, so 0.1 g\u21920.1/106.85\u22489.36\u00d710\u22124 mol. Dissolution requires 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3, so H+ needed\u22483\u00d79.36\u00d710\u22124=2.81\u00d710\u22123 mol. A 0.1 M acid provides 0.1 mol/L, so volume V=2.81\u00d710\u22123/0.1\u22482.81\u00d710\u22122 L=28.1 mL. Near this minimum volume, there\u2019s essentially no free strong acid left, but Fe3+ produced hydrolyzes and acidifies the solution; using the first hydrolysis constant (pKa1\u22482.2) gives pH\u22482.0. This matches choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)",
