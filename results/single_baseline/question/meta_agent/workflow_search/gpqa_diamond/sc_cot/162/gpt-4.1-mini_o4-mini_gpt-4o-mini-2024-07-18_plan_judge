Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: MW≈55.85+3×17=106.85 g/mol, so 0.1 g→0.1/106.85≈9.36×10−4 mol. Dissolution requires 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3, so H+ needed≈3×9.36×10−4=2.81×10−3 mol. A 0.1 M acid provides 0.1 mol/L, so volume V=2.81×10−3/0.1≈2.81×10−2 L=28.1 mL. Near this minimum volume, there’s essentially no free strong acid left, but Fe3+ produced hydrolyzes and acidifies the solution; using the first hydrolysis constant (pKa1≈2.2) gives pH≈2.0. This matches choice A.
