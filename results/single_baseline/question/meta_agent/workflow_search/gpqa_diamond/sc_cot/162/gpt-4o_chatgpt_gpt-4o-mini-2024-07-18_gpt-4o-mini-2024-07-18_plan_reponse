        "response": "To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 is about 0.000935 moles. To neutralize this, we need a strong acid that provides protons (H+). Since Fe(OH)3 is a trivalent base (it can accept 3 protons), we need 3 moles of H+ for every mole of Fe(OH)3. Thus, we need 0.000935 * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. A 0.1 M solution of a strong acid provides 0.1 moles of H+ per liter. To find the volume needed to provide 0.002805 moles of H+, we use the formula volume = moles / concentration. Therefore, volume = 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L or 28.05 cm3. The resulting solution is acidic, and we can calculate the pH using the formula pH = -log[H+]. The concentration of H+ after adding the acid will be 0.1 M, and the calculated pH would be around 2.04. This matches with choice 1.\n\nAnswer:pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3",
