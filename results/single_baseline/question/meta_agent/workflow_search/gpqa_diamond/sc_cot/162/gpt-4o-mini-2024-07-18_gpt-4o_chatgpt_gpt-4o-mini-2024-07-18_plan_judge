Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to consider its solubility product, Ksp. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 (s) ⇌ Fe3+ (aq) + 3OH- (aq), and Ksp = [Fe3+][OH-]^3. We need to add enough acid to decrease the pH and thus decrease the [OH-] to the point where Fe(OH)3 can dissolve. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 0.000935 mol. To dissolve this amount, we need to neutralize the OH- ions produced. If we use a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we need to calculate the volume required to neutralize the OH- and then find the pH of the resulting solution. The pH can be determined from the concentration of H+ ions remaining after neutralization.
