Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to consider its solubility product, Ksp, and the reaction with a strong acid. Fe(OH)3 dissolves in acid as Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is very low, meaning it is not very soluble in water, but it will dissolve in acid. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to 0.1/106.87 = 0.000936 mol. Since the reaction consumes 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol of H+. A 0.1 M solution of a strong acid provides 0.1 mol of H+ per liter, so we need 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3 of the strong acid. After dissolving, the solution will contain Fe3+ ions, which can hydrolyze and affect the pH. However, given the strong acid, the pH will be determined by the excess H+ ions. The total volume will be 100 cm3, and the moles of H+ initially added are 0.002808 mol in 0.02808 L, so the concentration of H+ is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M. The pH is -log(0.02808) ≈ 2.55. Comparing this with the given choices, the closest match is choice 2: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3.
