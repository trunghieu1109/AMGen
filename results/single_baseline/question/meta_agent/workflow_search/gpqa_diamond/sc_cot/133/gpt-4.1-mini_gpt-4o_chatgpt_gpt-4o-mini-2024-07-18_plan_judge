Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we first need to determine the limiting reactant and the total amount of heat released by the reaction. The reaction involves neutralizing HCl and H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2. The balanced equations are: HCl + OH- -> H2O and H2SO4 + 2OH- -> 2H2O. First, calculate the moles of each reactant: HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol, H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol, Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH- because it dissociates completely into 2 OH- ions per formula unit. HCl will require 0.1 mol OH- and H2SO4 will require 0.18 mol OH- (0.09 mol H2SO4 * 2 OH- per mol H2SO4), totaling 0.28 mol OH- needed. Since we only have 0.2 mol OH- available, OH- is the limiting reactant. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and base is typically around -57.1 kJ/mol of water formed. Here, 0.2 mol of water is formed, so the heat released is 0.2 mol * -57.1 kJ/mol = -11.42 kJ. Converting to kcal, -11.42 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) = -2.73 kcal. This value is closest to -2.72 kcal.
