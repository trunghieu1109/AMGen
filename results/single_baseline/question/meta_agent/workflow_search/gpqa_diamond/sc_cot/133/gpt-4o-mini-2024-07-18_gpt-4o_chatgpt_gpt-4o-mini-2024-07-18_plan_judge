Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we need to determine the number of moles of H+ from the acids and OH- from the base that react. First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl gives 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H+. Next, calculate the moles of H+ from H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4 gives 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = 0.18 mol H+. Total moles of H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. Now, calculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-. The limiting reactant is OH- since there are fewer moles of OH- than H+. Therefore, 0.2 mol of H+ will react with 0.2 mol of OH-. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid-strong base reactions is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol. So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * -57.1 kJ/mol = -11.42 kJ. Converting kJ to kcal (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ), -11.42 kJ = -11.42 / 4.184 kcal = -2.73 kcal. The closest answer choice is -2.72 kcal.
