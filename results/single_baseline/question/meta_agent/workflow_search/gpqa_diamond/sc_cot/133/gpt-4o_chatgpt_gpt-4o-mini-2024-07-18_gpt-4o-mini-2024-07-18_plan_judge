Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we first need to determine the moles of each reactant in the reaction. HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 will produce BaCl2 and water, while H2SO4 will also react with Ba(OH)2. We need to calculate the total moles of HCl and H2SO4 and compare it to the moles of Ba(OH)2 to find the limiting reactant. After finding the limiting reactant, we can calculate the enthalpy change based on the complete neutralization reaction and the enthalpy of neutralization values. The final answer should be in kcal or kJ as given in the choices.

Answer:The enthalpy of neutralization for the mixed acids and base is -16.0 kJ.
Extracted answer: The enthalpy of neutralization for the mixed acids and base is -16.0 kJ.
Correct answer: 1
