            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the resistance levels of the mutants compared to the wild-type and deduce the roles and interactions of genes G1, G2, and G3. The key points are: \n1. g1 has 75% resistance, indicating G1 contributes to resistance but is not solely responsible. \n2. g2 has 0% resistance, suggesting G2 is crucial, possibly a transcription factor. \n3. g3 has 50% resistance, meaning G3 also contributes to resistance. \n4. g1g3 has 10% resistance, showing significant loss when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, indicating some redundancy or interaction between G1 and G3. \n5. g2g3 and g1g2 both have 0% resistance, reinforcing the critical role of G2. \nFrom these observations, G2 is likely a transcription factor since its knockout results in complete susceptibility (0% resistance). The interaction between G1 and G3 suggests redundancy or epistasis, with G1 potentially being epistatic towards G3 as g1g3 has lower resistance than g3 alone. Therefore, the most fitting conclusion is choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
