            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "We have an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. In the far field, its radiation pattern is that of an electric dipole aligned with the symmetry (z) axis: power per unit solid angle \u221d sin^2\u03b8. The maximum occurs at \u03b8=90\u00b0. At \u03b8=30\u00b0, sin^2(30\u00b0)=1/4, so fraction =1/4. The wavelength dependence of dipole radiation is \u221d\u03c9^4\u221d\u03bb^(\u22124). Thus the correct choice is 1/4, \u03bb^(\u22124), which corresponds to choice C.\n\nAnswer:C",
