Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the fraction of the maximum power A that will be radiated at an angle \theta = 30^0, we need to analyze the given choices and their corresponding functions of \lambda. We want to find the correct combination of fraction and form of f that matches the behavior of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution. The typical dependence on angle and wavelength for such radiation can vary, and we need to select the most appropriate one based on common principles of electromagnetic radiation.
