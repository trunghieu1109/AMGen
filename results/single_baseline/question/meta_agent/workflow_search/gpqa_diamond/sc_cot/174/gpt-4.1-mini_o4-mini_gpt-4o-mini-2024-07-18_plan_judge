Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. In the far field, its radiation pattern is that of an electric dipole aligned with the symmetry (z) axis: power per unit solid angle ∝ sin^2θ. The maximum occurs at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4, so fraction =1/4. The wavelength dependence of dipole radiation is ∝ω^4∝λ^(−4). Thus the correct choice is 1/4, λ^(−4), which corresponds to choice C.
