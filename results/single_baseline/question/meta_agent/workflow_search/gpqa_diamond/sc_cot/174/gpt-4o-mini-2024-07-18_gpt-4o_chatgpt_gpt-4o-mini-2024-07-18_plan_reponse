            "Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,",

        "response": "The problem involves a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution radiating power. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function of the wavelength \\lambda and the angle \\theta. For a spheroidal charge distribution, which is a type of dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle is generally proportional to sin^2(\\theta). The maximum power is radiated at \\theta = 90^0, and the power at any angle \\theta is proportional to sin^2(\\theta). At \\theta = 30^0, sin^2(30^0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at \\theta = 30^0 is 1/4. The power radiated by a dipole is also proportional to \\lambda^(-4), which is typical for dipole radiation. Thus, the answer is 1/4 for the fraction and \\lambda^(-4) for the form of f.\n\nAnswer:C)",
