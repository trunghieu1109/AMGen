        "response": "For four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well, each level n holds 2 particles. Ground state: fill n=1 and n=2 \u2192 E_GS = 2\u00b71E + 2\u00b74E = 10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3 \u2192 E = 2\u00b71E + 1\u00b74E + 1\u00b79E = 15E. Second excited: promote one from n=1 to n=3 \u2192 E = 1\u00b71E + 2\u00b74E + 1\u00b79E = 18E. That matches choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
