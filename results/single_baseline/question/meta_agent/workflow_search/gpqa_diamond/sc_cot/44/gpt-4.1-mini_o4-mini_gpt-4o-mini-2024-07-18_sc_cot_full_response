Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2VLf', content='For four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well, each level n holds 2 particles. Ground state: fill n=1 and n=2 → E_GS = 2·1E + 2·4E = 10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3 → E = 2·1E + 1·4E + 1·9E = 15E. Second excited: promote one from n=1 to n=3 → E = 1·1E + 2·4E + 1·9E = 18E. That matches choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
