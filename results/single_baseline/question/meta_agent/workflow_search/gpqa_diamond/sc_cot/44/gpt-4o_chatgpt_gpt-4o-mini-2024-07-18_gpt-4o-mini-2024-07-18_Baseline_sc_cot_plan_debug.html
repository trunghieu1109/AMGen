    <pre>To find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the possible configurations of these particles. Each particle can occupy a state labeled by a quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, ... The energy of a single particle in the well is given by E_n = n^2 * E. For four spin-1/2 particles, the total energy will depend on how we fill the available states while respecting the Pauli exclusion principle. The ground state will have the lowest energy configuration, while the excited states will have progressively higher energy configurations. We need to calculate the energies for the configurations that yield the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state, then compare them to the provided choices.
