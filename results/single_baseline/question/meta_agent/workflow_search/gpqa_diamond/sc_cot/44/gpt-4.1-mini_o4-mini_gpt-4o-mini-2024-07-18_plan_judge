Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: For four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite well, each level n holds 2 particles. Ground state: fill n=1 and n=2 → E_GS = 2·1E + 2·4E = 10E. First excited: promote one from n=2 to n=3 → E = 2·1E + 1·4E + 1·9E = 15E. Second excited: promote one from n=1 to n=3 → E = 1·1E + 2·4E + 1·9E = 18E. That matches choice 2.
