Question: Example(question='A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ', choice1='The increased pressure of the solution', choice2='The increased volume of the solution ', choice3='The increased temperature of the solution', choice4='The increased pH of the solution', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction is acid-catalyzed (proceeds at pH 1) so H+ accelerates it. After addition, pH rose to 4, reducing [H+], slowing the rate. The exotherm (temperature rise) would speed it up, not slow it. Pressure and volume changes arenâ€™t relevant here. Therefore the rate decrease is due to the increased pH.
