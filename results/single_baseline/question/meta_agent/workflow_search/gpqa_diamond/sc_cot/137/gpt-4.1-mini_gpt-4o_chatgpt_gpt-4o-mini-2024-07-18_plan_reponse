            "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ",
            "The increased pressure of the solution",

        "response": "The reaction was initially proceeding at pH 1, indicating a high concentration of H+ ions. After the unknown substance was added, the pH changed to 4, which means the concentration of H+ ions decreased significantly. The rate of reaction can be affected by the concentration of reactants, and since the reaction involves H+ ions, a decrease in their concentration could slow down the reaction. The exothermic nature of the reaction suggests that heat was released, but the key factor affecting the rate is the change in pH, which indicates a change in the concentration of H+ ions.\n\nAnswer:D)",
