    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;}

    <pre>Epoxidation by mCPBA is syn. For the trans (E) alkene, this gives a racemic trans-epoxide, which upon acid‐catalyzed anti‐opening yields the meso diol (one achiral compound). For the cis (Z) alkene, syn epoxidation gives a meso epoxide, whose anti‐opening yields a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. Thus the product mixture contains one meso diol plus two enantiomers (three stereoisomers). On achiral HPLC the enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso + enantiomeric pair). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three peaks (meso + each enantiomer).
