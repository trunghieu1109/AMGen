Question: {'question': 'A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent yNqX', content='In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA to form an epoxide, which upon treatment with acid will lead to a diol product. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene will also form a different epoxide, which upon acid treatment will also lead to a diol product. The (E) and (Z) isomers will lead to different stereochemical diols. Since both reactions produce different stereoisomers, we expect different products. When analyzed by standard HPLC, which does not resolve stereochemistry, we will see fewer peaks compared to chiral HPLC which does resolve stereoisomers. Thus, in standard HPLC, we will see 2 peaks (one for each diol product from (E) and (Z)), while in chiral HPLC, we will see 4 peaks (two for each diol, as they are diastereomers). Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
