Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mN8B', content='Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, forming an epoxide. The epoxide is then opened with aqueous acid, resulting in a trans-diol. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated similarly, resulting in a cis-diol. The trans-diol is a meso compound and is achiral, while the cis-diol is chiral and consists of enantiomers. In the standard reverse-phase HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound and the racemic mixture each appear as a single peak, resulting in two peaks. In the chiral HPLC, the enantiomers of the cis-diol are separated, resulting in three peaks (one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers).\n\nAnswer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
