Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent XNLb', content='Epoxidation by mCPBA is syn. For the trans (E) alkene, this gives a racemic trans-epoxide, which upon acid‐catalyzed anti‐opening yields the meso diol (one achiral compound). For the cis (Z) alkene, syn epoxidation gives a meso epoxide, whose anti‐opening yields a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. Thus the product mixture contains one meso diol plus two enantiomers (three stereoisomers). On achiral HPLC the enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso + enantiomeric pair). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three peaks (meso + each enantiomer).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
