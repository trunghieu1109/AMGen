Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, forming an epoxide. The epoxide is then opened with aqueous acid, resulting in a trans-diol. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated similarly, resulting in a cis-diol. The trans-diol is a meso compound and is achiral, while the cis-diol is chiral and consists of enantiomers. In the standard reverse-phase HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso compound and the racemic mixture each appear as a single peak, resulting in two peaks. In the chiral HPLC, the enantiomers of the cis-diol are separated, resulting in three peaks (one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers).

Answer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
