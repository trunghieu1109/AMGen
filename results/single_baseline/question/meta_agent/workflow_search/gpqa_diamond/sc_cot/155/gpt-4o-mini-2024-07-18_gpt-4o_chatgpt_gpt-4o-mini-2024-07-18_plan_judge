Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene undergoing epoxidation with mCPBA to form an epoxide, followed by acid hydrolysis to form a diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoing the same steps. The epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA gives an epoxide, and the stereochemistry of the alkene determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will form a trans-epoxide, and the (Z)-alkene will form a cis-epoxide. Upon acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the trans-epoxide will form a trans-diol, and the cis-epoxide will form a cis-diol. The two diols formed from the (E) and (Z) isomers are diastereomers. Therefore, in the standard (achiral) HPLC, which separates based on polarity and other non-chiral properties, we expect to see 2 peaks corresponding to the two different diastereomers. In the chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, each diastereomer will be separated into its two enantiomers. Thus, we expect to see 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC, corresponding to the two enantiomers of each diastereomer.

Answer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
