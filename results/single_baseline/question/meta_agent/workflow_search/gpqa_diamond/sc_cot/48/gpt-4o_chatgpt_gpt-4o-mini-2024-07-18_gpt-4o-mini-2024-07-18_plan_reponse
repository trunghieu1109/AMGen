            "Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.\n1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A\n(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C",

We will consider the structure of the reactants and the nature of the reactions (sigmatropic rearrangements) to determine the correct products for A, B, and C. After careful consideration, we will compare the derived products with the choices provided.\n\nAnswer:A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol",
