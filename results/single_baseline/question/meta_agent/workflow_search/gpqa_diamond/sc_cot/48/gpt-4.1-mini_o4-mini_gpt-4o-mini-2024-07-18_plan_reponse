            "Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.\n1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A\n(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C",

        "response": "First reaction: acid-catalyzed condensation of an amino acetal with an allylic alcohol will cyclize to a 2-aminopyran (a 6-membered dihydropyran), not to a simple ether. That matches A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine (choices 3 & 4).\n\nSecond reaction: heating a 1,5-diyne causes an intramolecular [2+2] between the two alkynes to give a cyclobutane bearing two exocyclic alkene (\u201cethylidene\u201d) substituents, i.e. 1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane (with (1Z,2E) stereochemistry). Choices 3 & 4 match this.\n\nThird reaction: a vinyl ether of an allylic alcohol undergoes a Claisen ([3,3] sigmatropic) rearrangement to give a \u03b3,\u03b4-unsaturated carbonyl (an aldehyde), not an alcohol. So C = 4-methylenehexanal. That fits choices 1 & 3.\n\nOnly choice 3 has A = aminopyran, B = diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal.\n\nAnswer:C)",
