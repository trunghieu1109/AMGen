Question: Example(question="Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Ã…. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.", choice1='~2.9', choice2='~4.5', choice3='~7.8', choice4='~1.1', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to apply the Boltzmann distribution to find the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) at two different effective temperatures. The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by: \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}} \), where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two levels, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) can be found using the wavelength \( \lambda \) given by \( E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). When the star does not have spots, the temperature is 6000 K, and when it has spots, the temperature is 5500 K. We need to calculate the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at these two temperatures. The factor by which the ratio changes is: \( \frac{\frac{n_2}{n_1}(6000 \text{ K})}{\frac{n_2}{n_1}(5500 \text{ K})} = \frac{e^{-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 6000}}}{e^{-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 5500}}} = e^{\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} (\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000})} \). Substituting \( E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \), and using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \), and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K} \), we can calculate this factor.
