    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star&#39;s surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.9&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~4.5&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~7.8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~1.1&#39;}

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the change in the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels due to the change in effective temperature caused by star spots. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The energy difference ΔE can be calculated from the given wavelength using ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck&#39;s constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. The temperatures we are dealing with are 6000 K (no spots) and 5500 K (with spots). We need to calculate the ratio of N2/N1 at these two temperatures and then find the factor by which this ratio changes. The change in the ratio is given by (N2/N1 at 6000 K) / (N2/N1 at 5500 K).
