Question: Example(question='"1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.\nFor the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?\n3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A\n3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B\n1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C', choice1='A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one', choice2='A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one', choice3='A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one', choice4='A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We need to predict the products of Pinacol rearrangement for three vicinal diols. In each case the more stabilized carbocation forms, followed by the 1,2-shift of the most migratory group (aryl > alkyl), then loss of proton to give the ketone.

A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. Protonation and loss of water at the less stabilized OH (at C4) gives a benzylic cation at C4; methyl from C3 then migrates to C4, and loss of proton from the remaining OH at C3 produces the ketone. This leads to 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol. Protonation at C3 (benzylic) and loss of water yields a cation at C3; the more electron-rich p-hydroxyphenyl migrates from C3 to C2, then deprotonation at C2 gives 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol. Protonation and water loss form the most stabilized cation and the 4-methoxyphenyl migrates to give a ketone at C1. The product is 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.

These correspond to choice 3.
