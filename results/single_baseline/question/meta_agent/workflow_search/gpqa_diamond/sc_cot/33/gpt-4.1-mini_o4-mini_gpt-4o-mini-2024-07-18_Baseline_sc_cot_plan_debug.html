    <pre>We need to predict the products of Pinacol rearrangement for three vicinal diols. In each case the more stabilized carbocation forms, followed by the 1,2-shift of the most migratory group (aryl &gt; alkyl), then loss of proton to give the ketone.

A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. Protonation and loss of water at the less stabilized OH (at C4) gives a benzylic cation at C4; methyl from C3 then migrates to C4, and loss of proton from the remaining OH at C3 produces the ketone. This leads to 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol. Protonation at C3 (benzylic) and loss of water yields a cation at C3; the more electron-rich p-hydroxyphenyl migrates from C3 to C2, then deprotonation at C2 gives 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol. Protonation and water loss form the most stabilized cation and the 4-methoxyphenyl migrates to give a ketone at C1. The product is 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one.

These correspond to choice 3.
