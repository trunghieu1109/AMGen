Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have Ca-EDTA formation constant Kf=5×10^10, so the dissociation constant Kd=1/Kf=2×10^-11. For an initial 0.02 M complex, let x = [Ca2+] dissociated. At equilibrium x^2/(0.02–x)=Kd≈2×10^-11. Approximating 0.02–x≈0.02 gives x^2≈4×10^-13, so x≈√(4×10^-13)=6.3×10^-7 M.
