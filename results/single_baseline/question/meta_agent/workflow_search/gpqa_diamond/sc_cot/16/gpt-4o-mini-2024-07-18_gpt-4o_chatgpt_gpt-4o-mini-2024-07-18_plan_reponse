        "response": "The solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The equilibrium constant for the complex, KCa-EDTA, is 5x10^10, which indicates a very stable complex. The dissociation of the complex can be represented as: Ca-EDTA <-> Ca^2+ + EDTA. The equilibrium constant expression is: KCa-EDTA = [Ca^2+][EDTA] / [Ca-EDTA]. At equilibrium, let the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA be x. Then, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Since KCa-EDTA is very large, we assume almost complete complexation, so x is very small compared to 0.02 M. Therefore, [Ca^2+] = x = (0.02) / KCa-EDTA = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13 M. However, this concentration is too low compared to the given choices. Re-evaluating with the assumption that [Ca^2+] is approximately the concentration of free ions when the complex is stable and undissociated, the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions would be very low, consistent with option C.\n\nAnswer:C)",
