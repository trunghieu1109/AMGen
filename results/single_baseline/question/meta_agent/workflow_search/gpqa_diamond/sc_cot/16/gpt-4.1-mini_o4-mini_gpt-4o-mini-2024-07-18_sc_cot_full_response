Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent g2Xu', content='We have Ca-EDTA formation constant Kf=5×10^10, so the dissociation constant Kd=1/Kf=2×10^-11. For an initial 0.02 M complex, let x = [Ca2+] dissociated. At equilibrium x^2/(0.02–x)=Kd≈2×10^-11. Approximating 0.02–x≈0.02 gives x^2≈4×10^-13, so x≈√(4×10^-13)=6.3×10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
