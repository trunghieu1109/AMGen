        "response": "To find the concentration of calcium ions in the solution containing the Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA. The reaction can be represented as: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc Ca-EDTA. The equilibrium expression is KCa-EDTA = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]. Given that the concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M and KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10, we can rearrange the equation to find [Ca^2+]. Assuming that the concentration of EDTA remains approximately constant because it is in excess, we can simplify the calculations. The concentration of calcium ions can be derived from the equilibrium expression, leading us to find the concentration of calcium ions as 1.0x10^-2 M, which corresponds to choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A",
