    <pre>To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. The equilibrium constant K_Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. If the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, at equilibrium, the concentration of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ will be x M each, and the concentration of Ca-EDTA will be (0.02 - x) M. The equilibrium expression is K_Ca-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA] = x²/(0.02-x). Since K_Ca-EDTA is very large, the complex dissociates significantly, and x is approximately 0.02 M, making the denominator very small, leading to a large x value. However, solving the equation x²/(0.02-x) = 5x10^10 shows that x is actually very small compared to 0.02 M, due to the large K value. Approximating x² ≈ 0.02 * 5x10^10, we solve for x to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions.
