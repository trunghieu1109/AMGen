        "response": "We have Ca-EDTA formation constant Kf=5\u00d710^10, so the dissociation constant Kd=1/Kf=2\u00d710^-11. For an initial 0.02 M complex, let x = [Ca2+] dissociated. At equilibrium x^2/(0.02\u2013x)=Kd\u22482\u00d710^-11. Approximating 0.02\u2013x\u22480.02 gives x^2\u22484\u00d710^-13, so x\u2248\u221a(4\u00d710^-13)=6.3\u00d710^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:C)",
