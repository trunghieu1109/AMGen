Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the concentration of calcium ions in the solution containing the Ca-EDTA complex, we can use the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA. The reaction can be represented as: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA. The equilibrium expression is KCa-EDTA = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]. Given that the concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M and KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10, we can rearrange the equation to find [Ca^2+]. Assuming that the concentration of EDTA remains approximately constant because it is in excess, we can simplify the calculations. The concentration of calcium ions can be derived from the equilibrium expression, leading us to find the concentration of calcium ions as 1.0x10^-2 M, which corresponds to choice 1.
