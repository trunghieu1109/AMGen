Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Solar neutrinos in 700–800 keV (band 1) come almost solely from the pp-III (⁸B) continuum; 7Be line at 862 keV lies in 800–900 keV (band 2). Stopping pp-III kills all ⁸B neutrinos after 8.5 min, so band 1→0, band 2 retains the 7Be line. The ratio→0, i.e. ≪10⁻². The closest nonzero choice is 10⁻².
