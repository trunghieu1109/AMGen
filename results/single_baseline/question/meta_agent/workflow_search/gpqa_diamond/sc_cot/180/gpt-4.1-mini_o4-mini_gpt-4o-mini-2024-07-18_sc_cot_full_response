Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UTaM', content='Solar neutrinos in 700–800 keV (band 1) come almost solely from the pp-III (⁸B) continuum; 7Be line at 862 keV lies in 800–900 keV (band 2). Stopping pp-III kills all ⁸B neutrinos after 8.5 min, so band 1→0, band 2 retains the 7Be line. The ratio→0, i.e. ≪10⁻². The closest nonzero choice is 10⁻².\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
