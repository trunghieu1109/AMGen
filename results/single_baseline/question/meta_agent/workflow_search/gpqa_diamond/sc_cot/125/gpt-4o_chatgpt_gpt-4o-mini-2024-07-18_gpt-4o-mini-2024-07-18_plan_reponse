            "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?",

        "response": "To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, we need to analyze the products of both reactions. Reaction I involves the reduction of a chiral ketone, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which will yield an alcohol and potentially some diastereomers, depending on the reaction specifics. Reaction II involves the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione, which is an achiral molecule, and will yield one or two alcohol products depending on the extent of reduction. In the normal-phase HPLC, achiral compounds will typically show as one peak, while chiral compounds can show multiple peaks depending on their stereochemistry. Given that Reaction I produces chiral products and Reaction II produces achiral products, we can conclude that the chiral HPLC will show peaks corresponding to the chiral products from Reaction I, while the normal-phase HPLC will show peaks based on the total number of unique compounds produced. Considering the choices and the nature of the reactions, the most plausible outcome is that we will see 3 peaks in chiral HPLC (due to the presence of different stereoisomers) and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC (one for each unique compound from the reactions).\n\nAnswer:A",
