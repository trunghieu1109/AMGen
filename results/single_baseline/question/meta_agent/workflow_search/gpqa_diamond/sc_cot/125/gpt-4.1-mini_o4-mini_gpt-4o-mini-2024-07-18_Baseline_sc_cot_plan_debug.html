    <pre>Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has one stereocenter at C5. LAH reduces the C3 ketone to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter. With the existing S at C5, reduction gives two diastereomers ((3R,5S) and (3S,5S)), separable on normal-phase HPLC (2 peaks) and appearing as two peaks on chiral HPLC (still single enantiomers).

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione reduced by NaBH4 gives a 2,4-diol with two stereocenters (C2 and C4). There are three stereoisomers: the achiral meso form and the enantiomeric pair (R,R) and (S,S). On normal-phase HPLC, the enantiomers coelute (1 peak) and meso is separate (2 peaks total). On chiral HPLC, the enantiomers separate (2 peaks) plus meso (1 peak), giving 3 peaks.

Combined: Normal-phase sees 2 (Reaction I) + 2 (Reaction II) = 4 peaks. Chiral-phase sees 2 (Reaction I) + 3 (Reaction II) = 5 peaks.
