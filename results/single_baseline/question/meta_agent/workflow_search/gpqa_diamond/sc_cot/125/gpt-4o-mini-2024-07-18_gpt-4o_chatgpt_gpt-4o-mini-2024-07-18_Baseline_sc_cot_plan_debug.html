    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze each reaction step by step. Reaction I involves the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, which reduces the ketone to an alcohol. Since the starting material is chiral and LAH reduction of ketones generally proceeds with retention of configuration, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single chiral alcohol. Reaction II involves the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, resulting in 2,4-pentanediol. However, 2,4-pentanediol has two stereocenters, so it can form multiple stereoisomers. Specifically, it can form four stereoisomers: (2R,4R), (2S,4S), (2R,4S), and (2S,4R). Therefore, after combining the products from both reactions, we have one chiral product from Reaction I and four stereoisomers from Reaction II. In a normal-phase HPLC, the chiral nature of the molecules doesn&#39;t affect the separation, so we would see two peaks: one for the single chiral alcohol from Reaction I and one for the mixture of stereoisomers from Reaction II. However, in a chiral HPLC, each stereoisomer can be separated, so we would see five peaks: one for the single chiral alcohol from Reaction I and four for the stereoisomers from Reaction II.

Answer:5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC</pre>
