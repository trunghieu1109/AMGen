    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze each reaction step by step. 

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group to an alcohol group. The product will be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since the starting material is chiral and the reduction does not affect the stereocenter, the product remains as a single enantiomer.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 reduces both carbonyl groups to alcohol groups. The product will be 2,4-pentanediol. Since the starting material is achiral and the reduction creates two new stereocenters, we get a racemic mixture of 2,4-pentanediol, which consists of (2R,4R), (2S,4S), (2R,4S), and (2S,4R) stereoisomers.

Now let&#39;s combine the products from both reactions. We have:
1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol from Reaction I (1 peak in normal-phase HPLC, 1 peak in chiral HPLC)
2. Racemic 2,4-pentanediol from Reaction II, which gives 1 peak in normal-phase HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC (one for each stereoisomer).

In normal-phase HPLC, we see 2 peaks: one for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for racemic 2,4-pentanediol.
In chiral HPLC, we see 5 peaks: one for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and four for the stereoisomers of 2,4-pentanediol.

Thus, the chemist observes 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.
