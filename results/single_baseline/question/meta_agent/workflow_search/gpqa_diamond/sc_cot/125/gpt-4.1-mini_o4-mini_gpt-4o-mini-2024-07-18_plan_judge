Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has one stereocenter at C5. LAH reduces the C3 ketone to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter. With the existing S at C5, reduction gives two diastereomers ((3R,5S) and (3S,5S)), separable on normal-phase HPLC (2 peaks) and appearing as two peaks on chiral HPLC (still single enantiomers).

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione reduced by NaBH4 gives a 2,4-diol with two stereocenters (C2 and C4). There are three stereoisomers: the achiral meso form and the enantiomeric pair (R,R) and (S,S). On normal-phase HPLC, the enantiomers coelute (1 peak) and meso is separate (2 peaks total). On chiral HPLC, the enantiomers separate (2 peaks) plus meso (1 peak), giving 3 peaks.

Combined: Normal-phase sees 2 (Reaction I) + 2 (Reaction II) = 4 peaks. Chiral-phase sees 2 (Reaction I) + 3 (Reaction II) = 5 peaks.
