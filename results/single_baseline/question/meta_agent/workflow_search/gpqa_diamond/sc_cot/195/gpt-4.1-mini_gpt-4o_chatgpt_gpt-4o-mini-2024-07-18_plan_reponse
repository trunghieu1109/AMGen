        "response": "To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we consider the energy conservation. The total energy E of the system is the sum of kinetic energy K and potential energy U. For a relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is given by K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is U = (1/2)kx^2. At maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, so (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2 = (1/2)kA^2. Solving for v in terms of k, A, m, and c involves finding \u03b3 and using the relation \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). We derive v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2).\n\nAnswer:B)",
