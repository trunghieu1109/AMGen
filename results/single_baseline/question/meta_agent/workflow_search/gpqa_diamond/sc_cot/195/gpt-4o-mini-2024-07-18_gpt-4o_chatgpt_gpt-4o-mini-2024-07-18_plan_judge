proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we consider the energy of the system. In a non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is given by E = K.E. + P.E. = 1/2 mv^2 + 1/2 kx^2. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by K.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. At maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential, so E = 1/2 kA^2. At maximum speed v_max, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is kinetic: E = (γ - 1)mc^2. Setting these equal gives (γ - 1)mc^2 = 1/2 kA^2. Solving for v_max involves finding γ in terms of k, A, m, and c. Solving this equation gives v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which corresponds to choice 2.
