proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the relativistic effects that come into play due to the mass of the oscillator and the potential energy associated with its maximum amplitude. The maximum speed should account for the relativistic factor, which modifies classical mechanics. The correct formula will involve the constants of motion and the relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy in a relativistic framework.
