    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to identify the starting materials A and B for the given Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement reactions. The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves the conversion of a vicinal diol (pinacol) to a ketone (pinacolone) under acidic conditions. For the first reaction, A + H2SO4 ---&gt; 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, we need a starting material that is a diol and can rearrange to form the given ketone. The ketone product 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one suggests that the starting material A is a diol with a cyclohexane ring and two p-tolyl groups, which matches 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. For the second reaction, methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---&gt; B, we need to identify the ketone product B. The starting material is a diol with a methyl ester group, and the rearrangement will lead to a ketone with the ester group intact. The likely product is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, which matches the rearrangement pattern. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that matches these conclusions.
