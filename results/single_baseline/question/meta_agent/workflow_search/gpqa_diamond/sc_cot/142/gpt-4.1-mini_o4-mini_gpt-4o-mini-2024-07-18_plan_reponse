            "The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement is a chemical reaction involving the conversion of a pinacol molecule, containing two adjacent alcohol groups, into a pinacolone under acidic conditions. It proceeds through the protonation of one alcohol group, followed by a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a ketone (pinacolone) and the rearrangement of the molecule's structure.\nWhat are the starting materials and products of the following Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reactions?\nA + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\nmethyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B",

        "response": "We have two pinacol\u2010pinacolone rearrangements: one cyclic, one acyclic. For the cyclic case, the product is 2,2\u2010di\u2010p\u2010tolylcyclohexan\u20101\u2010one, so the starting diol A must be the corresponding 1,1\u2010diol on a cyclohexane ring, not cyclopentane. That rules out choices 2 and 3. For the acyclic case, methyl 2,3\u2010dihydroxy\u20102\u2010(p\u2010tolyl)butanoate under acid will protonate the tertiary OH at C2, lose water to form a benzylic cation, undergo a 1,2\u2010hydride shift from C3 to C2, giving a cation at C3 which then furnishes the ketone at C3. Thus the product B is methyl 3\u2010oxo\u20102\u2010(p\u2010tolyl)butanoate. That corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
