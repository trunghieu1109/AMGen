        "response": "Step 1: Starting from 5-bromo-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene, aqueous workup replaces the bromide with OH (SN1) to give secondary/tertiary alcohol A.\nStep 2: Oxidation with PDC converts that alcohol to the corresponding ketone B at C-5.\nStep 3: A Wittig reaction with H2C=PPh3 installs an exocyclic methylene at C-5, giving alkene C.\nStep 4: Treatment of the exocyclic methylene with TsOH protonates the alkene to form a tertiary carbocation at C-5, which triggers ring-expansion of the adjacent cyclobutane ring. Cleavage of a C\u2013C bond in the four-membered ring followed by reclosure yields a bicyclic pentalene framework (two fused five-membered rings). Methyl groups originally at 3a,4a migrate/relabel to give three methyl substituents at 3a,4 and 5a on the new bicyclic skeleton.\nThis sequence is characteristic of acid-catalyzed ring expansion of strained cyclobutanes, delivering the cyclopenta[c]pentalene core found in choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
