Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The non-Gaussianity measure for small cat-state amplitudes (alpha=0.5) is expected to be small but nonzero. Choices of order 1 or higher (1.38, 2.48) are too large; zero is only for Gaussian states. The plausible value is ~0.25.
