Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to evaluate the relative entropy measure using the provided parameters phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. We will compute the density matrices rho and tau, and then apply the formula for the relative entropy measure. After performing the calculations, we will compare the results with the given choices to determine the correct answer.
