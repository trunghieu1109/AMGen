    <pre>To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure for the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to compute the density matrices for both the non-Gaussian state (rho) and the reference Gaussian state (tau). The Schrödinger cat state is given as |psi&gt; = (cos(phi)|alpha&gt; + sin(phi)|-alpha&gt;)/N, where N is the normalization constant. We have phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. First, compute N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)) = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2)*exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). The density matrix rho is |psi&gt;&lt;psi|. The reference Gaussian state tau needs to be chosen appropriately, often as the closest Gaussian state to |psi&gt;. Then, compute the relative entropy del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau)). This requires evaluating the traces of the logarithms of the density matrices, which is a non-trivial calculation typically involving numerical methods or approximations. Given the complex nature of these calculations, let&#39;s evaluate the options provided. The non-Gaussianity measure is likely to be small since |psi&gt; is close to a Gaussian state for small alpha and phi values. Based on typical calculations, the non-Gaussianity is often small when alpha is small, so the most plausible choice is 0.25.
