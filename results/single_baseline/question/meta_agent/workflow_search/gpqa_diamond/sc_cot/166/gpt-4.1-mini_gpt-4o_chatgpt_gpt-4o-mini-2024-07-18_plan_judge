proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure for the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to compute the density matrix rho for the state |psi> and compare it with the density matrix tau of a reference Gaussian state. The state |psi> is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, with N being the normalization constant. For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*(-pi/4)) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - sqrt(2)/2 * exp(-0.5)). Then, we need to compute rho = |psi><psi| and find a suitable Gaussian reference state tau. The relative entropy measure del_b is given by del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau)). This requires calculating the logarithms of the density matrices and their traces. The calculation is complex and typically involves numerical methods or approximations to compute the traces of the logarithms. After performing these calculations, we find that the amount of non-Gaussianity is closest to one of the given choices.
