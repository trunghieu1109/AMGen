Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The spin state of the electron is given by the vector (3i, 4). To find the expectation value of S_y, we need to use the matrix representation of the spin operator S_y, which is (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix given in the problem. The expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector. First, normalize the state vector (3i, 4). The norm is sqrt((3i)*(3i)* + 4*4*) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5. The normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The expectation value is then (3i/5, 4/5)† (ħ/2)σ_y (3i/5, 4/5). Calculating this, we find ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = 24i/25. Thus, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2)(24i/25) = 12ħ/25.
