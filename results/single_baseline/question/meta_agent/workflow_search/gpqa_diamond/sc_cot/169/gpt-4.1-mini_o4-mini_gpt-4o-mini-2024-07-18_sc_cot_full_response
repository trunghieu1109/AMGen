Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent R1gb', content='The spinor is ψ = (3i, 4), with norm² = |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. Normalized ψ = (3i/5, 4/5). We compute ⟨σ_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ψ. σ_y ψ = [ -4i/5, -3/5 ], ψ† = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ], so ψ†(σ_y ψ) = (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5) = (12i²/25) - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25. Thus ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
