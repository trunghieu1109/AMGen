Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: IR shows broad O–H stretch (3400–2500 cm–1) and C=O at 1720 cm–1, NMR shows 10.5 ppm bs (COOH), two aromatic doublets (para disubstitution), and aliphatic signals (2.9 m,1H; 1.7 m,2H; 1.4 d,3H; 0.9 t,3H) matching a sec-butyl group. Thus X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (choice 2). Treatment with HI/red P reduces the –COOH to –CH3, giving p-sec-butyltoluene, i.e. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
