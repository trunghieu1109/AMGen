        "response": "The IR data shows a broad peak at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a C=O stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with a para substitution pattern. The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) and the multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) along with the doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) and the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggest an alkyl chain, possibly a sec-butyl group. Given this data, Compound X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group, leading to the formation of 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:A)",
