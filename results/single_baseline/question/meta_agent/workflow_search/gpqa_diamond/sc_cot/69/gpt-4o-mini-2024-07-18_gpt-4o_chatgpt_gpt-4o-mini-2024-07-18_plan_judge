proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to deduce the identities of the chemicals involved based on the reactions described. 
1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. A plausible candidate for A is iron (Fe) and for B is chlorine (Cl2), forming FeCl3, which is a reddish solid. 
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce hazardous product E. If C is FeCl3, and D is ammonia (NH3), they could form Fe(NH3)6Cl3, but it's not hazardous. A more likely scenario is that D is hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and E is Fe2S3, which is hazardous. 
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. If C is FeCl3, it reacts with water to form Fe(OH)3 (which dehydrates to Fe2O3) and releases HCl (F, strong acid) and HClO (G, weak acid). 
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, used as a solvent. If D is H2S and B is Cl2, they form HCl and SCl2, but SCl2 is not a common solvent. If D is NH3 and B is HCl, they form NH4Cl, but that's not a solvent. If D is H2O and B is Cl2, they form HOCl, but that's not a solvent. If D is H2 and B is Cl2, they form HCl, which is not a solvent. 

Given the hazardous nature of E and its formation from a metal sulfide, it is likely Fe2S3, which has a C2 symmetry group. 

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2.
