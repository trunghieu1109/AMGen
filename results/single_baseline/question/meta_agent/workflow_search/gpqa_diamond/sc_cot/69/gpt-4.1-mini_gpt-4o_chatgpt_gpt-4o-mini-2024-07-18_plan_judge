proposed answer: We need to identify the compounds based on the given reactions. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. C is a bright red product, which suggests it might be a complex compound. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it forms hazardous product E. C also reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F and G, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Gas D reacts with gas B to form H, a solvent. 

A plausible scenario is that A is P4 (white phosphorus), B is Cl2 (chlorine gas), D is NH3 (ammonia), and C is PCl5 (phosphorus pentachloride). 

P4 + 8 Cl2 -> 4 PCl5 (C)
PCl5 + 4 NH3 -> P(NH2)3 (E) + 3 NH4Cl
PCl5 + H2O -> POCl3 + 2 HCl (F) + H3PO4 (G)
NH3 + HCl -> NH4Cl (H)

E is P(NH2)3, which is hazardous due to its reactivity. The molecular symmetry of P(NH2)3 is C3v, but that option is not present. 

Re-evaluating, if E is a different hazardous compound, such as PF3, it would have a C3v symmetry. However, given the options, if E were PF5, it would be D3h, which is also not present. The closest symmetry for a linear hazardous compound might be D∞h, which corresponds to a linear molecule. 

If we assume E is PF5, its symmetry is D3h, but if E is a linear hazardous compound, it might be D∞h.

Answer:D∞h
Extracted answer: D∞h
Correct answer: 2
