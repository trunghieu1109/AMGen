Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the molecular symmetry group of product E, we need to consider the nature of the reactions and the products formed. Since E is described as extremely hazardous, it may have a complex structure. The options given include various symmetry groups: C2, C2v, D4h, and D∞h. D∞h is typically associated with linear molecules that have an infinite rotational symmetry, while D4h indicates a more complex structure with a higher symmetry. Without specific details about the structure of E, it is challenging to definitively determine its symmetry group. However, based on the information provided, D4h could suggest a more complex arrangement than the others. Therefore, I will choose D4h as the most likely symmetry group for E.

Answer:D4h
Extracted answer: D4h
Correct answer: 2
