            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

        "response": "To find the probabilities of measuring the values for observables P and Q, we first need to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices corresponding to these operators. The state of the system is given as a column matrix, and we will use this to calculate the probabilities after the measurements. The measurement of P will collapse the state to one of its eigenstates, and then we will compute the probability of measuring Q in that collapsed state.\n\nAnswer:1/3",
