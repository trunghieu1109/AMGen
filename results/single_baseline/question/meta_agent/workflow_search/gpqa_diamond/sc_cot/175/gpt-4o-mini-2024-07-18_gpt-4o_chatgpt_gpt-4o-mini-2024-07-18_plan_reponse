            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

        "response": "First, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator P. The matrix for P is: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. We solve the characteristic equation det(P - lambda*I) = 0 to find the eigenvalues of P. After finding the eigenvalues, we solve (P - lambda*I)v = 0 to find the corresponding eigenvectors. Once we have the eigenvectors, we express the initial state vector (-1, 2, 1) in terms of the eigenbasis of P. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude (coefficient) of the corresponding eigenvector. For the eigenvalue 0 of P, we find the probability of measuring it. Next, we consider the operator Q, which is Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. We find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We need the state of the system after measuring 0 for P, and then we project this state onto the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of the amplitude of this projection. Finally, we multiply the probabilities of the two measurements to find the joint probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nAnswer:1/6",
