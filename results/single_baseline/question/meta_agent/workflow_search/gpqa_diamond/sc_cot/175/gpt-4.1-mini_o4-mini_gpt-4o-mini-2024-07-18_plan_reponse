            "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?",

Compute p(P=0)=|<u|\u03c6>|\u00b2 = |(-1-1)/(\u221a2\u221a6)|\u00b2 = (\u221a(1/3))\u00b2=1/3. After collapse the state is |u>. Q=-1 projector is |e\u2083><e\u2083| with e\u2083=(0,0,1), so p(Q=-1|P=0)=|<e\u2083|u>|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)\u00b2=1/2. Joint probability= (1/3)(1/2)=1/6.\n\nAnswer:B)",
