            "All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) are correct except\n\n\n",
            "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ",
            "SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n",
            "The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ",

        "response": "To determine which statement is incorrect, let's analyze each choice: \n1) Choice 1 describes programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS-CoV, and this is generally accurate as both viruses use a -1 frameshift for polyprotein synthesis. \n2) Choice 2 discusses the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex and its role in exonuclease activity, which is known to be involved in RNA proofreading, but the statement about preventing dsRNA breakdown seems incorrect as the exonuclease activity is more about proofreading rather than preventing breakdown. \n3) Choice 3 describes ORF3a's role in apoptosis via caspase-8, which is consistent with known mechanisms where ORF3a can trigger apoptosis through caspase pathways. \n4) Choice 4 mentions the frameshifting rate correlation with pseudoknot conformations, which aligns with studies on frameshift signals. \nTherefore, the incorrect statement is likely choice 2, due to the inaccurate detail about preventing dsRNA breakdown.\n\nAnswer:B)",
