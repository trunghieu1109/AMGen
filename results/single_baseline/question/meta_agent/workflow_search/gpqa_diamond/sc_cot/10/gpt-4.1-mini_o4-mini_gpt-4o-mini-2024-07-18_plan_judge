Question: Example(question='All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n', choice1='Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.', choice2='SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ', choice3='SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n', choice4='The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Reviewing each statement:
1) SARS-CoV-2 uses a −1 ribosomal frameshift near the 5′ end with a slippery sequence and pseudoknot, very similar in conformation to SARS-CoV’s pseudoknot—this is correct.
2) nsp14’s ExoN domain does bind nsp10 to form an active exonuclease that degrades mismatched RNA (i.e., it promotes breakdown of dsRNA containing errors), not “prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.” Thus this statement is incorrect.
3) ORF3a does activate caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) without altering Bcl-2 (intrinsic pathway) expression, indicating apoptosis via the extrinsic route—this is supported by studies.
4) The efficiency of −1 frameshifting correlates with the structural heterogeneity of the pseudoknot, and both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals exhibit two conformers under tension—this is correct.
