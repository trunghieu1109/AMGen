Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 56D6', content='To find a we normalize the wave function ψ(x) = (a/√(1+x)) – 0.5 i over x from 1 to 3. The probability density is |ψ|^2 = (a^2/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Normalization requires ∫1^3 [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1. Compute ∫1^3 a^2/(1+x) dx = a^2[ln(1+x)]1→3 = a^2(ln4 − ln2) = a^2 ln2. And ∫1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25·2 = 0.5. So a^2 ln2 + 0.5 = 1 ⇒ a^2 ln2 = 0.5 ⇒ a^2 = 0.5/ln2 ≈ 0.7213 ⇒ a ≈ √0.7213 ≈ 0.85.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
