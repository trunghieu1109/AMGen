Question: Example(question='We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.1', choice3='0.35', choice4='0.6', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. To find the value of 'a', we need to normalize the wave function over the range where the particle can be found, which is x=1 to x=3. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over this range equals 1. The probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function. The modulus of the wave function is |(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i|. We calculate this modulus, square it to get the probability density, and integrate from x=1 to x=3. Set this integral equal to 1 and solve for 'a'.
