Question: Example(question='We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).\nWe know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:\n( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.\nWhen measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).\nWhat is the numerical value of “a”?', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.1', choice3='0.35', choice4='0.6', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find a we normalize the wave function ψ(x) = (a/√(1+x)) – 0.5 i over x from 1 to 3. The probability density is |ψ|^2 = (a^2/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Normalization requires ∫1^3 [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1. Compute ∫1^3 a^2/(1+x) dx = a^2[ln(1+x)]1→3 = a^2(ln4 − ln2) = a^2 ln2. And ∫1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25·2 = 0.5. So a^2 ln2 + 0.5 = 1 ⇒ a^2 ln2 = 0.5 ⇒ a^2 = 0.5/ln2 ≈ 0.7213 ⇒ a ≈ √0.7213 ≈ 0.85.
