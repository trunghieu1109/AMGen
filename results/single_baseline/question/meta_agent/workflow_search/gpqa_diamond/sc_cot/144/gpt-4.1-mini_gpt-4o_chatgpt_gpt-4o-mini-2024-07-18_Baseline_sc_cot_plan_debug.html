    <pre>To determine the number of stereoisomers, we need to identify the number of chiral centers and double bonds with E/Z isomerism in the compound. The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Let&#39;s analyze it: 1. The chain has 11 carbons (undeca-), with double bonds at positions 3 and 7. 2. The substituents are: - a chlorine at position 6, - an ethyl group at position 9, - a methyl group at position 2, - an alcohol (OH) group at position 5. 3. Chiral centers: - Carbon 5 is attached to four different groups: H, OH, the rest of the chain, and the portion of the chain before it, making it a chiral center. - Carbon 6 is attached to four different groups: H, Cl, the rest of the chain, and the portion of the chain before it, making it a chiral center. 4. Double bonds with E/Z isomerism: - The double bond at position 3 has E/Z isomerism. - The double bond at position 7 has E/Z isomerism. There are 2 chiral centers and 2 double bonds with E/Z isomerism. The number of stereoisomers is given by 2^(number of chiral centers + number of E/Z double bonds) = 2^(2 + 2) = 2^4 = 16.
