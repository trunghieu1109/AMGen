Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound, we need to identify the number of stereocenters present. The compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol has multiple stereogenic centers: 1) The double bonds at positions 3 and 7 can exhibit cis/trans (E/Z) isomerism. Each double bond can have 2 configurations (E or Z), giving 2^2 = 4 possibilities. 2) The carbon at position 5 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen, a hydroxyl group (OH), a chlorine-substituted carbon chain, and a carbon chain with an ethyl group. This adds 2 more configurations, as a chiral center can be R or S. Therefore, the total number of stereoisomers is the product of the possibilities: 4 (from the double bonds) * 2 (from the chiral center) = 8 stereoisomers.
