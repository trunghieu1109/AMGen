        "response": "Step 1: Number the chain from 1 to 11. Step 2: Identify sp3 stereocenters: C5 has OH, H, and two different carbon substituents \u2192 chiral. C9 has ethyl, H, and two different carbon substituents \u2192 chiral. No other sp3 centers. \u2192 2 stereocenters \u2192 2^2 = 4 configurations. Step 3: Identify stereogenic double bonds: C3=C4 and C7=C8 each have two different substituents on both carbons \u2192 each gives E/Z isomerism \u2192 2^2 = 4 configurations. Step 4: Total stereoisomers = (2^#chiral)(2^#double bonds) = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 \u2192 choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)",
