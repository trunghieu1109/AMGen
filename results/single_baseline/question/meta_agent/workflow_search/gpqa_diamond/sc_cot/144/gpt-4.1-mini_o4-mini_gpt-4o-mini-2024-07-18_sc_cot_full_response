Question: {'question': 'How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', 'choice1': '8', 'choice2': '16', 'choice3': '32', 'choice4': '4'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent T9Xf', content='Step 1: Number the chain from 1 to 11. Step 2: Identify sp3 stereocenters: C5 has OH, H, and two different carbon substituents → chiral. C9 has ethyl, H, and two different carbon substituents → chiral. No other sp3 centers. → 2 stereocenters → 2^2 = 4 configurations. Step 3: Identify stereogenic double bonds: C3=C4 and C7=C8 each have two different substituents on both carbons → each gives E/Z isomerism → 2^2 = 4 configurations. Step 4: Total stereoisomers = (2^#chiral)(2^#double bonds) = 4 × 4 = 16 → choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
