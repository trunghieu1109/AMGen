Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Number the chain from 1 to 11. Step 2: Identify sp3 stereocenters: C5 has OH, H, and two different carbon substituents → chiral. C9 has ethyl, H, and two different carbon substituents → chiral. No other sp3 centers. → 2 stereocenters → 2^2 = 4 configurations. Step 3: Identify stereogenic double bonds: C3=C4 and C7=C8 each have two different substituents on both carbons → each gives E/Z isomerism → 2^2 = 4 configurations. Step 4: Total stereoisomers = (2^#chiral)(2^#double bonds) = 4 × 4 = 16 → choice B.
