Question: Example(question='Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2×2 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue, φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c∙S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? ', choice1='The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.', choice2='The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.', choice3='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1. ', choice4='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π. ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator Ay, we need to analyze the properties of the matrix S and the implications of the eigenvalue equation. The matrix S given is a standard representation of angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics, specifically for spin-1/2 systems. The eigenvalues of such a matrix typically relate to the quantized values of angular momentum, which, for spin-1/2 particles, are ±h/2. The eigenvectors correspond to the states that represent the spin states of the muon. We should evaluate each statement based on this understanding.
