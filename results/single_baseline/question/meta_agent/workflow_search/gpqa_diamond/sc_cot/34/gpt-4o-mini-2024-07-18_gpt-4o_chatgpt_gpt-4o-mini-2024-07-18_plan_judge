proposed answer: The matrix S given is the Y-component of the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle. It is known that the spin operators satisfy the commutation relations of angular momentum operators. The matrix S is given as S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli matrix σ_y. The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are [1, i] and [1, -i]. The operator Ay = c*S, where c = h/4π, scales these eigenvalues by c. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ±(h/4π) and the eigenvectors remain the same. The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 (since Ay and A^2 commute), but they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az do not commute (they satisfy the commutation relation [Ay, Az] = iAx). Therefore, the correct statement is that the eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.
