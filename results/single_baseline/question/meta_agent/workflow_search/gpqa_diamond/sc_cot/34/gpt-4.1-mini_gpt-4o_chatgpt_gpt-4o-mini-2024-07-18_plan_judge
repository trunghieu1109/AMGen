Question: Example(question='Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2×2 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue, φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c∙S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? ', choice1='The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.', choice2='The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.', choice3='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix Ay, which is given as Ay = c * S, where c = h/4π and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S is given as S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. This is similar to the Pauli matrix σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay = (h/4π) * S, the eigenvalues of Ay will be (h/4π) * λ, where λ are the eigenvalues of S. The eigenvalues of S, being similar to σ_y, are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±(h/4π). The eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues are the same as those for the matrix S. The statement that is correct must align with these findings. Choice 1 discusses the eigenfunctions of Ay and their relation to A^2 and Az, which is plausible. Choice 2 suggests the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which is not necessarily true as eigenfunctions are specific to eigenvalues. Choice 3 and 4 discuss imaginary and real parts of eigenvalues, which do not match the form of ±(h/4π). Thus, choice 1 seems the most reasonable.
