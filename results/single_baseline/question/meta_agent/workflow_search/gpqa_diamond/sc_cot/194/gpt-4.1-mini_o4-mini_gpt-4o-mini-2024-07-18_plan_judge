Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We require both transit and occultation: b2=(a2/R*)cos i≤1+Rp2/R*. From first planet b1=0.2=(a1/R*)cos i⇒cos i=b1 R*/a1. Thus a2_max=a1·(b2_max/b1) with b2_max=1+Rp2/R*≈1+2.5 Re/(1.5 R☉)≈1.0153 gives a2/a1≈5.0765. By Kepler’s law P∝a3/2 so P2≈3 d·(5.0765)3/2≈3·11.445≈34.3 d, closest to ~33.5 d.
