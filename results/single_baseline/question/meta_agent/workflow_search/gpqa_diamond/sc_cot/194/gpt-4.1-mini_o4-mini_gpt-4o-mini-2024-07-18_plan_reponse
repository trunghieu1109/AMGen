            "Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.",

        "response": "We require both transit and occultation: b2=(a2/R*)cos i\u22641+Rp2/R*. From first planet b1=0.2=(a1/R*)cos i\u21d2cos i=b1 R*/a1. Thus a2_max=a1\u00b7(b2_max/b1) with b2_max=1+Rp2/R*\u22481+2.5 Re/(1.5 R\u2609)\u22481.0153 gives a2/a1\u22485.0765. By Kepler\u2019s law P\u221da3/2 so P2\u22483 d\u00b7(5.0765)3/2\u22483\u00b711.445\u224834.3 d, closest to ~33.5 d.\n\nAnswer:B)",
