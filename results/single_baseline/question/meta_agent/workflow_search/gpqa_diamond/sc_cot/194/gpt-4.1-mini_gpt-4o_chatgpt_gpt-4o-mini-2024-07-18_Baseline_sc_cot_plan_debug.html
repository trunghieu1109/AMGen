    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, which means it is close to the center of the star during transit. The second planet must also transit and be occulted, which requires that it remains within the star&#39;s radius when viewed from Earth. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is when the planet just grazes the star, which is when the impact parameter equals the star&#39;s radius. Since the second planet shares the same orbital plane, it will have the same impact parameter as the first planet. The star&#39;s radius is 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius. The orbital period scales with the semi-major axis, which scales with the cube root of the stellar mass (assuming the same stellar mass for both planets). The second planet&#39;s period must be such that it still transits, so it cannot be too far from the star. The maximum period can be estimated by considering the ratio of the star&#39;s radius to the maximum possible impact parameter. Since the first planet&#39;s orbital period is 3 days, the second planet&#39;s maximum period is longer, but not too long to avoid missing transit. The calculations result in a maximum period of approximately 33.5 days.
