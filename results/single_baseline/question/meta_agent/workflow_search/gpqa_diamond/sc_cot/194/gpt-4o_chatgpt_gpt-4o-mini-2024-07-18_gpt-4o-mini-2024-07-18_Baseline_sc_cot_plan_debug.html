    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that can exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the sizes of the planets and the star, along with the geometry of their orbits. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and orbits a star of 1.5 Solar radii. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. For both transit and occultation to occur, the second planet must fit within the transit zone of the first planet. The transit duration and the orbital period can be calculated using Kepler&#39;s laws and the geometry of the situation. The maximum orbital period of the second planet will be related to its size compared to the first planet and the star&#39;s size. Given the choices, we can estimate that the period should be significantly longer than the first planet&#39;s 3 days due to its larger radius. The options provided suggest that the period could be around 7.5 days, 12.5 days, 33.5 days, or 37.5 days. After considering the sizes and the geometry, the most reasonable maximum period that allows for both transit and occultation is approximately 12.5 days.
