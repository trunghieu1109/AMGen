    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words &#34;size estimate&#34; followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee.

    <pre>To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we need to analyze the given expression for the size estimate. The expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The key part to focus on is the factor 1/(4pi)^6. In quantum field theory, loop diagrams often have factors of 1/(4pi)^2 for each loop, due to the integration over loop momenta in four-dimensional spacetime. Therefore, a factor of 1/(4pi)^6 suggests that there are 3 loops, as each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2. This is a common way to estimate the number of loops based on the dimensional analysis of the prefactor in the perturbative expansion.
