Question: {'question': 'Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?', 'choice1': '3', 'choice2': '1', 'choice3': '2', 'choice4': '6'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mqRp', content='In perturbative QFT each loop brings a factor of roughly 1/(4π)^2. Here we see 1/(4π)^6 = [1/(4π)^2]^3, so 2L = 6 ⇒ L = 3 loops. The coupling powers α^3 and g^2 just reflect vertex factors but don’t change the loop count.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
