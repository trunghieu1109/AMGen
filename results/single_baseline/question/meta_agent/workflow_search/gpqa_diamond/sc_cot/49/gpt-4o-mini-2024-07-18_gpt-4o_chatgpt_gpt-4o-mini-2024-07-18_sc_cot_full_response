Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Rpq6', content='To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we need to analyze the given expression for the size estimate. The expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The key part to focus on is the factor 1/(4pi)^6. In quantum field theory, loop diagrams often have factors of 1/(4pi)^2 for each loop, due to the integration over loop momenta in four-dimensional spacetime. Therefore, a factor of 1/(4pi)^6 suggests that there are 3 loops, as each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2. This is a common way to estimate the number of loops based on the dimensional analysis of the prefactor in the perturbative expansion.\n\nAnswer:3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
