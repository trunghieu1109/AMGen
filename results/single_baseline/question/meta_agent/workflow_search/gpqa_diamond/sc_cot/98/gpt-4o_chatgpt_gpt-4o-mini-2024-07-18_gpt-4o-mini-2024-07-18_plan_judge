Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To identify the compound, we need to analyze the information provided by the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers suggests the presence of an O-H bond, typical of carboxylic acids, which aligns with the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) in all choices. The strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), which is also consistent with carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR spectrum shows no vinyl hydrogens, which rules out any alkenes. The specific patterns of splitting (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets) suggest a complex hydrogen environment, likely due to the presence of multiple adjacent carbons with differing hydrogen counts. Analyzing each choice, we consider the structure and the number of hydrogen atoms in each case. The presence of two -CH3 groups and the complexity of splitting patterns indicate that the compound could be CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, which fits the NMR splitting patterns well. Therefore, the answer is the first choice.
