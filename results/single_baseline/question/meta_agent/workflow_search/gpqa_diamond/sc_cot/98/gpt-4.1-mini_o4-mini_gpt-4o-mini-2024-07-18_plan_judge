Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The IR shows broad 3000 cm⁻¹ (O–H) and strong 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O), so it’s a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR has two distinct CH multiplets: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), the other a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). In CH3CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–CH(CH2CH3)–COOH (choice4) both CH groups would each couple to two CH2’s and one CH, giving dtt for each, so you’d see two dtt’s. In CH3–CH(CH2CH3)–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–COOH (choice3), the first CH (adjacent to CH3 and CH2) couples to its CH3 (quartet), its CH2 substituent (triplet), and the vicinal CH (doublet), giving dtq; the second CH couples to two CH2’s and the vicinal CH, giving dtt. This matches the observed dtq and dtt, so the compound is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH, choice3.
