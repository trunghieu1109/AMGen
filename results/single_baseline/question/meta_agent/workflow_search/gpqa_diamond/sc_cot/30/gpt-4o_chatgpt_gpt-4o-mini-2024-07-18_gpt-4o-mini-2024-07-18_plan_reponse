        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "To determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3, we need to analyze the transformations that occur during the reactions. Toluene undergoes nitration, followed by oxidation and a reaction with acetone and sodium hydroxide. The final product will have specific symmetry based on its molecular structure. Without the exact structure of product 3, we can infer that it likely has a certain level of symmetry based on common reaction outcomes in organic chemistry. The choices provided suggest different symmetry groups, and we need to select the one that is most consistent with the expected symmetry of a product derived from these reactions.\n\nAnswer:B",
