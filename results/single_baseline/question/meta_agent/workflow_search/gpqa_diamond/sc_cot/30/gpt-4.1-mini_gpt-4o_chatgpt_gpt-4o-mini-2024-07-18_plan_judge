proposed answer: First, we need to determine the products of each reaction step. Toluene, when treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, undergoes nitration to form nitrotoluene (Product 1). The methyl group in toluene directs the nitro group to the ortho and para positions, but para-nitrotoluene is the major product due to sterics. Next, when para-nitrotoluene is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, the methyl group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, forming para-nitrobenzoic acid (Product 2). Finally, when para-nitrobenzoic acid is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, it undergoes an aldol-like condensation reaction with acetone, potentially forming a chalcone-like structure. However, the exact nature of Product 3 is unclear without more specific information about the reaction conditions. Assuming a simple aldol condensation, the product would have an extended conjugated system. The symmetry of the final product would likely be determined by the planar nature of the aromatic ring and any additional conjugation, which would be consistent with a Cs symmetry group due to the presence of a mirror plane.
