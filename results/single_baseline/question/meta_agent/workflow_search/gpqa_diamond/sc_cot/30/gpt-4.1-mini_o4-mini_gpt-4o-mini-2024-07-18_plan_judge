Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Toluene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ gives mainly p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).
Step 2: Oxidation of the benzylic methyl group (MnO₂/H₂SO₄) converts 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.
Step 3: Claisen–Schmidt condensation of two equivalents of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone and NaOH gives the symmetric dibenzalacetone derivative: (4-nitrophenyl)CH=CH–CO–CH=CH(4-nitrophenyl).
This molecule is planar and has a C₂ rotation axis (swapping the two aryl ends) plus a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane), corresponding to point group C₂h.
