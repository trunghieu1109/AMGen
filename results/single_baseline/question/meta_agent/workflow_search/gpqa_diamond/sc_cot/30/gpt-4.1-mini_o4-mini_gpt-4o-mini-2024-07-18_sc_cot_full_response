Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Cc5z', content='Step 1: Toluene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ gives mainly p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\nStep 2: Oxidation of the benzylic methyl group (MnO₂/H₂SO₄) converts 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\nStep 3: Claisen–Schmidt condensation of two equivalents of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone and NaOH gives the symmetric dibenzalacetone derivative: (4-nitrophenyl)CH=CH–CO–CH=CH(4-nitrophenyl).\nThis molecule is planar and has a C₂ rotation axis (swapping the two aryl ends) plus a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane), corresponding to point group C₂h.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
