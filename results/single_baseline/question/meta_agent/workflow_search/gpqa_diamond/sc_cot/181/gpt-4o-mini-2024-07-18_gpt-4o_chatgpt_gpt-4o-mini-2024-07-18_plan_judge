Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It is derived under the assumption of a trap-free, single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The equation assumes that the current is dominated by space-charge effects and that the carrier injection is efficient, meaning there is no significant barrier to carrier injection (Ohmic contact). Therefore, the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is that it is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
