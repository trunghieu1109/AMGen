            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",

        "response": "We have an equimolar mixture of two salts A and B (n mol each) weighing 7.20 g. Upon heating, only a gas mixture forms. Passing the hot gases through tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2) absorbs water: \u0394m\u2081=3.60 g \u21d2 n\u1d42(H\u2082O)=3.60/18=0.20 mol. Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) shows no mass change \u21d2 no CO\u2082 or acidic gases. Tube 3 (red-hot Cu) forms CuO and gains 0.80 g \u21d2 O\u2082 consumed: \u0394m=0.80 g; 2Cu+O\u2082\u21922CuO gives 32 g CuO\u2013Cu mass per O\u2082, so n\u1d42(O\u2082)=0.80/32=0.025 mol. Remaining gas C (after trapping H\u2082O and O\u2082) is 2.24 L at STP \u21d2 n=2.24/22.4=0.10 mol of N\u2082. Check mass: H\u2082O 3.6 g+O\u2082 0.80 g+N\u2082(0.10\u00d728)=2.8 g totals 7.20 g OK. Let A and B each be n=0.05 mol. A candidate for producing only N\u2082 and H\u2082O is ammonium nitrite: NH\u2084NO\u2082\u2192N\u2082+2H\u2082O. B that yields H\u2082O plus N\u2082O which on hot Cu decomposes to N\u2082+\u00bdO\u2082 is ammonium nitrate: NH\u2084NO\u2083\u2192N\u2082O+2H\u2082O; 2 N\u2082O\u21922 N\u2082+O\u2082. Per 0.05 mol each: H\u2082O:0.05\u00d72+0.05\u00d72=0.20 mol; N\u2082:0.05\u00d71+0.05\u00d71=0.10 mol; O\u2082:0.05\u00d70.5=0.025 mol. Mass:0.05\u00d7(64+80)=7.2 g matches. Thus A=NH\u2084NO\u2082 has 2 N+4 H+2 O=8 atoms; B=NH\u2084NO\u2083 has 2 N+4 H+3 O=9 atoms. Total atoms=8+9=17.\n\nAnswer:C)",
